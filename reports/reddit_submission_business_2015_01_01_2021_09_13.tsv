hiring managers what do you consider to be the most versatile business major?	i'm going into college soon without a clue about what i'd like to do. i sort of like the idea of marketing, because i think it will allow me to do a lot of creative problem solving, and get a good job out of college. i also think there are a lot of other degrees in business that allow for that as well, but i don't have a clue as to what they are. i know money isn't everything by any means, but to me, making a good amount of money to live comfortably is very important. when you hire prospective employees, what major is considered the most useful/versatile to get good paying jobs? sidenote if you have any advice at all about college majors or college in general it would be beyond appreciated at this point.	brettmvp97	/r/business/comments/2r16v9/hiring_managers_what_do_you_consider_to_be_the/	2	5	0	0.86	1420144375.0

i run a small business and want to save some of my profits in an investment-type account can i legally do this?	i have a small business that i work on when i'm not at my full-time job - is there a way for me to take the money that i've made in that business, and reinvest it under the business? i'm not sure if i'm taking an extra, unnecessary step by trying to invest as a business - i'm thinking that keeping the funds separate would be something i need to do. i've yet to pay myself any money from what i've made from doing this. i really am not an expert on business finance - just kind of thinking out loud...	quesadilla_r	/r/business/comments/2rpcxq/i_run_a_small_business_and_want_to_save_some_of/	4	5	0	0.7	1420687231.0

what are some effective ways to market a small business via social media/the internet?	 some background i work at a small, local computer shop repairing computers. it's just 1 store, locally operated. we do repairs and sell devices. we've been open 15-20 years . it's a small business, i'm the only other repair technician there besides the owner. i'm concerned we're losing a lot of business to big name companies like best buy, so i'm hoping to find a way to get our name out there. we're much more committed to ensuring our customers are satisfied; we can resolve much more complicated fixes than the geek squad can, and we don't attempt to sell people things they don't need/charge them for every small thing-ie if someone comes in with a 1 click fix that most people would know how to fix, we usually won't charge. lately, we haven't been seeing enough customers. the owner is concerned that we may have to shut down if business doesn't pick up. wishing to see the business succeed, and wanting to secure my job, i offered to update the website upon completing my html class, and utilizing social media. since english isn't the owner 's native language, i often handle communications. the question with the market being heavily social media based, what are the best ways to use it to attract customers? we prefer solutions that would be either free, or low cost. what i've considered -create a facebook page for the business. -when customers express satisfaction to us, we request they they review us online or like us on facebook if they have an account. despite having hundreds of people that have driven back and come in just to thank us, sounding ecstatic, we've had all of 2 people review our business online since we haven't asked before-and both are negative reviews. -occasionally post special deals on our facebook page -provide monthly articles on the website/facebook page with guides to using computers/preventing issues. any other ideas to what we could do to improve business via online social media? most importantly in the short term at low/no cost, but long term solutions are nice too.	skilliard4	/r/business/comments/2tf4y6/what_are_some_effective_ways_to_market_a_small/	5	5	0	0.78	1422033240.0

i want to buy the business from my boss.	i'm 23 and i work in a sandwich shop for a mom and pop. i started at 15 at subway, then worked my way into management at potbelly before realizing i'm a lot more about the creativity of making good food over the corporate fast food thing. i started working with this shop two years ago. three or so months into my tenure, my boss mentions to me in a moment of confidence that they want to sell but they're under too much water . the business was not doing well. the menu was too big and outright incomprehensible. we sold out of our best seller on a daily basis while we were throwing out less popular items just as often. since learning the recipes, i've taken over almost every aspect of the shop. i order our product and bread. i shrunk the menu and made it easy. we don't sell out, and we no longer carry the non sellers. i started delivering locally. i've staffed the shop with hard workers i've met through my short years and we work wonders. things are on the up turn, but the owners resist change at every turn, which i don't understand because they have obviously checked out. the lease is up in december and i don't think he wants to renew. we have excellent food, a great location, and i've finally amassed my dream crew to work behind me. i don't have any money or credit, but i have some investors who know my quality of work and capacity for work and they are ready to back me. what do i need to know about buying a business? how can i determine what the business is worth? how do i start the conversation with the owners? i'm very uneducated in the matter, and before putting up more of my non-money and going to college i thought i'd ask for your input. thank you. edit thank you all for the advice and support. i had to sequester my phone throughout the workday so as to avoid the temptation of reading each response as it came in. i have decided that i am going to open my own shop, and do things my way from the ground up. perhaps i may purchase some of the couple's equipment if it looks like they are going to shut down toward the end of the year, though i honestly think i could buy better and cheaper elsewhere. i have put out of my mind the idea of purchasing the business and/or any of this man's debt. they have dug themselves a big hole, and i will continue to try to get them out so long as they pay me well, and also for the learning experience. for as well as they have been to me, i work hard for all i give them in return and owe them nothing more. in the meantime i plan to focus on creating my own business plan, designing my own menu and meeting with both an accountant and a lawyer. fortunately i have both of those close in the family. i've even just signed up for a workshop on starting a business. thanks, /r/business, for helping me decide that i don't want to buy the business from my boss.	onthewaytoelsa	/r/business/comments/2u21u5/i_want_to_buy_the_business_from_my_boss/	58	199	0	0.94	1422512850.0
need some more advice about my contractor	history tl;dr contractor keeps putting everything off. won't deliver what he's supposed to citing endless delays, won't even keep meetings that he calls for also giving never ending excuses. i've received nothing but can't today, can do at x time tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and again can't today, can do at x time tomorrow ... i'm about ready to tell this guy to go fuck himself but i'm adamant about not letting my feelings about all this crap get in the way of my dealings with him. bottom line is this has got to stop and i'm a total loss about how to ensure that it does... thinking more rationally, i'm inclined to tell him can't do tomorrow, suggest we reschedule for a time in the moderately distant future when you're less likely to be engaged my girlfriend who i talk to about my frustrations tells me i should impose a deadline, but how do i enforce it? the man's had several deadlines over the last 9 months since i hired him and at every turn has come up with a lame excuse for why he couldn't deliver on time... if i could get help with the wording of an email to send him, that'd be fantastic.	ortund	/r/business/comments/2u2dpk/need_some_more_advice_about_my_contractor/	3	2	0	0.75	1422523263.0
anyone know where i could use a tariff code search and cross-reference the information with what countries are importing/amounts of imports?	basically, i need to use a couple of tariff codes a business gave me, use the tariff codes to figure out what the products are, then see what other domestic markets import similar things. so for example, a tariff code might reveal that it's a woman's leather handbag, cross-searching through export.gov or some other site, might reveal that japan imports woman's leather goods. if any of you know of a website that can do this, please tell me. or if you know how to use export.gov in the manner i'm asking, please explain to me how i can use the site for this purpose. thanks to you all in advance.

need advice on my business.	i'm not sure if this is the proper place to go but i'll give it a shot. i'm a young entrepreneur attempting to start a website business. since i lack the skills to make a website and that the website is far too intricate i would think for myself, with no programming experience to attempt i will need to go to a web designer. here is my problem. how do i ensure that my idea will not be stolen? since i will be going to this person to make my website, and host it, i'm assuming they will have full access to my website. what is stopping them taking the idea as there own? do i need to turn to solicitors or lawyers or anything? i have a very low budget. or will they themselves sort this out with me? i'm worried the web designer will take the idea if they please and there is nothing there to stop them doing so. any advice on anything i have mentioned would be greatly appreciated.

how much equity should i pursue?	i am entering into a software/website startup with a successful business person. it's his idea, his business plan, and his funding . i will do all of the technical design & implementation. as a freelancer, i wouldn't touch this project for less than $20k to develop it, probably more like $30k. i imagine a big software house would charge at least $200k. however, i want equity, and i have a couple questions. my first question is how much equity should i aim for? in the initial stage of this business, there aren't really any costs except for the development cost. because of that, there is the potential situation where i will spend 3-4 months working to develop it while he sits back & relaxes. that's not to say he won't be a good partner, but i would be initially risking 3-4 months of my time. my solution to this is to get equity + cash. getting paid a cut-rate to develop the software would hedge my risk, and it would also put some of his skin in the game. if this route is taken, should that money be paid back to him once the company is profitable? my final question is how will potential future vc/angel investing work? if a vc later gets 50% of the company, i assume my equity will then be cut in half. if i have a minority share of the company to begin with, then i assume i will have zero say in this. right now, i'm thinking $5k + 50% equity.

thought experiment how would you save radioshack?	my answer to rebrand as a fast-food chain. yes, this would only 'save them' in name alone, but check out the vision they can use a bunch of their older stock, like vacuum tubes and old radios and such, and use those to theme the restaurant. they serve heart-clogging burgers from the 50s era, but named geeky names, as well perhaps as having futuristic meals . the staff can wear black glasses with tape on the nosepiece, and actual pocket-protectors. they could even do a tie-in with disneylands tomorrowland for kids meals. now that might be unique enough, and get enough media attention, and harken back to the past which we all want to remember as innocent, and yet allow them to sell the ultimate consumables food. that might stick around for another few decades. what is your crazy idea for how to resurrect radioshack for the present era.	rees-maxwell	/r/business/comments/2uyl3t/thought_experiment_how_would_you_save_radioshack/	11	1	0	0.56	1423203356.0
 is giving someone 40% equity of your company for 50k better than just getting a 50k bank loan? why?	to be specific, i had a disagreement with friends over whether it was a better deal to give a lender shark 40% of their company for 50k, or take out a 50k loan from a bank or other more typical source. i understand that in addition to the money the value of the shark is in their networking and distribution connections. i just want to know what kind of deal/rates a typical company that goes on the show could get from typical loans opposed to what they get on the show. would a smart person with faith in their product give 40% equity for 50k, or would a 50k loan be better? i don't know much about the going rates of business loans so i was hoping to get some input. thanks!

how exactly do businesses suffer, when their share value goes down?	i somehow feel a little bit dumb to ask this, but how do businesses suffer when their share goes down? lets assume, that the decrease in value of the shares, doesn't necessarily have to do with bad performance of the company, but is just occuring due to lack of trust of the market. the company itself holds most of the shares, which value goes down aswell, but the owner/management doesnt sell those anyways. so i understand, that if the value of the company goes down, the shareholders suffer, but the actual manager/owner has no intent of selling the business, so why should he care if the value goes down, aslong as the productivity, profit and value of assets remain the same?

why multi-level marketing companies aren't as bad as you thought	multi-level marketing companies have gotten a bad wrap over the years. we all know that one friend who used to be cool until he got involved with that pyramid scheme bullshit. now all he wants to do is pitch his business to you every time you see him. what an asshole. multi-level marketing companies suck. well, not so much. with a quality product and an emphasis on respect, multi-level marketing companies could become a very efficient way to sell legitimate products. the internet is connecting everyone everywhere through social media and the like. marketing and networking are becoming as easy as logging in, typing up a post, and hitting share. facebook's ad campaign feature allows you to find interested leads without having to bother all your friends and family. linkedin can connect you to people with similar business interests. twitter is basically a bulletin board all your friends can see. post about the opportunity, let the interested parties come to you. technology is making the multi-level marketing business model more and more favorable for everyone involved. it's relatively cheap, it's highly efficient, creates more jobs, gets products on the market quickly, and allows people freedom to work how they want, when they want. multi-level marketing isn't a bad business. it is, in reality, a highly effective and highly efficient way to sell a product. as long as the product is legitimate and the sales people treat their leads with respect and professionalism, multi-level marketing companies stand to do big things in this golden age of internet connectivity.		/r/business/comments/2vjxno/why_multilevel_marketing_companies_arent_as_bad/	5	0	0	0.38	1423674963.0
business owners of reddit before launching our new business, another opened doing the exact same thing that we had planned and is doing better than even i imagined. has this happened to any of you? how did you stay motivated?	i feel completely beat right now. we are months from launching and i feel my idea was completely ripped off. i have absolutely no connection with the people that launched the competitor and there is no way they could have known about us as we are only a 3 person team. their team consists of ex apple employees, people who have worked at ebay, and others that are far better on paper than any of us. i feel like giving up. has this happened to any of you? what did you do? were you able to succeed in the long run?	kxxstarr	/r/business/comments/2vlsx3/business_owners_of_reddit_before_launching_our/	7	1	0	0.55	1423705948.0

what is it called when you continue to build something, although you don't need it, to maintain experience and save money in the future? 	hey /r/business, i work at a shipyard which, of course, is almost a money pit industry in the sense that there is excessive waste and a low profit margin. i am often curious about how we can make money, and why some of the decisions that we make are made. the other day i read an article stating that, while the navy does not need more submarines or ships, we should continue to build them to maintain shipbuilding experience which will reduce costs when ships need to be built in the future. does it really save money to continue building submarines now that we don't need, rather than just ordering more when we need them? is there a name for this and maybe some examples of where this has happened before ? sorry if this is a little vague, it is somewhat difficult for me to describe this.	undaunting	/r/business/comments/2xlzk8/what_is_it_called_when_you_continue_to_build/	3	3	0	0.68	1425252431.0

dad used to be an entrepreneur, then suffered brain damage, leaving behind several businesses . i don't know what to do with them and need advice.	to elaborate on the title my dad used to be a busy, busy entrepreneur, and invested a lot of our money into a variety of businesses. then he had an episode of what has been called encephalitis, an embolism, a poisoning well, we don't know what it was, but it destroyed a part of my dad's brain. this was a few years ago now, and while he survived, he lost memory-related capability and generally suffered, as well as accumulated a lot of debt because what happened was so sudden and essentially destroyed his businesses . back then, i was a student and i didn't know how to help. now i'm a graduate, and i still don't know how to help but we're not doing great for money, especially after my dad also fought and beat cancer recently , and we still have debt. reason i'm explaining that is because i'd really appreciate the help, and i'm not at all familiar with business. we are eastern-european. my dad invested money into several businesses he'd like to sell now in order to retire 1 a cement/asbestos factory which also deals with drywall , 2 a cotton-refinery plant , and 3 plans, permits and research that were carried out for the purpose of building a hydro-electric station. over the years, there's been some interest from china and a few other asian countries, given the location of these factories and projects is close to the border with china. however, no deal has ever been struck. the first two projects are worth roughly 3-4 and 5 million usd respectively, and the third less so. i'm not looking for buyers on here or anything the information i presented there is just to give an idea of what there is, what scale i'm talking about. i've been told that in situations like these, when what is at stake is large industrial businesses, someone acts as a broker and gets a commission from selling projects but i don't know where to look for such a person. does one advertise for a broker? go to special companies for this? i've helped my dad with a few things like translating contracts and conversations with chinese clients before, and when i've had to contact them, it's been enormous trouble to make myself understood. i don't know the first thing about trying to sell businesses for millions of dollars. please any advise would be appreciated. this may sound like some weird, fraudulent melodrama, but this is what's happening and i just want to help my dad. if i'm posting this in the wrong subreddit, please tell me . thanks a lot!	caringbutuseless	/r/business/comments/2xou4a/dad_used_to_be_an_entrepreneur_then_suffered/	3	1	0	1.0	1425318792.0

why did safeway eliminate their loyalty cards?	i'm currently studying marketing, and trying to apply some of my knowledge. i've learned that from a company perspective, there are a lot of advantages to having a loyalty card program. you can track individual consumers and their purchases, and get some incredible data such as repeat purchases, average spend per visit, frequency of visit, the list goes on. surely this isn't the only way to learn about customers, but if the system is in place and it can provide great data, why change the program ? this data is not only valuable to the safeway box stores themselves, but it would also be extremely valuable to suppliers of safeway, to learn demographic information about those who buy their product, purchase frequency of individual customers, average spend per purchase, etc. my question is, what is the reasoning for safeway losing their loyalty cards? expensive maintenance? seems unlikely. this data could be very valuable to the firm and its suppliers; as an outsider who knows nothing about the actual dollars and sense, i find it hard to believe that the price of maintaining a such a system is more expensive than the value of the information that it could provide. i mean it's possible that it could be way too costly to maintain, but it just seems unlikely in my view. same thing with differentiation. i think loyalty cards can play a big role in actually making customers loyal. bringing your card provides discounts, versus going to another store where you would have to sign up for another card just to receive their discounts...i know it has kept me as a loyal customer. as a minimalist i had having a million cards, and i can honestly say saving an extra piece of plastic from my wallet has played a factor into choosing what store i go to. location is obviously the most important, but in travelling or whatever, whenever i had the choice i would choose safeway because i had a card there. also, now that the loyalty cards are gone, i personally find my spending habits much more regimented. in order to get the maximum fuel discount, i have to spend over $250.00. because of this, i now plan my meals and buy ~2 weeks worth of groceries . before this, i would make impulse purchases and visit the store much more frequently. obviously this is just me, and i may not behave like how most consumers do, but i know that i'm not the only person who would think this way. anyways, i'm just trying to learn, and i'm hoping you smart business people can provide me with some further insights. at the very least we can have an interesting conversation!	lipchuck	/r/business/comments/2xvwd6/why_did_safeway_eliminate_their_loyalty_cards/	26	18	0	0.81	1425453802.0

how necessary is it for my business to update to the new chip card compatible credit card terminals?	i am part-owner of a small bbq restaurant in a small town. we've had credit card companies contacting us for a while now insisting that it's absolutely necessary that we update our terminal to the new chip card and contactless compatible machines. they have used all sorts of scare tactics, such as claiming that we're not going to be able to accept our customers' payments if we don't update, that we'll be opening ourselves up to a whole world of fraud liability if we don't update, etc. i smell a rat. i sense a high-pressure sales tactic designed to make me panic and spend loads of money. my own research suggests that yes, after october, the liability for card fraud that occurs on nonchip terminals will shift away from card-issuing banks, which now bear the brunt of fraud costs, to the merchants. however, given the nature of my business and the small town that it's located in, i see this as very low-risk for us. can anyone confirm or deny that my impressions are correct? my other research suggests that we're not very likely to encounter a situation in which we're unable to accept a customer's payment. first of all, most cards for quite a while are going to be issued with both a magnetic stripe and a chip. second, even if a customer came in with a card that had no magnetic stripe, only the chip, i could simply manually type the card number into my machine to process the transaction. correct? any other advice or comments?	bwebb0017	/r/business/comments/2y9sgg/how_necessary_is_it_for_my_business_to_update_to/	28	9	0	0.69	1425760459.0

need advice on north american marketing for china factories	i was recently tasks to look for some new relationships in the north american market for a group of factories in china. the factories provide a wide array of products from jewelry, gem stones to plastic injection consumer products. i will not be acting as a broker but more or less an extension of the group in china residing in na. the group is willing to product goods at cost just to establish some long term relationship. all of their current clienteles are in the asia market. i was asked to start with the craft jewelry market with the goal of one day working with big chains like michael's. we are currently starting small, supplying custom silver and steel craft jewlery products for a couple small companies in michigan and ontario. however, sales are slow and we are having a hard time trying to get pass the gate keepers of many businesses. we did try print ads, google adwords, trade magazines and what have you with very poor conversion rate. just wondering if anyone have some good advice for us to grow a bit faster. any tips or advice would be much appreciated. thanks!	tsesamson	/r/business/comments/2yk641/need_advice_on_north_american_marketing_for_china/	3	1	0	0.6	1425997334.0

what minor will compliment an entrepreneurship major?	hey all, i'm heading to college this fall and i'm looking for some advice. some day i would like to my business, and to prepare myself for that process, i have chosen to major in entrepreneurship. i am having trouble choosing a minor due to two contradicting schools of thought. first, i understand that starting up a new venture is going to require a substantial starting investment . knowing this, should i minor in an area of study that will be useful in acquiring a job out of college so that i can save some capital before investing in a new business? for this, i was considering a minor in computer science because i'm a huge computer nerd; i also feel that this will be the most useful in acquiring a job out of college. the other school of thought is that i find a minor that will compliment my entrepreneurship major in the field of business; the added bonus here is the possibility of double dipping between classes. for example, with a minor in finance, i am versatile in the business sector and can possibly get a job in that field. what do you think is the better option?	o0Brilliance0o	/r/business/comments/2yqub2/what_minor_will_compliment_an_entrepreneurship/	4	3	0	1.0	1426123080.0

my supplier's ceo and top management wants to meet and how they can adopt my ecommerce business model and cut out the middle man ...	my wholesale supplier's ceo and top management wants to meet and how they can adopt my ecommerce business model and cut out the middle-man . as a middle-man myself, how do i handle this? some background i sell non-perishable groceries on various ecommerce channels as a business. the products i sell are sourced from several wholesale distributors. my business has been steadily growing and i expect to triple sales in the next few months as i have recently acquired some warehouse space and will be bringing on an independent contractor to help me increase output. the details just a few days ago i get a phone call from my sales rep . she tells me that she wants me to meet the ceo of the company and some of the top managers to help them with their entry into the direct to consumer business model. she goes on to explain that half the management wants to do grocery delivery and the other half wants to do online retail . now i have very little experience with grocery delivery other than the research that i have done that has taught me that it is a very difficult business model, requiring many challenges to be overcome. here is an interesting case study of one of the first online grocers, homegrocer	Strel0k	/r/business/comments/30ray4/my_suppliers_ceo_and_top_management_wants_to_meet/	12	8	0	0.91	1427677876.0

my mom bought a fro-yo restaurant, and she's in shambles. serious help needed.	in october of 2014 my emotionally unstable mom bought a frozen yogurt establishment with the prospects of hiring a manager and making money without doing anything. she is in bad debt now because the yogurt shop isn't making any money, and she's working harder than she's ever worked in her entire life. she comes home near crying every night, and it's tearing my family apart, so anybody who can offer a serious solution would be unbelievably appreciated. she can't keep doing what she's been doing, and she doesn't want anything to do with the yogurt shop. i can try to supply any information that would be needed to assess the situation. if there's a better place to ask this question, i would be grateful if someone could direct me. thank you.		/r/business/comments/30rsux/my_mom_bought_a_froyo_restaurant_and_shes_in/	210	208	0	0.9	1427687673.0
i'm involved in a bidding war to acquire my business. any advice?	fellow entrepreneurs, i own what is by far the most successful business in my niche. we have competitors but our nearest ones are for various reasons not for sale and everyone else is so far below us they barely count as competitors. this has resulted in a lot of interest from major corporations in purchasing my business. in the last week i've received one offer, and expect three more initial offers to be submitted within the next week. since these all came in basically at the same time i haven't informed any of the interested parties that i have other offers due to be submitted. however, my hope is that by doing so after receiving their initial offer it will prompt them to raise their number. but... while i've been in sale negotiations before, i've never managed a bidding war and could really use some advice. is informing that other offers exist after they make theirs, the best course? what's the best way to go about informing the buyers that there are other bidders? can i, or should i, reveal the dollar amount of the highest bid in order to give the others a chance to beat it? any advice would be hugely appreciated!

how do you deal with the frustration of seeing others take over the market?	i started my company 6 years ago. i work 60 to 70 hours a week and am doing well. built up from working at home with nothing to a small office with a small team. already had my bachelor degree and got my masters degree by working going to school in the evenings. a competing company just started over a year ago and has already surpassed me in terms of growth and revenue. the frustrating thing is not that they are doing much better than what i am doing. in fact that would be a motivation because it shows me that it is possible. but in this case they are growing because the founder is privileged. his family is very rich. his office in an amazing monumental building that he gets at cost price because his father owns it. he got his first major clients threw his uncle, who is managing partner at one of the biggest ad-agencies in the country. he has the right coaches, gets the best talent and the clients. he doesnt know much about the business and only works part-time. but has 2 managers under him that work very hard and are very knowledgeable. they basically run the company while he gets the attention. this is not only frustrating but also demotivating me. it's like playing against someone who cheats and i dont know how to deal with this.

r/business i need your advice! i'm buying furniture from brazil to import to the us - is it better to set negotiate prices on the us dollar or the local currency ?	$1 us dollar = $3.16 brazilian reais the brazilian economy is in a downward slope and so while it may be unbalanced and unpredictable, the tendency is for the local currency to continue to lose value or at the very least, stay at the level it is now for a while. the supplier quoted me the prices in dollars, however, should i insist that he quotes me the prices in the local currency? which would be more beneficial? although we haven't talked about payment arrangements, i could either wire him the money from the us straight to his business account or wire the money to my account in brazil and pay him from my brazilian account. i'm not sure if this has a huge impact on the overall transaction but any feedback is helpful.	heyyyilikeyou	/r/business/comments/314sz2/rbusiness_i_need_your_advice_im_buying_furniture/	2	2	0	0.67	1427934049.0

need advice for business situation	i am using a throwaway so my business is not attached to this post. i am a newer web design company and we are creating a member's only section for a local business. there is a contract in place and we have been meeting our milestones per the agreement. i received a phone call from a web design company an hour away from my town. they stated that the business owner has hired them to create a website for them. my client never informed me of this other company. my client is a franchise business and the original scope of the other company's work was supposed to be on the corporate website. turns out that the franchise's corporate office has clamped down on any alteration to franchise websites through the corporate domain. so now this other web design company is going to create a website for the franchise on the domain i was using for the member's only section. my contract with the franchise owner states that i am an independent contractor. this is the language in the contract > relationship of the parties > > independent contractor designer is an independent contractor. designer shall determine, in its sole discretion, the manner and means by which the services are accomplished. no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this agreement. neither party is authorized to act as agent or bind the other party except as expressly stated in this agreement. designer and the work product or deliverables prepared by designer shall not be deemed a work for hire as defined under copyright law. all rights granted to client are contractual in nature and are expressly defined by this agreement. > > design agents designer shall be allowed to use third parties as independent contractors in connection with the services . designer shall remain fully responsible for design agents compliance with this agreement. > > no exclusivity this agreement does not create an exclusive relationship between the parties. client is free to engage others to perform services of the same or similar nature to those provided by designer, and designer shall be entitled to offer and provide design services to others, solicit other clients and otherwise advertise the services offered by designer. we also are close to 50% away from the project deadline. what is the best course of action for this situation? the client hired another web design company instead of talking to us about it. i don't want to wall our project off because i don't want bad reviews but i also don't think i have to work with this other company either. i can create the members only section and the other company can just link to it. however, that isn't a very business friendly attitude.

a well-known restaurant chain is stealing tax. they do this to every single customer. what should i do?	hello people, i eat my lunchs from a known cafe/restaurant chain and they keep stealing my money by charging false tax amounts. they don't print receipts, they don't even enter the before tax amount. i believe they are stealing tax and my money by charging me tax. i believe they are not even supposed to charge me tax since their revenue comes from to-go orders, not eat-in customer. ------------------- -they are in a big building's food court. they do not have any seats. the food court has 6 tables for people and there is no indication those seats belong to food court or for eating. the tables are very close to the exit, and there is no indication the area is a food court. -zip code is 90015 and sales tax is %9.0. -chicken wrap is listed $8.05. -they charged me $9.25. the difference is $1.2 which is more than %15 which does not even exist anywhere in california. -they enter the amount manually with no tax calculation. straight $9.25. -they do not print receipts. and most likely the register is not on record mode. probably only calculation mode. -when i asked why it is $9.25, she told me it is the tax added final. --------------- i am pissed because they do it every single day. we are running a business very close to them and we pay our taxes no matter how much the sale's amount is. can you please tell me if i am wrong or not. if i am right, i will record what they are doing and post online. these kind of business places are ruining this country. thank you. ---- edit thank you for the responses. i will order the same item next monday and record the process. i will also ask for a receipt and see how she is going to react . op will deliver. edit2 for those telling me that it could be to-go fee, i ordered 3 wraps. i paid total of $27.75. to-go fees are per order, not per item. also, there is no such thing mentioned in that restaurant. $3.60 from only one order is absolutely insane. i can't imagine how much money they are pocketing in one day. and i am not calling local news or any media, i will find out what's going on and report it to city. let's just wait till monday and solve the mystery.		/r/business/comments/3267q8/a_wellknown_restaurant_chain_is_stealing_tax_they/	99	201	0	0.87	1428705502.0

warlord of old times in china employed not just generals to help lead armies, but also group of intellectuals, scientists, and philosophers who had no specific specialty but to help the warlord think and strategize in open ended ways. why do the super wealthy not do this nowadays?	take for example cao cao, the warlord who united the 3 kingdoms period of china into what would become china. he employed hundreds of generals to help lead his armies. he also employed dozens of philosophers whose main purpose was to know everything about philosophy, war, science, everything. and in making both military decisions and nonmilitary decisions, this congress fed him information, kind of like a unified brain. interestingly, the gao kao exam originally was meant to be an exam to find the smartest people in china, and make turn them into people who would sit in the congress to help whoever was the leader. now take this into modern times, and take elon musk for example. elon musk's different companies are analogous to his different wars that he is fighting, so his executives, engineers, etc for his different companies are analogous to his generals. but where is elon musk's congress? elon musk does an immense amount of reading. he has many friends who are very smart. but if there is one thing that very successful people always do, is that they need to outsource as much as possible. why is he still depending on only himself to read all the books and understand all the things when the value of his doing this could be greatly greatly amplified by starting an elon musk general congress llc which basically scouts the us for iq 160 people, make them read everything that elon reads, consider possibilities, form connections, discuss contingencies that musk doesn't have time to think about personally, and basically functions as a congress. that which has value, will certainly be valuable enough to pour some money into. in this case, it's generalized knowledge and time to think about open ended things. by spending so much time learning, musk is saying that this is valuable to him. so if it is valuable, then he can get more of it by having other people do it with him.		/r/business/comments/32n8j8/warlord_of_old_times_in_china_employed_not_just/	6	9	0	0.76	1429068594.0

what is the best investment opportunity in your local area?	i am not asking in what i should invest in, nor am i asking what the best investment opportunities are in general but rather in your neighborhood, town, region, city etc. for example where i live the gold mine is building apartment blocks since there is a huge influx of students and people migrating to my town hence driving the prices of housing drastically high and there is a huge profit margin for building and then reselling houses or apartment blocks. i'm in sarajevo, republic of bosnia. what's your story?		/r/business/comments/346ch3/what_is_the_best_investment_opportunity_in_your/	2	5	0	0.86	1430242335.0
what does it take to open a small gym?	hey guys i really need some help. my dad and i are thinking about possibly opening up a small gym in our suburbs. the idea is to have something catering specifically to weightlifters, so this gym would have 5 power racks, and a few deadlift platforms. now my dad has operated a gym for over 30 years, but this was back in russia and most of that was under soviet control, so yeah communism, not owning your own gym, etc. we are pretty serious about this but have absolutely no idea what it would take to get something like this rolling. questions i would love answered. 1 is this possible? 2 can we lease any type of space or does it have to be a retired gym? 3 is it possible to make a profit on a quarterly basis by only having 10-20 members? . 4 what type of insurance would we need? 5 what type of recurring monthly expenses go into leasing a space and operating this type of business? this would be in the suburbs of chicago. i'm sorry if all of this sounds stupid, i just need some ideas from people who have a clue! thanks in advance!

how can my dad direct more users towards his small business's website?	he's owned a small glass block company in a midwestern city for 18 years, and business has faltered the past year or two. he's tried advertising a few ways in a local print magazine and through google advertising clicks. both ways didn't get him any extra business. using google analytics, we can see that he's only had about 318 users in the past month, 145 of which were in the usa. since he owns a small business, he can only cater to local customers in our city, of which we've only had 9 users and a total of 11 sessions. what would you do in a situation like this? i was thinking of using usps's flier service and picking a few key neighborhoods and sending fliers that way. it would cost only a couple hundred dollars and even a single job would pay for the price of the fliers. i'm at a loss at the best way to advertise to a local market online, though. i can provide any further information about the situation or business. thanks!

how important and relevant is getting an mba if you already received a bba from a top school?	i've been hearing very conflicting views about this. half the people i talk to say an mba is pretty useless if you already got a top-notch bba education since you already can dive through financial statements to value stocks, are pretty aware of relevant corporate laws, know how to write a marketing plan, and other business skill-sets. i've heard an mba won't offer any additional education benefits and it's only worth going to if you want to expand your network. . --- but on the other hand, i have friends who are studying for the gmat because they think in the future, an mba will be the difference between being promoted to an executive or not. that the bba will be rendered pretty useless the older you get since bachelors degrees are already becoming the norm. --- what is your opinion?	andyetanotherkiwi	/r/business/comments/34um1g/how_important_and_relevant_is_getting_an_mba_if/	3	2	0	0.67	1430763489.0

i submitted this as a comment to a relevant taco bell complaint, but not sure where to put it now. anti-corporate mindset	simply looking for more insight on this, my comment didn't get any replies. op was complaining about how fast food workers often say how are you at the drive-thru and how its scripted by corporate . now, this comment might have not been an jab at corporate per se, but its the underlying tone i have an issue with. this anti-corporate mindset by much of the internet makes me upset, if we didn't have corporations then for example, many industries we rely on just wouldn't be where they are today, like technology. everything would be homemade with questionable quality control. and also, on most cases, a company got to nationwide corporate status because they were efficient and good at what they do, and imo that deserves praise. building a business is hard, my mother owns a small business and still struggles. here is the copy pasted comment i cannot stand this anti-corporate mentality. it just seems to be getting bigger and bigger, especially from internet communities like here and twitter. i honestly don't understand it... if you don't like that place, don't shop or eat there. and odds are, at least in my experience, everyone loves to complain about their bad experience shopping at walmart, target, eating at mcdonalds etc, and automatically target the corporation when its usually that location specifically that is bad, eg bad employees or something. can someone eli5 without being all pissy about it cause i noticed alot of people do.	baconsoupfordays	/r/business/comments/353qux/i_submitted_this_as_a_comment_to_a_relevant_taco/	2	1	0	0.6	1430947149.0

what core business skills are best complemented by language ability?	i've never considered a career in business. i'm good at languages, and i had planned on pursuing a career in foreign affairs through the department of state or dod, and to that end i earned a degree in international relations and i became a military linguist. my wife and i had a daughter who is disabled and requires expensive medical care, so now i'm having to shift my focus to a field with greater earning potential. i realize that companies generally don't hire employees whose only skill is language, irrespective of how many or how proficient. i thought /r/business might have some perspective on what skills, education and training might best be complemented by language skill, with a focus on long term earning potential and wealth building. on the ilr scale i test at a 3/3 level in persian-farsi and afghan dari, the maximum score on the lower level exam, and in the near future i'll be going through the military chinese course, after which i expect to test similarly in that language. i realize there is a limited market for persian, but its a skill i already possess, and it would be a waste of training to ignore it. thanks in advance for any advice. edited for link.		/r/business/comments/37mjgs/what_core_business_skills_are_best_complemented/	3	2	0	0.55	1432838813.0

how do i gain more knowledge at my job without it backfiring??? everyone around me is so damn busy!	i've been at my job for a little over a year as a an assistant staffing coordinator. i am the first to have this position at this small business. for the last 3 months or so, i've been getting less and less work since the turnover rate has declined, assignments lasting longer, and new procedures have been put in place by our client. i have no work to do at this point. i've offered my assistance to others, but the vast majority of work that is available, i am not qualified for, nor am i even privy to the information. i'm trying to avoid drawing too much attention to the fact that i have damn near no work at all. i've been organizing the same files for the last 2 weeks and i've done over 100 interviews in the last month without sending anyone to work, just to appear busy. only god knows how many phone calls i have made and files i dug through to acquire that many interviews. my supervisor does an exceptional job at looking out for my best interests , but has recently been swamped with work and so is everyone else. i feel that at this point, my position isn't needed and i'm only being kept around because a decent workload will randomly pop up and i'll take care of it. plus i've been told i am getting a promotion, but i'm not holding my breath on that since i've been given very little information regarding it. if anything, it sounds more like something my supervisor is pushing for, but became overzealous and told me about it before it was concrete. tl;dr sorry the post seems a bit scatter-brained. but basically, how do i go about learning more from my very busy supervisors without bringing too much attention to the fact that i have no work to do and without pestering them? i've been looking busy for about 3 months now. the jig will be up pretty damn soon.

how to handle equity division when starting a small business	i am starting a small business with some colleagues. we've been working together for a few years on a different project which has come to a close. we would now like to start a related business of our own. we don't have any ip issues to worry about, which is great. we will purely be drawing on non-patented lessons learned from our past project, which occurred at a public university. these are the main points under consideration for equity distribution we've each contributed different amounts to the past project which we're using as a jumping off point we have different levels of experience we will be working different amounts. some nearly full time, others very part-time some of the equity models on the table dole out initial equity relative to contributions to the work to-date . dole out initial equity equally as work is performed, reward contribution through additional equity. this seems like it'll be challenging to track, but does seem fair. we're not currently planning on pursuing venture capital, as we'd prefer to form a small business with the legs to carry us forward with career positions and creative freedom for the founders. any advice or links to resources would be very helpful!

how do businesses source their products?	i'm curious as to how stores and businesses source their products. specifically i was looking at this upc 039800062888, which is for energizer batteries. it sells at my local big lots for $13.95 and sells on amazon for 13.72 my question is, how does amazon and big lots source this product for a price that allows for a good margin? all options for wholesale on the first page of google are more expensive then amazon. obviously they don't use alibaba as alibaba sells generic products. so how do they do it?

how much would small businesses pay?	i'm about to open a company with the main purpose being computer and device maintenance, repair, and warranty. we will support all your office devices and if they are broken we will repair them or replace them. our main objective is to be an outsource company to replace computer technicians. many of our interested clients have less than 25 users, but they are growing. we also have had interest from companies closer to the 50 user mark. i really want to stick with a flat rate for all companies, and i think we can, but the question is, what is it? i'm thinking ~700-800 a month is reasonable. let me know what you think, and if my prices are outrageous or not.	shutupdan1	/r/business/comments/3a8zbl/how_much_would_small_businesses_pay/	2	1	0	0.67	1434601338.0
i am starting a coffee delivery business, and i would appreciate input on how i can offer the best possible service.	hello! i am starting a coffee delivery business in the richmond, va area. i am currently focusing on offering items from starbucks, with more options coming in the future. i will take orders daily, with a focus on making sure customers receive their orders exactly as they would have gotten them if theyd ordered from a store. i plan to take orders daily in the early morning, except when otherwise stated . my target demographic is anybody who does not have the time or means to pick up coffee shop items, or would simply prefer the delivery experience. i havent spoken with any starbucks managers to get their takes on it, but i imagine that they would not mind the extra business that i may bring in. with the new mobile ordering system theyre now implementing, my service must still be convenient enough to deserve to exist. i havent yet set a service fee, and i plan to offer coffee to businesses as a sort of trial for myself and customers to become familiar with the service, while spreading awareness. im looking to identify qualities that customers would prefer in this kind of service that would best cater to them and their needs , as well as business tactics and advice to execute this as smoothly and effectively as possible. any input would be greatly appreciated. dont hesitate to let me know what you think, whether im doing something wrong, or i should focus on a particular area of this idea.

who ever thought pensions were a good idea?	direct me if this is the wrong place for this. with the recent crisis in greece getting worse and many cities like detroit on the verge of bankruptcy, i've heard a lot about pensions getting cut. how did pensions even come about? it never made sense to me to keep paying someone after they retire. for those 20 years until the former employee dies you're basically just throwing money away. you'd have to hope that on average, each employee will generate enough profit to pay his pension at minimum in order to not lose money just byt hiring them. with talk of so many pension funds being so short on cash, i can only assume that this didn't pan out. how did such a scheme even get implemented in the first place? the only way it makes sense to me to give someone a pension is if they're the best of the best, and you want them to work for you that bad, or as a reward for years of hard work or great success . what's the idea behind pensions?	cata2k	/r/business/comments/3alpzz/who_ever_thought_pensions_were_a_good_idea/	8	0	0	0.43	1434892935.0

how to approach a business with a product idea?	i have been doing some research on how to sell an idea to business but...i am just not satisfied with range of answers i have been getting. but from what i narrowed down these are the typical answers i have been getting a.make a company sign a nda before any talks b.patent your idea then approach company c.have a lengthy and extensive paper trail as proof of being the ideas creator so the problem is the answers never really address the inherent issues surrounding them. whenever the issues are brought up there's no solution being told. and from what i gather nda isnt really a fool proof thing and even if a company signs and breaks it fighting a company with a retainer of lawyers is always a bad move. patenting the product idea is great...if you have money and know how to get through the patenting process . having a lengthy and extensive lengthy paper trail may help with proof of invention but really at the end of day its just as reliable as a the nda. so what approach is there for an average student like me with little to no money, no experience in said industry, and little to nothing in the ways of a physical build of the product for me to approach a company and get them to work with me. i know i have good presentation skills so i have decided to make a little package with the concept of my product idea with 3 different variations of it , in addition to a planned future iterations of it to show that the product is renewable and not just a one shot pony. but there won't be any actual sketch ups of the product just my efforts of a real real real rough sketch of 4 year olds drawing of the product. the problem is i want to be protected, i dont want a company to say no to my face then 6 months down the line release a very similar product and claim that its been in production for years or so fourth. i feel like my product is a very common sense solution to common problem in a rapidly growing niche market. i mention the market now because if i had the time then i would go to school for design then do this whole thing right but as of right now that isnt an option.i feel as the days pass this common sense product will be thought of some random executive and then they invent it and profit of it and then years later i see it in the store and say heyyy i thought of that first that's no fair! yea no. so guys is this a pipe dream or a realistic avenue? i only recently started cold emailing the big companies in my area so i cant gauge if this will work out or not. i hear certain people telling me companies will never take an actual product idea from someone due to the complicated legal mess of it . so my idea around this is taking a risk and showing a company my bare bones presentation and then asking the company to hire me on a contract to work with a design team to get them a more suitable and professional version of the physical product. tldr how do i realistically approach a company with a product idea with little to no experience and no means of a physical model.		/r/business/comments/3av23e/how_to_approach_a_business_with_a_product_idea/	8	8	0	0.73	1435086341.0

feeling discouraged at work. could use some advice/help.	hello all. i'm not sure this subreddit is the ideal place, so if it's not and you could re-direct me, i'd be happy to go there. i need some advice. after working with my hands for some time and then a stint of self-employment, i landed a professional job back in november. i don't have any credentials, but my experience and general nerdiness has given me something of a mind for business so initially i was able to contribute a lot and was seen as a bit of a golden boy. fast forward to now. i was hired in a clutch and that time has passed, as has my sense of usefulness. it will cycle back around in the winter, but in the meantime, i feel as though i'm spinning my wheels. i would like to be the golden boy for 12 months, not 6. maybe i'm not giving enough info, so i can elaborate if necessary, but in my opinion, we need to bring in more business. the trouble is, that's not really my department. i'm an account manager, so my work generally entails managing clients and vendor relationships and keeping everybody happy, not sales. i'm good with people, but not very good at selling. the next issue is that we are sort of ruining our relationships with our vendors because a big client we had is dragging its feet on paying us . it is so discouraging to speak to a vendor on the phone who hasn't been paid in 4 months so he can at least have his pound of flesh, i certainly don't have any extra energy to put into obtaining more clients . finally, i can't shake the feeling that this is all sort of indicative of the company being somewhat poorly run in the first place and i fear that this atmosphere could be my life for a long time to come. so i'm hoping you all could help me devise some sort of plan or maybe some books to read. this is a small business; i don't want to overstep my bounds, but i feel there is a real possibility that i could make some impact here. i know probably the simplest solution is to cut my losses, but since i don't have a lot of experience in this field, i'm concerned that i won't be able to find another job in it without some more education or experience. i am feeling very helpless, which is arguably the worst position to be in as an employee. rather than wallow in negativity, i would like to take a run at trying to make things better. so again, any advice would be helpful. sorry if i rambled. thanks!

what can this company do to expand international customer base whilst avoiding counterfeits?	please bear with me if this isn't the right subreddit to post this question in. let's start with an example scenario i'm a customer of this company that sells a line of handbags which are very popular and favoured internationally. for a while, profit is booming, lots of people buying them and are happy. after a while, counterfeit handbags start to pop up in the market where some customers who prefer a cheaper alternative steer towards, which leads the company to limit the places and means of selling them international/to international customers in fear that people who obtain them might increase the fake handbag manufacturing. in other words, this company limits sales to people local to the country of origin only. this also includes not allowing 'foreign' customers who have no proof of citizenship/address in country to purchase either. so for the international customer, they're left with no options at all. think online shopping? no. visiting the country and purchasing? no. i'm aware this is a little detailed but i'm basing this on an existing company's behaviour and while they have nothing to do with handbags, i'm using it as an example to better understand how they're operating. my question is, is this type of behaviour justifiable in a business and entrepreneurial perspective? isn't a business supposed to cater to those who are willing to purchase? i thought that was a given, and its getting more ridiculous. how can this company avoid counterfeits of their products without upsetting their international consumers? i'm not a business student or anything like that, so please eli5 or like.. 16 lol. cheers!	catsarebetterthanppl	/r/business/comments/3dar00/what_can_this_company_do_to_expand_international/	3	20	0	0.87	1436906466.0
need a little advice, business-wise.	i apologize if this is long. my friend has a food-based business in the american southeast. it's in the beginning stages but i think it has a lot of potential. i'm an old friend in canada with a marketing background. basically he started from nothing and he have built into into something. i've been more than happy to help get him off the ground as far as logo, positioning, collateral materials, and presentation decks to take to a variety of retailers. of which we now have 12-15 or so and more to come. basically, he created the steak and i've created the sizzle. we're almost at the point where we're ready to bring in outside investors to really ramp this thing up. here's the thing, i haven't taken a dime for my work, which i've been at for about a year now. he wants to retain 51% of the business and we've agreed to carve out 5% for me and my services thus far and continuing forward. what i need advice on is how do i maintain that 5% in the face of a capital infusion? will i be forced to invest money in the business to avoid being diluted? not sure how proceed but i want to cover my ass. i know my business otherwise but when it comes to numbers and structure i'm a little lost.

psychologically speaking, why does sponsorship marketing work?	every time i see something like a sports game with loads of sponsor signs lining the stadium or a team with sponsors all over the uniforms i just become confused. i do not understand why these types of marketing are effective or if they are. from the perspective of someone like me, someone who engages with money and capitalism as minimally as possible due to moral objections, it has no effect. but clearly based on the amount of money invested into these types of marketing they work. i just don't understand why looking at a logo can make someone want to buy something from whoever owns that logo. the is because i wasn't sure what to call it.

mildly complicated question about how charities are chosen for companies to donate to 	not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask, but here i am. this is the best way i can set up this question. company x owns companies y, z, and q. company y supports charity a. did company x have anything to do with y choosing charity a? would supporting companies z and q have any effect on y? if company x is european and y is american , does this change how that works? i can give specific companies that i am questioning, but if there's a general answer, going into specifics wouldn't be necessary.	bandnerd218	/r/business/comments/3el32n/mildly_complicated_question_about_how_charities/	2	7	0	1.0	1437851209.0

question how to handle new hires getting higher compensation?	i've been with a software consulting company for about 15 months now, i've been progressing steadily and gaining more responsibility, including a new hire that one other individual and i delegate tasks to. i was recently assessed for a raise, to which i received a 10% raise, bringing my salary from $70k annual to $77k annual. i recently just found out that the company reviewed their policy for new hires, so all new hires including my subordinate are all starting at $80k annual. i was happy with my salary until yesterday when i found out this information. it appears that the company values their new hires more than they value me. i am in-fact training my subordinate on how to do my job, when he is earning more than i! when it comes to skills, i have more seniority, more business and more technical experience. the boss i know somewhat personally, but he is at a completely different site and really is never available to talk over the phone. in a recent team meeting, he mentioned that any issues occurring with salary adjustments should be emailed to him, and i'm hoping to draft up that email tonight and send it in the morning. my big worry, as has been brought up by a coworker is that he will try to deflect the question to who told me their salary in an attempt to skirt my inquiry. i found out simply through other new hires not realizing that they are starting at a higher rate than i. what do i say in an email? i don't want to make myself out as a victim, but i don't want to give an ultimatum either. this really isn't the job for me in the long run, but i don't want to feel forced to get a new job immediately. tl;dr looking for advice on what to say in an email to my boss, who is starting new hires at a salary higher than my own, and i'm their supervisor.	shoostrings	/r/business/comments/3gnebl/question_how_to_handle_new_hires_getting_higher/	11	5	0	0.86	1439331753.0
how can i get rid of an overwhelming amount of overstock at some sort of a profit?	i own a flea market, and over the last 3 years i have accumulated more stuff than i can even mentally handle. the concept of of my store is that i rent out booths and make my money through rent from my vendors and from a percentage of sales. the empty booths i fill with my own merchandise until i'm able to rent the spaces out. now i'm down to only a few booths left to rent out , which i need to rent out to be able to start to profit from my business. but i also need to sell my own stuff to be able to make extra cash. so i have a dilemma. the stuff i have is mostly knick nacks, or $1-$5 items. candlesticks, ceramic dishes, random housewares, framed picture prints, board games, just a mess of random stuff that doesnt even really look good displayed in the store. i've looked into having an auction, but it's not worth what i would end up making off of it. i cannot just donate everything to goodwill, because even though it would be cleared out, i would literally be losing money. is there some way to just sell it in bulk? or can the awesome reddit community help me figure out a creative way to get rid of it quick in a profitable way? some pictures included as examples, but i have 3 storage units full of stuff like this that needs gone! example 1 2	NUMBerONEisFIRST	/r/business/comments/3gnrzz/how_can_i_get_rid_of_an_overwhelming_amount_of/	6	14	0	0.77	1439337929.0

business partner wants my source code, what should i do?	i went into business with this guy when he found my facebook page. he was looking for someone to develop a point of sale system for him and i took the job. with regard to risk management, i managed to get a partnership agreement in place so now we're business partners. that partnership agreement also stipulates that i own the intellectual property that is developed for this project. i've had the source code in dropbox for a while now as a backup and my business partner now wants a link to access it via this backup. i have a single problem with this in that if he has unrestricted access to the source code, there's nothing to stop him from taking it and disappearing and leaving me with nothing. while i trust the man and don't actually think he'll take it and run, it would be grossly negligent and naive of me to not consider my risk at this point. basically, keeping the code out of his hands is my smoking gun. if he doesn't pay me as per our agreement, i withhold it until i receive payment. so my questions are these 1. what should i do with regard to sharing the source code with my partner? 2. what steps can i take to ensure that personnel he hires to assist with the development of the software don't furnish him with the source code or steal it themselves? it's all well and good having agreements in place, but dishonest people don't care about non-disclosure agreements and stuff so what can i do here to protect my interests?	ortund	/r/business/comments/3ihal7/business_partner_wants_my_source_code_what_should/	4	1	0	1.0	1440604572.0

advice on eliminating position and keeping employee	my company will be cutting a position at our office and encorporating it into our manufacturing plant within the next couple of months. there is only one employee in that position right now. she has been loyal to the company, working nights and weekends when she wasn't asked or required to do so, but she very difficult to work with and is extremely defensive about constructive criticism. i feel like she could be capable at more of a back up position and running estimating for our company...however, i seem to be the only executive who thinks this. her current position pays a lot more than the back up would, so she would tale quite a pay cut. is this ethical and something that actually occurs in other companies? we are indiana so if we end up just letting her go because her position is phased we should be okay legally. i just feel like getting rid of her when she has all of the knowledge from our company would be such a waste. there is definitely room for us to have her as a back up. just not at the same salary.	kuunamatata	/r/business/comments/3j391g/advice_on_eliminating_position_and_keeping/	2	2	0	0.75	1441031997.0

part complaint / part solicitation for advice	background this isn't a plug for either business but this is necessary background. i own an investment advisory business and have recently started a side business on weekends sending out comics. the issue for the investment business, i am fee-only. this means i have a higher legal standard than edward jones, hilliard lyons, etc. thus, i charge a direct fee and am not allowed to make commissions from mutual fund and annuity companies. yet, these firms really have it easier because all of their fees are more expensive, but totally hidden. meanwhile, i am legally required to send my clients a quarterly invoice that details what they paid in dollars for my investment advice. so, i am making significant headway in this but i thought a comic book business during weekends would be a nice way to distract myself from the unethical business practices i see in investments while giving me new ideas for my investment business. my comic service would be very similar to a service called comic bento. comic bento is a monthly graphic novel subscription box. i started to notice that all of the reviews for comic bento were glowing and i got suspicious. especially when people received crap titles and complimented the selection unfailingly. turns out, i was right. comic bento pays reviewers if a viewer clicks on the reviewer's link and signs up. so, obviously, this is another case where an unethical business practice provides them a huge advantage. i don't want this to sound like sour grapes and i definitely don't begrudge success. my question is a general one how can i level the playing field while maintaining absolute integrity? can it be done or do i have to live with a worse economic outlook?	mi27ke85	/r/business/comments/3kv9ht/part_complaint_part_solicitation_for_advice/	3	4	0	0.76	1442203429.0

 ethic to let to go right now?	our company has decided to move forward on eliminating a position in our office and incorporating it into a couple other positions in our manufacturing plant. the employee has been here for about 3 years and has been dedicated to her job . unfortunately, there is not another position that she could move in to long term after she has been let go . i am the person who will be letting her go. here is my dilemma -- 2 weeks ago this was supposed to happen, but we got a huge order from a big customer that is worth around 1/10th of our annual goal for this year. it was completely and 100% unexpected. immediately i made it known to the company and it was taken as a very serious order. for the last week she has been working over time to help get it moving and today she has gotten it finished. my plan was to wait until after this was done to tell her about our decision to eliminate the position. i understand that this is rather sleazy of me to do given that it was right after the huge order came through. the problem is that the position needs to be eliminated now so we move forward with integrating this with the other jobs. it is either going to happen now, or a week from now. the only difference is that we would be a week behind on getting things working. prior to this decision being made i had started developing a new program to combine several of our computer programs together and tie them in with our estimating of order requests from customers to make it go more smoothly and quicker. my idea was to have this woman being laid off continue to stay on board for 3 more months here while helping me work on this. in the mean time i will be extremely flexible with her getting job interviews during work days, etc and i will be more than happy to be on her resume as someone to contact. i want to make sure her departure from here is as smooth as possible. she will receive the same pay she has been for these 3 months. given all of the information above, am i being a bad and unethical manager?	kuunamatata	/r/business/comments/3lbie3/need_advice_ethic_to_let_to_go_right_now/	2	2	0	0.67	1442507573.0

eoq - why the rush?	i work for a company that produces big data storage and server arrays, as well as a number of other appliances and converged solutions. my place in the company is in the manufacturing/distribution center where we assemble the systems together and configure them before they are shipped off to the customer. for the five years that i have been working there, and for many years before that according to several folks who have been with the company for much longer than i, the business cycle has gone as follows. month one and two of a quarter yield at best a steady, sometimes slow stream of orders which are on the plate to transact. sometimes things pick up a little more with a burst here and there, but on the whole the work is easily handled. for the end of quarter month though, all hell breaks loose and a massive surge of orders buries everyone under a mountain of work. overtime is the normal, expected course of action for every eoq and seems almost to be designed into the business model. it isn't uncommon for my department to spend an entire month working 10-12 hour days, with saturdays and sundays always in play depending on order volume. for a long time the only reason i had heard as to why this happens was due to sales reps giving discounts to make their numbers at the end of a quarter, and that repeat customers had caught onto this and would deliberately wait until a time frame where they would be likely to benefit from such a discount. to an extent i can see that happening, but not so much that it makes every quarter so lop-sided. it also doesn't make a lot of sense for a company to do most of its business through offering discounts. around a year ago i heard that this was no longer happening, but i really don't know how much it ever happened to begin with or how much it really effected the quarter end situation. earlier this year one of the higher-ups in the company made his usual post-eoq rush speech and mentioned that a number of people had been asking him about this very topic. he said that there are some factors involved which make the whole start to finish order process timeline difficult to predict, such as supply issues , and the fact that a particular deal may take several months to a year to complete based on all of the sales, technical consulting, regulations, and other factors involved. i understand all of that, and i see how it plays into the order process. then he said something that took me by surprise. he said ultimately, we don't know why the quarter end happens the way it does. not even for a second could i believe that a global, multi-billion dollar company could have a business cycle wherein the details and inner workings are a mystery to the people steering the ship. i see how many factors will contribute to a fluctuation of order volume since the product being sold isn't cheeseburgers and pizza, and it isn't a typical storefront style business. i could see how we would have slower times and busier times, but by that logic they should happen more randomly instead of exactly the same way over and over again. it's almost as if for two months the people upstream who are scouting sales opportunities and submitting the quotes into the order processing system are on vacation or something, then all of a sudden they realize 'oh shit! we have to make our numbers! push through as many orders as possible!!!' and i know this surely can't be the case, but i don't know what else to think since nothing ever changes from quarter end to quarter end we have something in the neighborhood of 60-80% of our numbers for the whole quarter to make up by the time we reach the final third of it, and we end up doing 40-60% of that in the last 1-2 weeks. obviously the company wants to make numbers, but i'd really like to know why it happens in such a mind-boggling way at this company, so if anyone can shed some light here i would greatly appreciate it. thanks!

how growth hackers see growth differently	growth hackers are a brand of marketing professionals that are solely driven by finding new, unexplored and unconventional ways to target their customers , growth hackers are there to follow a different path one forged by the customer. a growth hackers job is to study these patterns, find holes within the system as well as pinpoint friction in customer behavior that inhibit growth. growth hackers dont act like traditional marketers in the sense that they revolve around growth as justification for most if not all of their marketing decisions. this naturally places growth hackers at odds with various business structures. heres how growth hackers differ from their traditional counterparts --------------------- they arent afraid to experiment when we think of company resources, we imagine staffing, materials and equipment. corporate structures and management styles rarely make it to the mix. large corporations by default have a set of hierarchies that must be involved in the decision making process. as a result, they pass down a strict set of rules to their marketers and it becomes clear that a growth hacker will not be able to quickly implement a desired approach in accomplishing that same goal. stewart butterfield, the co-founder of slack used a hypothetical saddle riding company with a loosely defined product and market to . butterfield didnt let his product and market constrain him, just the opposite he altered them to resonate with his customers. instead of selling the tool which people didnt quite understand the need for he was able to sell the experience of productive teams and happy workplaces. or as in the example above, selling the experience of horseback riding instead of the physical object the saddle. --------------------- time isnt on their side startups are constrained by time to validate their product and are more open to unconventional ways to gain access to their user base. the growth hacker shares this line of thinking. since no business is exactly alike, growth hackers are free to apply unproven strategies or combine new and previously used methods to reach their goals. when basecamp tried to attract new users they were able to experiment early on by advertising many different products to the same user base. basecamp knew it was impossible to develop their entire product line, so by leveraging one user base for many products they greatly compressed their time to market. although somewhat obvious, this strategy is underutilized. in basecamps example, it allowed the company to quickly leverage their user base for beta testing before committing all of their resources on one tool. --------------------- theyre about being scalable the saas software market is growing 5 times faster than the traditional software market. growth hackers find themselves most valued in companies that are more interested in growth above all else. the saas market is ideal for a growth hacker, because unlimited scalability opens up a lot of metrics that a traditional marketer may not think of. consider that a saas business needs to not only think about increasing sales and signups, but also maintain an engaged user base to stay profitable. lincoln murphy, a saas marketing specialist, defines customer engagement much differently than an active user > engagement is when your customer is realizing value from your saas. instead of thinking about engagement as a product issue, you can see that it is actually a customer issue. murphy demonstrates that a user can be actively using a saas product but not necessarily be engaged. that means the user may be performing all the correct actions such as logging in numerous times and actively using the software during the trial period. separately these actions may be interpreted as growth, but combined they do nothing for realizing any value for that customer which is what engagement is. how can you tell if your customer isnt engaged? because the customer left after the trial was up. better get a growth hacker to look into that. --------------------- theyre not afraid of the unknown were always scared of the unknown, but a good growth hackers got steadfast belief in the power of numbers and data. yes, theres a lot of data out there but thats what makes undiscovered data so interesting to the growth hacker. for example, udemy realized that some users are more valuable than others precisely those that score higher on their nps or net promoter score. it drastically changed which users udemy decided to engage with the most. another metric that doesnt get much attention is monthly active users. while most companies follow the revenue trail, keeping track of monthly active users can uncover churn rates, friction in onboarding, or opportunities for upselling. --------------------- there are no constraints when it comes to growth! when businesses face a spike in demand we are always constrained by lack of staff, resources or time. for example, a companys reluctance to hire additional representatives during a new product launch may drive a number of customers to shop elsewhere. a good manager would make cuts elsewhere since taking a gamble on customer service is more detrimental to business growth than most other tactics imaginable. however, there is a way out a growth hacker is an envelope-pushing, product-focused marketer thats only judged by his or her results. a growth hacker will invariably be mired by constraints in all but one thing growth. do you want to limit growth? of course not. so you must practice and constantly change how you approach the problem. your tactics must change as the market changes from underneath your feet. try to take a long hard look at what works and doesnt for your business, while keeping in mind what your customers want to see. and always remember there are no constraints when it comes to growth. --------------------- to see this post in the original form with the image, click here	vitaliyv	/r/business/comments/3ps7ub/how_growth_hackers_see_growth_differently/	3	3	0	0.67	1445527646.0
how do you monetise an audience you have grown?	hello, my name is cristina and i am part of startup that creates web design products . i am not here to advertise the startup, but to ask for advice from people that may know more about the subject. we have currently have around 50.000 users that have registered, out of which around 600 are paying. our strategy up-to-date has been focused on growth. we have released a series of free products in order to attract more traffic and users. we then chose the best performing freebies and created paid versions for them. this has worked pretty well for us so far, but we need to find a way to increase out conversion rate in order to become profitable. if you have any advice, idea or have seen some interesting campaign in the field of web development tools, please let me know. if you need more details, ask me and i'll share them. thank you!	conacelelena	/r/business/comments/3pwevv/how_do_you_monetise_an_audience_you_have_grown/	3	4	0	0.67	1445603979.0
whale investor wants to take 51% of my startup, need advice.	hello reddit, i know there are a lot of experienced people so i decided to ask here. i am a founder of this start up currently valued at 10m + . company is based in north america but delivers work for middle east. we are going to start our first round of funding seeking 2 million dollars to expand. we were contacted by one of the richest people in dubai. they proposed that we will scale the business significantly as we were looking for different kind of expansion my question is as i don't want to be too long they want 51% and they will send an offer in 10 days. people scared me as they told me that they can fire me with majority and lock my shares as they wont have value. if they invested for example for 10 million so they can get majority will that money go to my pocket or the company. this investor wants to go into the market and i am worried they will go with one of our competitors. i was told going with investors of that size are pretty scary to work with. i am a young entrepreneur so i have never approached something like this, any advice would help	Shark2092	/r/business/comments/3q25s4/whale_investor_wants_to_take_51_of_my_startup/	11	6	0	0.75	1445712186.0

question about when to divide equity in a new startup	a little backstory a few months ago i joined a niche video production company a friend and his friend co founded. before i joined they were producing a few pieces of content a month more as a hobby. when i joined i helped turn it into a more business direction and we've been producing multiple pieces of content a week, without my contribution this wouldn't have happened. looking ahead we are hoping to turn this into a niche media company and have received a lot of great press from some reputable news sources. between the three of us myself and friend a do roughly 40% each of the work with friend b doing about 20%. i have brought up the equity topic saying that this is something that we have to discuss at some point but neither want to talk about it since we haven't monetized this business yet. i want to protect myself because i am putting in a serious amount of work outside of my full time job. i don't know whether i should push the subject or wait till a later date when things are more figured out with roles and amount of work each has contributed. any advice would be helpful this is the first time i have tried to get a company started and am still trying to figure it out thanks	delriomotel	/r/business/comments/3qwc1j/question_about_when_to_divide_equity_in_a_new/	3	7	0	0.89	1446243582.0

how do i go about selling my business with zero assets and zero liabilities?	hi there. i own a small business that exports a basic commodity product from india to us, uk etc. . the business itself does quite well with a turnover of $1 million a year & a gross profit of 28% & net profit after tax of 20% . the yearly turnover is quite stable. there are zero liabilities as well as zero assets. the only asset i want to sell is my relationship with these clients and hence my order book. i am trying to sell my turnover to other manufacturers in the industry who would be happy to have a steady cashflow of 1 million dollars and i would spend 6 months with the handover of clients, systems etc. my questions are the following 1. how should i valuate this business assuming the turnover will be stable in the coming years. is there a logic or mathematics that's standard for such a sale? 2. as it is a traditional commodity product, most people i have approached are reluctant to give me money upfront for a future income that's not predictable. what steps can i take to assure the investor that the clients will continue placing orders with them? 3. in my opinion a fair value would be 2 years net profit upfront . i would also spend 6 months training their team and doing the handover of processes and systems. whats your opinion on this? thanks for helping out with this! edit thanks again. i m getting pm's suggesting i'd rather stick to a percentage off the profits periodically. while that's arguably the best option here, i have other interests. my new business venture requires an initial capital of about $250k and that's one of my main reasons for selling this business.	sick_cycle_carousel	/r/business/comments/3t0e7e/how_do_i_go_about_selling_my_business_with_zero/	38	42	0	0.87	1447673354.0

how to drum up business?	hey there i run a developer company a rundown of us - we do all kinds of things - websites ,apps hardware software - and we are good at it - to me i think we are better and are using the most up to date stuff compared to 95% of the other website/devlopers companies out there. some of are sites are truly good and we take care in our work. what i see - i look at peoples sites and im told they spent 15000 on this site i could of built it myself in about a day and there was loads of shoddy work with it like stretched images no animation etc. i.e for a project where someone had 15000 to spend on a site they would get so much more. it would be pixel perfect and i mean that literally, every customer we have had so far has been truly happy with the work we have done for them they always get super excited about how great their site looks. so at this point we have been running nearly a year now but we are really struggling to find new clients - how do the rest of you do it - in tech companies or others? i have been cold calling but i find that unless people know you they dont want to give you the time of day and i just see all of these companies that will lose customers in the years to come because they dont bother updating their site to mobile ready 50%+ users are on phones or tablets now and the sites aren't ready for them - the competitors that do upgrade will be much better off - how do i get clients or potential clients to see that?

i have someone who is constantly trying to push me into business assets. how would you respond?	there is a guy that i met back during the summer, and he's friendly and outgoing. so one day he decided to invite me to a business conference; the people were very friendly, and the speeches used to achieve financial success were inspiring. however, i realized this was an amway scam when people wanted me to write down the phones numbers and names of my friends so that they could immediately give them. of course, i declined. i like to give people chances, so i still talk with the guy who invited me to the conference. however, the problem is that he keeps trying to push me into business assets. the past two times we went out to breakfast, it's all he talks about, and i can never catch a break. he asks if he can talk to my mom and my friends about his business financial job and give them a call. i say no thanks and he keeps trying to push me and ask me questions like, why do you feel like they wouldn't appreciate the call , and why do you go to bed at 12 00 when you should be going to bed earlier to prepare for business? he's a nice guy, but i can never catch a break with him. i've even tried shifting topics before and setting him straight, but it's useless. this isn't about someone asking me the hard questions; it's about someone being overbearing.	pillowman205	/r/business/comments/3tlt97/i_have_someone_who_is_constantly_trying_to_push/	7	1	0	0.6	1448049208.0

need help with my family business	hey guys, im not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this, but according to the sidebar it should be the correct place. basically my family has run jewelry manufacturing and wholesale for 38 years now, we have grown and expanded from ground up. the business is strictly in downtown la jewelry district where we wholesale to retail shops who sell our product. now my father is getting old and i have no experience in this business and im scared we would have to sell it or shut it down which hurts me because of all the hard work thats been put into building it. i have my own skills with the internet and web design and all that, and i want to figure out a way to expand this business and bring it into the web. basically i want to expand out of downtown la. i have already created a website back in the past and unfortunately that failed, i couldnt get people on to the site nor was i able to get people to trust us enough to drop over a grand on jewelry. do you guys have any links or tips for me to get a better understanding of how i can accomplish this? if this is the wrong subreddit please let me know where would be a better place to post this.

what to do about a client who expects me to work for free?	i've had this client since february this year. i manage his website for him which means hosting, content updates, database maintenance, etc and while he's very good generally about paying regularly, he's not very good at understand what work is billable and what isn't, despite the fact that i've explained it to him at least a dozen times. because of this he very regularly sends me emails requesting things like > please change x sentence on y page to z often he'll send me requests like this with a few such changes included. now, how i work is that new content updates are billable. i charge by the hour or part thereof so even if the work takes me 5 minutes, i charge for an hour. corrections to my own errors are not billable; that i'll do for free. the annoying thing is that this client - and he's the only client who does this - seems to expect me to work for free. he'll text me on my personal cell number requesting changes, or he'll email 2 hours worth of work asking if i'll just help him out with these changes and then he'll text me to let me know that he's emailed me and then to top it off, he'll call me as well to ask if i got his emails and to discuss their substance for 15 minutes. when i then tell him yes i got the emails and i can do the work, but i'll have to charge you for it because i can't work for free then he says okay well then don't worry about it . so not only has he wasted my time in sending me emails and texts to read, but he's also now wasted my time bending my ear about these changes that he now doesn't want me to do because he has to pay for it. can i just outright tell him listen, it seems like you're expecting me to work for free and i just can't do that. ?	ortund	/r/business/comments/3u728u/what_to_do_about_a_client_who_expects_me_to_work/	26	15	0	0.77	1448442717.0

why do people keep importing from china even though mexico is now cheaper?	now i know that china still produces a lot of cheap products, but recently it seems like more and more mexican products are starting to become cheaper. for example, these mushroom glass ornaments the 12 peso cost if i ordered 3000, leaves each one at about $0.73 usd. i quoted many on alibaba exactly like this one, and the cheapest quote i got for the same quantity was $0.95 usd per unit. i have done this comparison with a lot of other products, and about 50% of the time the mexican manufacturer has a lower price. with that said, why do americans keep on importing everything from china, instead of looking next door where it may be cheaper, and quite considerably if you take the shipping into account. this especially hold true for small & medium businesses importing smaller amounts. what do you guys think?	pquinter91	/r/business/comments/3umqd0/why_do_people_keep_importing_from_china_even/	5	22	0	0.93	1448745414.0

need some advice on how to proceed with a business partnership.	we are two individuals who just started a web agency. we are the core two founders. we have complementary digital skills that combined makes for a really good team and can pretty much tackle anything. the only thing we lack in experience are the business development/client services end of things. so we met this guy who has those skill sets, he has an mba and has skills in operations and hr. we think he is a good fit for our needs. we kicked the tires together, spent some time to see how we'd work together and it's all good. we think it'd be beneficial to have a business development/client services guy to bring work into our new agency. the issue is we're not sure how to compensate him and we're not sure if 1 hiring full time is necessary at this point and 2 making him a partner is a wise business decision. since we met him at the start of founding our company do we make him a partner too with equity? or do we hire him as a consultant and he gets paid by commission via the business he brings in? some advice would be most appreciated! 	eleniel82	/r/business/comments/3v103t/need_some_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_a/	2	3	0	0.81	1448993738.0

how have you handled foreign exchange deposits?	my business is steadily expanding more into international sales. i lower the frictional costs of doing business with my company by having customers pay in their home country currency instead of usd. however, this means i have to get smarter about my foreign exchange deposits or lose out significant sums to my bank as the sales increase in the future. at the moment, i just pad my prices by 5% to cover the 4.2% bank of america charges me by converting at a premium off of the xe.com-quoted mid-market rate. i'd like to lower that. i don't make enough from international sales yet to justify parking the funds offshore and using them to fund further international activities; the attorney and tax preparation fees alone for setting up in the different locales would probably take more than 5%. so for the time being i would like to repatriate the funds, but i'm open to ideas of leaving the funds offshore. i'm keeping an eye on transferwise, but they don't cover all the currencies i deposit . if anyone else here deals with deposits in a set of different currencies, how do you manage the currency exchange aspect?	yourapostasy	/r/business/comments/3y49b1/how_have_you_handled_foreign_exchange_deposits/	3	2	0	1.0	1450990984.0

potential employer asked me to make an offer letter. not sure how to respond.	quick background on my situation. i've been working for this small community bank for ~ 3months as a temporary, account manager. my contract ends in ~ 3-4 weeks. yesterday my supervisor, ask if i like it at the bank and if i would like to be a full time employee. i tell her yes i would, and she tells me, they would love to hire me. i asked about the benefits, and vacation. everything was okay in that area. when it came time to talk salary & commission payouts. i was asked to put in writing what i was expecting / wanting. i tried to get a feel for the typical pay of the position, by asking what was the cap? her response was there is no salary cap for your position. i've asked a few mentors, a few friends what could this mean or how i should go about writing the letter. i'm a 23 year old. no college degree, with 3 years of personal & commercial banking experience with one of the largest banks in the usa. i handled accounts that revenue between $50k-1.5mil commercial & personal. i was also a finance manager of a car dealership for 6 months prior to taking this job. all the regular customers love me, all the other employees really enjoy my presence and hope that i stay. they have had 4 people in 2015 come in and leave because of different reasons, ranging from not being able to accurately do the job, for having to do to much work, and for not being able to take constructive criticism well. i've come in and asked for more projects to over see, asked for more responsibility, and have asked to add more duties to my job. example; i've asked if i become full time, if i can go out during the day and find new business account clients, while maintaining my current job duties. my closing question to you r/business.. how do i handle writing a letter of this caliber to my potential future employer?

how can i help encourage a client to fly me in business class?	i have an assignment in nepal next month. client is finalizing the schedule and will be booking my travel accommodations this week. i usually fly domestic and have elite status with aa, 99% of the time i get complimentary business or 1st class upgrades, priority bags, free oversized, etc. so i never request it. however on this trip ill be flying outside of my airline network. since i travel with quite a bit of gear, it's not uncommon for me to have to spend & expense $1000-$1500 in baggage fee's alone unless i'm in business or first. this added expense falls a few hundred dollars short of a business class ticket. i don't want them to think of me as a diva or needy but for my line of work the benefits justify splurging on the better fare class. im not the best with words, so i was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to articulate or word a short pitch to get them to fly me in business class. thanks!		/r/business/comments/40iv7i/how_can_i_help_encourage_a_client_to_fly_me_in/	11	1	0	0.67	1452546086.0

help i'm in a partnership being taken advantage of. help me please	as the title says i have recently opened my own business in a partnership. but my partner is the majority and keeps changing things around on me and keeping me in the dark. let's say i spent $10,000 and he was the majority. he asked what % ownership do you feel entitled since i'd been in the project since the blueprinting. he would never tell me a price total so i just had to go with a low number i felt wouldn't get extra pressure layer upon me as i know now and shortly after that the start up for the building and everything inside was under my amount i three in. but i was told if i owned to much more responsibility would come. since i'd just given almost all of my money for the start up i couldn't afford high bills and he knew that. so now we have been open for nearly 4 months, and i'm still really the only 1 spending on anything. for some reason the business pays for the rent but i pay the utilities and internet. when i told my percent i had stipulations that i get 10% ownership with manager wages and anything i make outside of the shop is my hard work paid off or the shop can buy it. i have received $0 told my manager wage will never exist and when i sold my product outside of the store he demanded 40% and me and my roommate i have help me make everything split 60%. he bought a keypad lock and never told me which door it was for i put it on the wrong door and that handle is corroded and breaks so he calls a locksmith from 2 hours away to come replace it and makes me pay the 600$ bill! he said we will not get money outside of tips until we profit after the initial opening cost....but he won't tell me the opening cost, how close we are & now he's trying to expand before we even make money as he is a stock man so he never isn't able to work. i came in today and was told i'd have another door change fee coming monday if i can't find a key i lost because he knows i'm struggling to pay every bill and i think is just trying to bully all my money out then when i can't pay take me to court for money i won't have. i don't even get the tips i get given he keeps them for other disclosed billing amounts i'll never know the paid amount. i suffer from depression social anxiety and schizoid syndrome so this is very hard on my well being. please reddit if you can help me find a way out and any way i could get a even half my money back since i am owner not investor. and i have a friend moving close that wants to be my actual partner not someone taking advantage of someone much younger than him. the store runs on his no life hours so we are here everyday from around 8 30 until 7 30-8p.m. counting the hour drive. i recently got to go home and see my family for the 1st time in nearly a year and he told me i had 3 days to get there and back. i just want out and some of my return i can't keep working 12-13 hour days then have to work on products for the store on my own time.

i need a business advice for the rest of my life	hi everyone, i have a business proposal that could change my life. for better or worse. don't know yet. and i really need your advice. i am 27 years old, working on math and programming area. i have a proposal from someone i know to form a new company together starting on a specific subject, but in less than a year, expand to a few more target areas. to simplify it, let's say that we have 3 target areas to work. i am professional familiar with all of them, where the other guy is only with the one of them. he will put all the necessary money, which is an investment of about $100k and we will both work the same. the idea is to get a percentage somewhere between 25-40%. still discussing about it. till now, everything seems great. the difficult part is that he wants to include on our contract a rule, that we will both be obligated to do whatever we want in the future under the same company with the same percentages. and only if we both agree. even if i have the time or the money to invest on something else, i will not be able to do it, unless we do it together. the same from him of course. however, if i have an idea for a new project in the two target areas that he is not familiar and i will work on them, i will still have the same, fixed percentage in the company . i see it as a great opportunity to start a company with $0 investment and almost no personal risk. the other guy is far older than me, close to retirement , but he is a great man on the business, paid a 4-5 digit amount for business consulting. however, i will be bind to something for the rest of my life, without the option to work on something else or proceed to another job opportunity in the future. and if i want to work on a new project, i will be obligated to share a big percentage of it with someone who hasn't even knew what i do. what do you think? is it wise to accept such an offer or reject it since it will be against my future?	dantek88	/r/business/comments/42mc9f/i_need_a_business_advice_for_the_rest_of_my_life/	5	1	0	1.0	1453740675.0

how do i start selling handmade jewelry at craft markets?	hi everyone! first time poster on this subreddit and i am hoping to get some advice since i do not know much about selling products or starting a business. i make jewelry and am looking to occasionally sell them at local craft markets in southern california. it looks like i need a sellers permit to sell at most markets. my questions are 1 do i need to have a business in place in order to get a sellers permit? 2 if i do need a business in place, i don't think i would want to apply for a sole proprietorship because of the personal risk but i wouldn't want to apply for a llc in california because of the minimum tax . would i be able to set up a llc in another state and be able to get a sellers permeant in california without applying for a foreign llc? this would be a small side job as i work full time so in all likelihood i wouldn't be making too much money. if anyone has any tips i would be much appreciative! thanks!	barnyardbenny	/r/business/comments/42prj3/how_do_i_start_selling_handmade_jewelry_at_craft/	4	6	0	0.73	1453781443.0

having trouble deciding what to major in business. advice?	hello, i am trying to decide what to major in. in your experience, what is the best, what is the worst? also, if one of these happens to be a joke major , please tell me so i don't waste my time. accounting i did good in finance and i am doing okay in managerial, all though it's just the entry level classes. some of the pros are the fact that you can do anything with an accounting degree, and i wouldn't have a crazy hard time finding a job. the cons are i don't know if i truly like it yet. i find it interesting, but i hear stories about how people are overworked, underpaid, and the market is saturated. not to mention, i need to bring my gpa up, and i am not sure i could do that with some of the harder accounting classes. then again, i am in it for a good life and comfortable living with a respected job. if i was in it for the passion, i would major in history. corprate finance this is what i am on track for currently. i've always had a strong interest in investments, and some of the aspects of finance. the concern is fining a job in a competitive market, and people bash finance a lot for some reason, if you have seen any of my other posts. i have no problem starting low and working my way up, as long as i am not working at burger king. my goal is to start at at least 40k. mis i've had a interest in computers in programming, but in my school you need calc 2, and i don't see myself getting a gd grade in it, maybe not even passing. i am not sure if this is a sought after major, as it's kind of a hybrid. i would like more info if possible, if anyone knows. people have told me to stay very clear of business administration and marketing. is there any truth to this?

managers of small teams - what are your pain points?	hi /r/business my name is nico, and i'm a certified scrummaster. i've worked in the software industry for about 3 years now . since i've obtained my csm certification, our small team has made a drastic improvement in communication, shortening iterations & the product lifecycle, and overall team happiness - but, the csm certification is expensive, a pain, and not worth the investment if you're outside of the software industry. the main skills used in scrum could easily be applied more broadly, and as a fun side-project, i wanted to create an online course to help managers benefit from the core foundations of scrum, without having to shell out the money and time of doing an actual csm course. my ask managers of smaller teams, whether or not you're in the software industry, what exactly are your pain points? being that i manage a small team, i'm familiar with the typical surface issues like communication , collaboration etc. but i want to hear in exactly your words. i wish i could... i hate it when.. my job would be 10x easier if i could... my job would be 10x easier if i didn't have to... thanks in advance = 	whistleking	/r/business/comments/49uyxr/managers_of_small_teams_what_are_your_pain_points/	4	2	0	0.63	1457637554.0

why does everyone think communications is the new business degree?	so i'm in business school in college. i go to state university, and i'd like to think that i've done pretty well so far in my nature. with that being said, i'll admit but it hasn't been the easiest experience for me. business is really tough. from statistics to operations management to the formidable business finance you learn a hell of a lot of business concepts and greatly improve your analytical skills during your time in college. but something i'm seeing more and more of lately are communications majors going into business. normally this wouldn't so much as turn my head, let alone annoy me. but a lot of them have one thing in common the chip on their shoulder. i'm meeting an increasing number of communication majors who think they are cheating the system by getting a communications degree. but they usually talk about it with a smug expression on their face, much like one a war veteran would wear after coming home victoriously from a fierce battle. yeah, i majored in communications. it was the easiest thing ever. i got straight a's. the courses were super, super easy. this is a typical sentence spoken from the mouth of a communications major. additionally, there's another phrase that seems to come up quite a bit that manifests itself in many different forms. i honestly don't think a business degree is necessary at all. have you seen the stuff that managers do? you hardly use anything that you would learn from a business degree. communications is the same, more or less. it might actually be a little bit more important, because communicating is essential in business. although not spoken verbatim from every mouth of a communications major, this seems to be quite a frequent theme for those who have pursued or are currently pursuing a communications degree. there seems to be a general consensus that business degrees aren't necessary, or are just a bunch of fluff and therefore communications is more important than business in terms of degrees. so am i missing something? perhaps i either slept through the momentous day when communications became the new business degree, or i'm just not drinking the same juju juice that all of these communication majors are. tl;dr communications majors think that their degree is more important then a business degree, and are attempting to play off their communications degree as equivalent to a business degree despite being a much, much easier course of study.		/r/business/comments/4afd0t/why_does_everyone_think_communications_is_the_new/	2	0	0	0.5	1457992868.0

local 3pl vs international - does anyone have experience with this?	hi guys, i've started up my kickstarter, circle footwear, and then have them transported to a 3rd party logistics company here who would separate, repackage and ship all the individual pairs of shoes to the end customers. shipping fees can be pretty high from canada to asia, so it made me reconsider my current model in favor of a 3pl in china. this would save me in shipping overseas to warehouse here. it would also be an advantage since hk has some of the most aggressive shipping rates in the world. does anyone have experience with this - the legalities of it and such?	lucusice	/r/business/comments/4b5ekk/local_3pl_vs_international_does_anyone_have/	2	10	0	0.92	1458431446.0
career advice soon to be mba graduate	so i am about to graduate with an mba from a pretty good program in florida. i have spent the last two months consulting for free to over 45 small businesses and entrepreneurs. i started applying for jobs to companies that are just amazing that are growing fast and treat their employees with tons of benefits and create a fun atmosphere. so far i have only heard back from one awesome tech company that i truly admire and love but its for a sales assistant position. i don't know what compensation is yet, but i would imagine it be on the lower end. also the description of the job doesn't seem to be that challenging, but they reached out to me to apply for the position. i also have thought about the idea of starting my own business brokerage firm here but trying to learn more about how it works and if it is sustainable. i am starting to reach out to mentors and advisers on trying to get more of an idea in what i should do. is it worth to go ahead and accept a position at an amazing company but not really challenge myself or make as much as i think i'm worth to just start getting some experience and my foot in the door. or should i try to start my own venture and perhaps license myself to consult and start charging people.	restcourageous	/r/business/comments/4bfana/career_advice_soon_to_be_mba_graduate/	2	2	0	0.63	1458608901.0

advice for new jr exec on navigating office politics - specifically other experts who seem to be trying to deflate the new kid on the block.	i was out of the fulltime workforce for a while with my kids and a few years ago went back for a graduate degree and reentered full time work. my second act has been very satisfying and successful and for the first few years had a couple of great mentors, worked my ass off, and felt fully supported by my superiors. i accomplished a lot by anyones standards and am proud of being able to navigate a successful gratifying comeback. recently, i was plucked from my group by a former coworker into basically my dream job and into a jr executive position. it was a big step for me and im excited to prove myself but honestly im in a bit over my head. im fine with that willing to work hard and learn and contribute to the group. however im dealing with an odd dynamic that im not sure how best to cope with/respond to. first my director supports me 100% and that relationship is great. the problem is that a couple of different colleagues have taken to needling me is the best way i can think of to describe it. never in the presence of my director interestingly, but in front of others and one-on-one, they pretend that they dont understand what im saying and that my ideas are absurd and misguided. its almost like theyre pretending we speak a different language. its so bizarre. one example in a recent meeting i said that i was going to start a project by focusing in on only 1 of the 2 types of widgets we are making and one of the consultants said, theres only 1 type of widget. i pointed to the charter that clearly and painstakingly describes and shows in a diagram two types of widgets literally pointed it to it and she was like no, we only have 1 type of widget, you have to focus on all the widgets. i felt as if id pointed to the sky and said look its blue and she said no, its yellow and purple stripes you idiot. both are consultants they don't really work together so i dont suspect collusion. if this was just happening with one person i might think oh its just this one person who must be eccentric. but its two unrelated folks, forcing me look inward at what part im playing. now granted i do not speak the consulting jargon, but i do believe that good ideas can be conveyed in a straightforward manner and that you dont need a convoluted matrix approach to every simple analysis. i feel like ive always been very open to constructive criticism, but this seems mean spirited, very defensive, and clearly indicates a lack of trust of me on their part. im positive im contributing to this dynamic in a negative way but i cant identify it or figure out how to circumnavigate it. i did get a little defensive in that meeting but then stopped the conversation and said hey lets start over were obviously having a miscommunication and that diffused things a bit, but then she spent the rest of the meeting sighing and muttering i understand now as if to say now its clear youre an idiot. this consultant and the other are both highly regarded and people i will have to get along with and likely travel with internationally. i have to figure this out. its very jarring after being in such a supportive environment for so many years, but im no shrinking violet and really want to make these relationships work. we dont have to be best friends but we need to cultivate a mutual respect and find a way to be productive. im fully aware that i am just sort of medium smart i was hired for my work ethic/doggedness and my ability to get along with anyoneironically. this is part of what i built my reputation on i had very difficult coworkers in my previous positions but they were easy to manipulate and i knew how to diffuse and get along with them even when no one else could. but now, im in a different echelon and hate feeling out of my league. any advice, no matter how brutal is welcome. if you know of a better sub to xpost in please let me know that too.	ketovor	/r/business/comments/4bmmaq/advice_for_new_jr_exec_on_navigating_office/	24	28	0	0.89	1458742386.0

want to start a business teaching guitar lessons... not sure where to start?	hi there! i currently work at a desk job and although i like the company, i would like to try to branch out into my own business. i teach guitar lessons as a side job, i've been playing for over 10 years and teaching for one, and i'd like to make that my full time gig. however, i am not sure where to start as i don't have a lot of experience in the field of branding, marketing, organizing, etc. i would like to do lessons via skype or facetime so that i can reach out to students all over the world, instead of just being stuck to my local areas and having to drive everywhere. so some of my questions would be... what would be a good target audience for this kind of endeavor? currently i work with mostly kids, as their parents tend to have the income to spend on lessons and kids tend to learn a lot faster than adults. should i stick with this demographic or branch out to work with upper/middle class adults? what is a good way to market and promote my lessons? right now i've been promoting my lessons using reddit posts, craigslist, and just putting up flyers at guitar center and sam ash. however, i'd like to develop a presence on social media. should i develop my own site, facebook page, etc. or go through currently existing websites? how much would people generally pay for a lesson? currently i am only charging $20 an hour, which is very cheap compared to many other teachers . i'd like to charge at least $40 an hour. how can i push this price and attract people willing to pay for it? thanks to anyone who has useful feedback, it's much appreciated! 		/r/business/comments/4ch0hj/want_to_start_a_business_teaching_guitar_lessons/	2	2	0	0.75	1459279082.0

how much is upgrading a blog to an advanced platform worth?	i had a deal in principle to build an add-on subdomain to an existing website. the owner of the site and i agreed to a 50/50 split on that project. then, during our brainstorming session, i led him through a series of scenarios whereby we ultimately changed the whole plan. instead of me building a subdomain, i will build the platform for a complete relaunch of his site. to me, this new deal doesn't entitle me to half. for the subdomain, i was bringing a vision and platform, and he was boosting it with his publishing and branding expertise. but when we relaunch his site on my platform, it's not as simple as saying, ok, we take the revenues minus costs for subdomain.domain.com and we each keep half. there are way more moving parts and his site has been one of the leaders in its niche for almost a decade. so i imagined we could create a deal based on performance metrics. create a projection of the site's performance without my intervention, then give me half of what my changes to the site add to that. it's not as simple as half of the increase in revenue, either. one major concern is that ad revenues are on a fairly steady rise. but traffic isn't growing in the same way that it had in years past, thanks to factors including a general decline in blog readership caused by platforms like instagram, as well as the possibility if not likelihood of the mobile app we're launching cannibalizing some nontrivial portion of existing web traffic. i was thinking, get a projection of the next few years' numbers based on the past several years' numbers, plus relevant market trends. take that projection, and my compensation/equity package will be based on a profit delta . half or slightly less of that amount. but then there's the notion that if this wasn't valuable to him and if he didn't see a major reason to risk rebuilding his entire site around a new platform, we wouldn't even be having these discussions. along with revenues, we have the notion of venture capital. we're considering a stealth launch for the new site design and mobile apps. we're looking into raising money. he has a good connection at a major silicon valley vc firm. investors are looking to capitalize on our niche, but before i pitched to my partner-to-be, he never had a substantial offering to show them. so how much should i ask for? both salary and equity. are there any resources or similar cases i can research and compare with? thanks!	iftherestime	/r/business/comments/4dcj5j/how_much_is_upgrading_a_blog_to_an_advanced/	3	1	0	0.6	1459796291.0

seeking advice, dealing with my alcoholic boss	i work at a small business and i have recently been promoted to the second in charge over the course of four years. the owner and i have spent a lot of time talking over the years and have shared some pretty deep stuff and gotten to know each other. we hang out outside of work every once and a while. the problem is he is an alcoholic. in our office is a file cabinet filled with booze. he drinks almost every day at work, he is big into the bar scene and he has quite the liquor cabinet at his house too. he chooses the fun and pretty women on our staff to spend afternoons drinking with him. recently i broke up with my girlfriend who works at the same company and she has become one of his new on the clock drinking buddies. i have to admit i drink with him myself every once and while. the problem isnt that he gets sloppy and is unable to run the business properly, its something else. our work setting is pretty informal and the lines between coworker and friend are very blurred. everyone except the most oblivious staff know whats in the cups. they know if you are an office girl you get to drink with the boss man. it causes nasty resentment between staff members. the idea that if certain people get to sip vodka and shoot the shit with the owner why should they have to work hard? when staff slack off my middle management job goes from fun to frustrating really quick. i literally lose sleep over it. the situation puts an enormous strain on my mental health. if might be because i still havent 100% gotten over my breakup and he flirts with my ex like he does with every woman. it might also be because when hes drinking all the responsibility for running the business falls on my shoulders. last night i woke up at 12 30 am stewing on this issue and again at 3 30. i have panic dreams about work filled with symbolism and sometimes dreams where i literally confront him about his drinking. i know customers have an idea whats going on because some of the women leave bottles on the desk and you can obviously smell the booze. he is a cronic womanizer and a self-described dirty old man even though he is 38. recently, he mentioned that he wanted to try to tone down the drinking at work especially with certain girls who are under 21. i said yeah man lets do it but it has only just escalated. he makes excuses by telling people i work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and i deserve to relax at the end of the day. his brothers life has been ruined by alcoholism, his brother seems to be in and out of rehab constantly. what do you guys think i should do? i care about him as a friend and my mental health is deteriorating fast from jealousy and anger. if you need any clarification on any point just ask thank you so much reddit	Storm6	/r/business/comments/4dj8we/seeking_advice_dealing_with_my_alcoholic_boss/	5	9	0	0.79	1459900680.0
please tell me how i'm wrong about a change in minimum wage	i'm not supporting or fighting an increase in minimum wage, but i do want to see if i am missing something in my analysis. i got in a somewhat ridiculous argument about minimum wage here on this subreddit, and i said this >but it isn't one to one. labor is only a portion of a business's expense, so if wages increase by 20%, the products don't suddenly go up by 20% because other expenses are still static. in other words, if labor represents 40% of a business's expenses, then that portion will go up by 20%. some other expenses may also go up as they are passed through from other companies with increasing labor costs. but overall, the increase in the price of goods will not match the increase in labor costs, as there are some expenses that will not increase. that comment got downvoted in this subreddit, so although i feel pretty confident that i am right, i would rather find out for sure, just in case. thoughts?	brentwilliams2	/r/business/comments/4dmax1/please_tell_me_how_im_wrong_about_a_change_in/	5	1	0	0.67	1459957450.0
lead generation companies are charging a premium and getting in between me and my customers holding small business at a ransom what are your experiences?	many people view lead generation companies in a positive light. and perhaps some deserve credit. however, over the past 8-10 years i am not seeing a good enough return on investment for the premiums that are being charged. this may be a really stupid way of looking at it but imagine going fishing but instead of having access to the pond and using your own pole somebody else holds the poll gets in your way and offers you the fish for a very very high price. that's how i view lead generation. i am able to do it myself but unfortunately the cost of even fishing in certain ponds is just so high i can't compete. you could argue that they are able to refine the sales funnel and give you much more concentrated, and much warmer leads closer to purchasing. what are other peoples experiences with lead generation or advertising in general. i have considered going back to walking the streets with flyers because it's cheap and i don't have to compete with 10 other companies fighting over key walkways. i accept that it works for many people but what are some other peoples experiences especially young start ups?

how much do i charge? 	i currently run a small business in the field of it and computer building/repair. i'm not exactly the most comfortable person when it comes to talking about money. in fact i hate telling my customers how much their computer costs or how much i'm charging them for cleaning out their computers or etc. i was confronted by someone i struck conversation with and they told me that i needed to charge hourly for making someone's computer or that i needed to charge higher prices on what i did. and around 15-20 for cleaning and rebooting a system. if a job requires me to drive out to them, i don't know how to really put a price on it. do i charge them by distance, time to get there, what? and when i get there, do i charge based on how difficult the situation is or do i just keep a base hourly cost? i've only been in business since november 2015, so this is still new to me. thanks again, reddit!!	rgbasrawi	/r/business/comments/4ek5y5/how_much_do_i_charge_not_sure_if_this_is_the/	12	10	0	0.86	1460524882.0

need help figuring out a presentation for pitching columbian coffee company to us investors who would also be helping build livable work sites.	i am taking an international business course at my university and my final project is a sales pitch where i am representing a foreign company who is selling a product to us investors. the project requires a background of your companies current political, econimic, social and cultural standing. the product i am choosing to sell is fresh, fair-trade coffee from columbia. we're not just another coffee company though. we will essentially be a non-profit organization whose proceeds will go directly towards building liveable working quarters for the coffee pickers. currently the situation is inhumane offering workings cots with a wooden overhang above for shelter. there are no walls on many of these huts so insects and animals are free to come and go as they please. our company would be dedicated to building sites where these people can live and socialize and earn minimum wage or more for their duties. any thoughts? edit spelling, using mobile -_-	JELLOvsPUDDIN	/r/business/comments/4foz4r/need_help_figuring_out_a_presentation_for/	2	2	0	0.75	1461179292.0

need advice on how i should go about getting paid with company stock/ shares from a company im about to join that has no capital to pay a salary at the moment.	hello i was hoping for some advice on how i should go about getting paid with company stock/ shares from a company im about to join that has no capital to pay a salary at the moment. so the problem for now is i dont know how much stock/ shares i should ask for as compensation, considering there is no capital for salaries at the moment. i know this doesn't sound like a good idea, to take no salary at first, but the company has the potential to really take off. the company i want to join has been around for a few years, but recently shed all their workers and essentially needs to fill all positions. im going for president / coo, and cto. ill be managing most of the business as president/ coo, as well as setting up the ecommerce platform and online marketing for the company as the cto. the company was valued at 9million when it was founded about five years ago, but that valuation is much lower now, lower than 4 million, maybe as low as 1 million i suspect. they have 100 shares total, and they are currently offering investors a 1% share of the company for a $40,000 investment. i suspect each share is worth much less in reality, but this is what they are sticking at for now. so when i go in and ask for the president/ coo and cto positions, i want to be able to ask for more shares in the company, since the salary would not initiate for at least a month, maybe longer. so what should i do? tldr how many shares should a president/ coo get paid if there is no salary for a month or two? how much should a cto get paid in shares if there is no salary for a month or two? how many shares should i ask for if i fulfill these two positions, but dont get paid a salary for a few months? thanks!

what benefit could a business have by a high employee turnover rate?	first time in /r/business but i have a question that i couldn't figure out where to post. i didn't see it in the rules but i'll avoid naming the company. i recently accepted a job with a relatively large software company and when i was doing a campus tour, i noticed that everyone working there is fairly young. i didn't think much of this at the time and it seemed like a pretty cool place to work and i enjoy software development so i accepted their offer. but then i've been reading some articles about the company and i realized that they seem to have a high rate of turnover. people will work for about a year or two and then get let go for no reason at all it seems. there are posts on glassdoor and other places where people talk about a seemingly great relationship with their team and then they get a notice. even people that transfer to a new team get let go right as they begin work on the new project. i'm not sure what to make of this. any thoughts on why a company would do this?

need advice on helping my restaurant	i'm not at all sure if this is the place to ask for advice, so please excuse me if i'm crossing a line here. i work as a server for a major seafood restaurant chain and my particular restaurant is coming back from horrid management. the new management is phenomenal and has brought us back leagues from where we used to be, but we're still dealing with back to back issues. the most obvious of these to me are the servers and hosts at night. personally, i have an issue giving a share of my tips to a host that isn't doing his or her busing side work. the dinner shift is separated into cliques and the atmosphere among the foh staff is akin to something from a prison yard. on the topic of tips, i shouldn't make more during lunch than i do at night. something's up with either the rotation, the quality of the guests or the quality of the service i provide. i don't mean to boast, but i put in the extra mile for that extra tip, so i can't see my service as an issue. the bartenders are fresh and need to work on their speed/confidence, but they seem to rise above the weird drama across the rest of the staff. no complaints here. here's the thing; i'm used to putting in my two weeks and finding something better , but there's something about our current management and the servers that do work hard that i don't want to bail on. - i carry my weight on the floor and do a little extra when people are in the weeds. - my sidework isn't reserved for the end of my shift. it gets done. - i pick up shifts left and right and work doubles consistently. my question to you is what can i do to essentially and metaphorically step in and say hey, i work hard and i want the people that work hard to go home with more money. what can i do to help? tl;dr i work at a restaurant and my foh dinner crew is crappy. halp.	jacobtcornell	/r/business/comments/4lb2qr/need_advice_on_helping_my_restaurant/	2	2	0	1.0	1464360687.0

can someone explain the businees-economic stance of adidas when selling yeezy boost 350?	hi, i'm confused about adidas selling yeezy boost 350 . they pay something to produce it and sell it for $200 in a limited quantity. then, some people that got a pair sell it for $700-1200 on ebay. my question is how is adidas not trying to put their hands on the difference between their launching price and the auction price on ebay ? so far, i came up with two ideas 1. this is a price they pay in order to make more product buzz, so as to spread their name and influence. for instance, i didn't know what boost is before reading about yeezy boost . so extra points for adidas in a customer's mind 2. the people on ebay are their men, but this sounds too much of a conspiracy theory. all in all, this is what happens to any limited edition product, meaning that it may be sold at an auction , but these shoes seem more hyped.		/r/business/comments/4m1llm/can_someone_explain_the_busineeseconomic_stance/	4	7	0	1.0	1464792548.0

how to choose mold material for plastic injection molding in china?	we have been in mold industry for more than 10 yearsresponmoulding , and about half of our molds are made for foreigners. some of our customers know much about mold and molding, so they would like to specify the mold material. but some of them do not know anything about it. usually, we would suggest mold material for them as per the parts material, part constructure and estimated quantity in the future. most of them, they appreciate our suggestions, and would accept it. but a few of them, they do not like it, and insist to use another material. maybe they think we just want to make the price lower or higher to make more profit. but acctually, not at all. if the parts material is not transparent, the mold material can be softer and cheaper. if the part constructure is not complicated, and no sliders or angle lifters should be applied, the mold material can also be softer and cheaper. if the estimated quantity is very small, the mold material can be softer and cheaper... but none of the above 3 points can be separated. they should all be considered together to choose the most suitable mold material. with the most suitable mold material, you can not only get what you want to make from the production, but also save a lot of cost, not for the manufacturer, but for yourself. otherwise, you would not only ruin the mold, but also waste all of your money. for example, if the part material is rubber, and simple design, p20 or even 45 steel or aluminum is ok. oppositely, if the part material should be pmma/acrylic transparent, the mold should be mirror polished, s136h or better mold material should be used, or the parts will be scratched and look ugly. in a word, when you are not sure about what mold material should be used, do not specify it, and just ask recommendation from the manufacturer.	chinamoldmaker	/r/business/comments/4ml88k/how_to_choose_mold_material_for_plastic_injection/	4	3	0	0.67	1465088680.0

i own a partnership 50/50 and want to lower my responsibilities, any advice?	like the title said, i own a partnership 50/50 with a partner. we started the business 5 years ago when we were 20. up to this point, we have split everything 50/50 but over the last 6 months, i have realized i want to spend some of my time elsewhere and give up some of my responsibilities with the partnership. i don't think the best call is to step away completely but i've been brainstorming ideas to essentially tell my partner you control the reigns now, you take the company where you want it to be. i'll contribute in x, y, and z ways for a 30% stake in the company, giving you 70% or a similar percentage, 35/65, 40/60 you get the picture. is this the right way to do it? i want to stay involved physically and financially, but would like to pass off the burden of responsibility to my partner who would be more than willing to take on the challenge. also, we currently have about 10k in our bank account, so financially would we split the remaining 50/50 and then any profit that comes in would then be split with the new percentage? this is all new to me and i'm trying to navigate it in a way where we are all happy. lastly, is there a difference between 50/50 ownership and 50/50 payout ? for instance, should i negotiate where i still own 50% of the company but am just paid less because i do less of the work? not sure how this all works. any and all advice would be appreciated! thanks.	slowwwly	/r/business/comments/4oeo67/i_own_a_partnership_5050_and_want_to_lower_my/	6	8	0	1.0	1466099740.0

step by step how to import from china	many people want to start up their own business and import, but don't know what's the next step? as per my 6 years custom plastic injection molding international sales experience , below are the general steps 1, do some basic research of the products you need to import is it worth importing? is it my favorite? 2, try to know what and how the products are made of? whether a tooling/mold should be applied. how to get different pattern or color. no matter whatever you will do, be more professional. 3, find what you decide to go for, and get quotes from several companies, not only to compare the price, but also to discuss more in the future to decide whom you will move forward with. 4, ask customer references from the suppliers, and check their honesty. scammers can be found everywhere, not only in china, so being careful is better. if they are real companies, their export records can be found by google, such as portexaminder, tradesparq, tradesns, panjiva, importgenius, etc. 5, ask for a po/pi with all the details, including trade terms, payment terms, quantities, prices, etc. 6, pay the deposit, better not to pay 100% in advance. 7, ask for samples before mass production, to double check the quality and assembling,etc. 8, during the manufacturing, you can let the manufacturer estimate the packing, including carton size, how many pcs/carton, gross weight per carton, how many cartons totally. then you can check which way is the most cost-effective for you by courier like dhl? or by air? or by sea. if by courier, it is easy. 9, if by air or by sea, you need to find several forwarders or ask the manufaturer's forwarder to quote for the shipping. also, remember to check their honesty. you need to let them know how and where you would like to ship to door?or to air/sea port? which sea/air port? what's the shipping address, and what's the consignee/notify party's information. usually the consignee is the same as the notify party. but if you do not want your goods be shipped to you but to your customer, you can have your company as the consignee, and have your customer's company as the notify party. 10, prepare to find a local customs broker to clear the customs for you, otherwise, you can not pick up the goods. note if you are american, remember to let them file the isf for you, or you will be fined about 5000usd. some forwarders can do it and some brokers can also do it. ask them, and officially notify them to file the isf for you within 48 hours before the vessel leaves the loading port. 11, let the manufacturer contact your decided forwarder to transport the goods to the loading port's warehouse. 12, let the forwarder notify you when the vessel leaves, and the eta. 13, when the goods arrive at the sea/air port, your appointed customs broker should clear the customs for you, and then you can arrange the pick-up. if quoted to door, you can ignore this step. if your trade terms with the manufacturer is balance paid before shipment, the balance payment should be done before no.11; if balance paid as per copy of b/l, the balance payment should be done between no.11 and no.13, but before no. 13, in case your goods can not be customs cleared that extra demurrage fee will be charged.	chinamoldmaker	/r/business/comments/4rgnfo/step_by_step_how_to_import_from_china/	2	10	0	0.69	1467777135.0

how much skill does it take to run a business?	posting this here because i just finished a four-year stint of working in retail... basically, i'd worked there long enough to become a manager. the only reason i never did was because none of the standing managers ever left. i was offered a management position and decided to decline it during my trial period because i simply didn't enjoy it even though i was offered the position. the department i was offered management over didn't interest me. since turning down the position, my managers started treating me like a child, acting extremely critical and condescending toward me. they'd identify and inflate every single minuscule problem they had with my work when they hadn't before. before i turned down the position, they had nothing but good things to say about my work. even during the trial period, they thought i had a ton of potential. i've been able to see their true colors since then, and they've definitely used their power as leverage to intimidate me since then. basically, what i'm asking is, how much skill does it really take to run a business? were they possibly insulted that i turned down the position? i don't want to sound cocky by any means, but there have been times that i've thought that i could do my managers' jobs as good as or even better than them. we have the same level of education at this point. i lack the experience that they do, but customers frequently approach me like i'm already a manager. every single new trainee at my old company has told me that they assumed i was in management because i was usually the person training them. i don't know. what special skill set does it take to run a business? i have absolutely no interest in pursuing that line of work, but patience and the ability to keep calm and multitask strike me as the key abilities of a businessman. when i think of doctors and engineers and lawyers, i think of a special set of skills...when i think of a ceo, i think about corruption, nepotism and back-handedness done with a level head. i know i'm wrong, but i'm just venting from my experience in retail. i'm not making this post to say that businessmen are unskilled. i'm making it to understand what exactly makes a good businessman and why it's so special.		/r/business/comments/4tpjwg/how_much_skill_does_it_take_to_run_a_business/	1	0	0	0.5	1468990921.0

i need some serious advice for big decision in my business. people want to partner with me.	ok so i started the first snack company in my country in an area that no one has exploded yet. i have practically no direct competitors and i am inventing the market for this product here. i literally just started. ive been working on it for the last year and a half and two weeks ago launched it. i cant say it blew up, but for the small scale im working at, it shows a hell of a lot of promise. people are starting to notice it. everyone close to me is intrigued by how ive been able to put out a professionally looking product with so little money, experience and help. i designed everything , researched everything for the product, imported everything, i am managing the social media accounts, selling, networking, and producing the product all by myself. so ive put in a whole lot of blood sweat and tears into this, but now its starting to seem too much just for one person to do right. before i launch the product on social networking sites i wanted to show a good friend and his partner who have their own promotions company what i was doing to see if they could give me some tips, help me out, etc the thing is they immediately believed in my product and saw what it could grow to be. a couple of days go by and we meet up again and they say they want in. normally i would have said no and have been dead set since i started on not giving a percentage to anyone, but they have a lot to offer in terms of growth and knowhow in an area that i dont manage very well yet. they also want to offer general help with the whole business. i feel its important to have partners you can rely on in order to grow your business as fast as possible, because im already starting to collapse with all the things i have to worry about myself and i know i wont do them correctly if im doing it all. they are willing to work for free at the start and only receive a salary when the business can truly provide it. they can help me grow fast, and that is what tempts me the most. i told them that the only way to reach some sort of terms is if we immediately grow the operations to the next level and no business experience . think of this business and the next big snacking trend in south america that could potentially be worth a lot of money. i know i can grow the business to that level by myself, but it would take a while and a lot of money that i dont have yet, and possibly by then a big company might have put out the same product for less money and never let me get to be the big company. maybe if i grow it fast enough a huge brand might want to buy me out. my main passion is being able to see my ideas come to life, not necessarily being super rich. the sooner i grow this, the sooner i can do more things that i am passionate about. these potential partners have a similar vision as me and we would all work together in future projects also. what do i need your help with? basically i have decided that i want to work with them but i dont know what would be a correct percentage to give them. they know this is my baby from the start and that i wont give them a big or even a medium part of the business. what percentage would you give each of them? what demands would you ask for in order to reach an agreement? what general tips can you give me to help me out with potentially one of the biggest decisions in my life? thank you all in advance and sorry if its not very well written.	ssalomon311	/r/business/comments/4uskfq/i_need_some_serious_advice_for_big_decision_in_my/	2	3	0	1.0	1469589063.0

what are the advantages/disadvantages of private labeling a product for a company in a completely different field?	as a business, we have found a niche product that is already created, but by a large company that is not in our industry. the company that has this product , is in the food/kitchen industry which is a completely different field than what our business is in. we were thinking they could private label this product for us because the potential for the product is extremely high for us. from what i see, there is no disadvantage to the company because it doesn't interfere with sales, being in a completely different industry and being sold at completely different stores for different reasons. it would only bring in cash flow to the company, right? what are some advantages for this company to private label this product for us? keep in mind that this company is a very large company. we are a a rapidly growing company that has expanded largely due to social media within the past 3 years. appreciate any responses, thanks.

18 year old looking to start my own business but i can't think of a business to start....advice?	so i'm an 18 year old kid, last year of high school and i'll be doing online classes so i can have more time. currently i'm working a 30 hour a week job with really shitty hours 5 00 pm to 10 00 everyday, but it's decent pay and right next to my house. i'm really just sick of working super bull shit jobs and want to start my own business. i've wanted to start my own business since i was really young, i've always been interested in it and i actually plan on going to college for business. i really have the will to do it, and i'm extremely money/success motivated but i just can't think of any business ideas. i'm smart with my money and really don't spend very much of it, most of it is in savings but i'm just wanting to start a business and quit my job when it picks up. i have no bills other than gas so, really all i have to loose is paychecks i could've gotten from my current job. i understand it's not easy and it's far from it, but this is something i want to do as a career later on so i figure now is a better time than ever. my real problem is just coming up with a business idea, my dad currently runs a non-profit company but from talking to him and learning from him i'd say i know a decent amount about the basics of running a business. i also took an entrepreneurship and business class. i have no idea's on what to start, and have been thinking for longer than i can remember, but still can settle on anything. btw i live in a city with about 250,000 people, nothing like l.a. but not a small town. i do have quite a few different tools, as well as i did take welding classes for a while and would consider myself a handy person. i should add i'm not wanting to start my own business because i'm a lazy teenager that hates putting in his time at shitty jobs, it's just that i really want to work for myself and i want the opportunity to be as successful or unsuccessful as my work ethic. i really am just sick of dealing with lazy people, and working jobs i can't move up in. i love the idea of only the sky being the limit for your own business and i want to dive into it. thanks for reading the post, all advice is appreciated. what i'm looking for is advice on how to go about starting a business, finding an idea, and actually doing it. also would appreciate any advice on what to stay away from and maybe any websites or articles that could help young entrepreneurs like myself.

how would you respond to this?	hi everyone, sorry if this comes off as more of a rant, but i do want some input on this particular front. i run a screen printing and sign fabrication shop, and i have been doing a little back-and-forth on pricing for a potential new client for their first printed t-shirt order. the client is an hotel/inn in a very expensive destination in our area. after sending them my standard pricing based on the number of colors & locations , specific t-shirt type , and quantity of shirts printed, she calls me up and tells me i've been paying on $7.90 per shirt, can you get it to closer to $7.90? i say, i will try, and we narrow down the exact brand of shirt they've been using, and turns out it is slightly less expensive, plus i throw in an additional 15% discount to push the price down to $7.77 per shirt for her and hopefully get the job and a new client. this is at the end of the day, so i get into the shop this morning to the following email actually started looking for them after i sent you the brand and found them in white for $3.95. are you able to order from this site? now, i've negotiated discounts with new clients and existing clients doing larger orders or package deals, etc. but for some reason this email made me say fuck you out loud as soon as i read it. now, my price for blanks is better than the one she found, but i have markups built into my pricing to cover my overhead, you know, so i don't go out of business, and i'm already giving her a deal. i can't really get a read on what she expects. she seemed like a reasonable and down-to-earth person on the phone, but i get the creeping feeling that she is used to her vendors bending over backwards for her. i will bend a little, but i'm no one's bitch. i started to write up a response like this i'm sorry, but my pricing includes a markup on the blank in addition to the printing that is calculated to cover my costs of materials, labor, equipment and shop overhead. the price i'm getting at my vendor is better than that one. but, then i got to thinking, i don't want her to think she knows how much i'm making without knowing my overheads, so now i'm leaning more to something like this i'm sorry, but i only deal with the industry standard vendors. i don't have a working relationship with that site and cannot guarantee that their products are safe for printing or are not factory seconds. , and just leaving out the price factor altogether. i'm usually pretty cool in these situations and figure out the right thing to say, but for some reason this one has caught me off guard. so, i haven't responded just yet. what do you guys think? am i worked up over nothing ? how would you respond? any suggestions on better negotiating pricing in general? thanks for your input!

advice for a young professional considering an online business degree?	i am currently 22, i am an assistant manager at a mega retail chain in the pacific northwest. my dream is to become a fashion buyer at this chain. my company has its own infrastructure to move up its employees even without a 4 year degree. however, i am looking to work towards a bachelors degree in business/fashion merchandising or something similar. i do not want to quit my job, as i now have close to two years of management experience. i want this degree to bolster my resume for the future and give me more career flexibility. what online degrees do you think are worth my time? i know that for-profit universities seem to be a waste, but i believe i need the time flexibility of an online degree to manage my job as well as school. thanks in advance for all your help!	170orDie	/r/business/comments/4y1kon/advice_for_a_young_professional_considering_an/	5	14	0	0.8	1471378225.0

licenses how important are they?	i recently had a job in direct sales for the local office of a large distribution company. after i signed up with them, i did further research on it and discovered that this office had been conducting business in the local municipalities outside the city where they are based, but without business licenses. in one town they were warned off by law enforcement with the threat of arrest if they attempted to conduct business in that town without a license. i had been travelling to a different, but nearby town for sales appointments. i was concerned that my employer might not have a license for that town either. when i presented this issue to the head manager, he brushed off my concerns and told me that despite the fact that they were warned off by police in one town, it didn't matter because they were only operating in that town for two days. he said that it wouldn't impact me or the rest of the sales team because the issue would be the fault of management, despite the fact that, as the ones in those towns going to those appointments, we would be the ones arrested if any one complained. the manager then tried to make excuses; getting a business license takes too long; that the fines for not having a license were smaller than the fees ; and that in some local small towns, there are no fees for business licenses , so in his view applying for one was merely a formality. i didn't believe his explanation, and decided to quit. despite their repeated claim to be the biggest distributor in the country of the type of product they sell, i couldn't work for a company that doesn't obey the law. my question is, how common is this practice? i have worked two direct sales jobs before, but this issue of business licenses never came up with either of them. how often do distribution companies, especially small ones, not bother with licenses in small towns and just hope not to get caught?	kdogprime	/r/business/comments/4ztvu0/licenses_how_important_are_they/	4	1	0	0.67	1472298054.0

i am not lazy, but i cant work for anyone, is it wrong to want your freedom ?	i am not a lazy person, and have many skills. the problem is i find it hard to work for anyone. when i am employed i find i have to bite my lip, so i dont speak unwelcomed truths, i have to pretend to like bosses that i abhor, i watch in confusion other employees forming cliques and small political gangs, i am a slave to a diary created by someone else. ...i dance to somebody elses tune, i am underpaid, i am generally unhappy, i feel like im a square peg in a round hole. if i am being honest, i know wages pay bills, but this is dire slavery. to me a full time job is handing your life away, and totally wrong, for what a steady wage. many will say that it is necessary to put a roof over your head, and i won't dispute that. but is it not far better to try and run your own business, where your own destiny is in your own hands...where you dance to your own tune, and can be honest, and build an empire that is more in line with your needs. i am on the cusp of stopping ever working for someone else other than myself, what i will do i dont know, how i will do it , i dont know.... all i know is that im through working for anyone. im hoping that this sheer despondent vision of being a wage slave will help make me a successs in my own venture. but im not sure that is enough. your thoughts are welcome. ps i dont mind working 16 hour day, as long as i am my own boss and dont have to put up with office nonsense ever again.	eb0t	/r/business/comments/50ex8v/i_am_not_lazy_but_i_cant_work_for_anyone_is_it/	4	2	0	0.6	1472610361.0

 i started a business club in my school - what should we do? 	 ______________________________________________________ think about your field of study that you might want to study in college. business most likely affects it in some direct or indirect way. the business clubs ambition is to help figure out what members are truly passionate about in life, and thereon pursue those passions to make a difference in both society and in their lives. members will be introduced and familiarized with the world of entrepreneurship in an attempt to generate enthusiasm and project it as a possible career option and a way to identify their core values in life. pursuits idea diffusion a component of the business club will allow members to elevator pitch one-line startup ideas; the people interested in the same idea can interact and form groups to begin making their vision a reality. the concept of the elevator pitch will be elaborated on, and will be key in actively teaching the basics of negotiation, leadership, and self-confidence. humanitarian ventures interested members will gain first hand experience on how forming ventures for humanitarian beliefs works. if that may seem a little difficult for one or more groups of the club, we can do a pilot run to get a better idea of how real life micro-businesses works. there will be an explanation to any regulations regarding this. active entrepreneurial engagement members will be taught the ins and outs of the contemporary brick and mortar and ecommerce consumer-purchasing processes, marketing tactics, quality control issues, niches, finding manufacturers, demographics, and etcetera to help them seamlessly create their own startup business under their own discretion relating to what they are passionate about. organic hard skills building our panel discussions will aid members in debating ideas and proposing new ones. leading, which requires endurance, will cause passion to emerge when satisfaction comes from the effort put in. with this, the members will theoretically develop a dedicated and entrepreneurial work ethic. workshops relating to startup skills will force active thinking and therefore cause creativity and independent thinking to form for itself, for oneself. __________________________________________________ although the note stated above covered pretty much what i am asking, to restate what are some of your guys' ideas to enact based on the pursuits i laid out to the club? the humanitarian ventures section is more of group projects like big fundraisers and charities, etc., but idea diffusion will be for a person to figure out an idea they want to pursue and actually do it. important my club is partnered up with the sadd organization, which can help for humanitarian ventures, and we are working with wise services, which gives you a high school academic credit and award after 100 hours of working on your individual idea, creating it, and making it a reality. my club also is partnered up with the entrepreneurial club in a college, and the president of it is also a ceo of a startup company and is interested in helping collaborate. lastly, i have the full support of another university to work with them on anything or have them come down to my school for whatever reason and offer support. sorry for the long post - just wanted to cover everything! thanks in advance for the replies, guys!	throwawayshitwiseau	/r/business/comments/547y3d/question_i_started_a_business_club_in_my_school/	6	2	0	1.0	1474678081.0

when all else fails, reengineer your business processes!	do you feel you have done everything to keep your business afloat and yet you feel it sink down under? do you feel like you're furrowing upward a gaping quicksand? well, it might be time that you took a closer look at the way you did business and reengineered your business processes. it's not a gesture of admitting defeat; in fact, numerous companies like starbucks and google have done this and have came back stronger than they were before. but what is business process reengineering , anyway? like many business lexicons, it's just what it is---a business lexicon. bpr is simply a fancy word for the process of reworking some radical and fundamental changes into your business in the hopes that it will ease your business' hurdles or enable you to get out of it completely. google, for example, reverted to a more process-driven interviewing process for its employees when they discovered asking random, intellectual questions were not giving them what they need. ford, meanwhile, decided to go paperless with their invoicing processes and saw a 75% decrease in their labor spend. this article details how to properly execute a bpr regardless if you are a large enterprise or a modest startup pick the most important processes . reengineer few elements at a time so you get a better idea of what's actually wrong. make a business process mapping . this prevents you from committing the same mistakes over and over with your business. cash in on technologies . it will save you time and money in the long run. view the new process as a mere prototype . it will be a process of trial-and-error and you would rarely land a hit the very first time. bpr is essential for any scale of business. the earlier a company did this, the better it will be for that company in the long run. what do you guys think? have you reengineered your business processes before? let's discuss!	patrickshitty	/r/business/comments/54qeod/when_all_else_fails_reengineer_your_business/	3	16	0	0.71	1474980690.0

friend and i are soon launching a product which is currently in development. would it be better for me to start a holding company to manage my assets vs being personally responsible? 	i have notebooks and notebooks full of ideas and inventions. most of them never even make it passed being on paper. i enjoy thinking of the logistics and manufacturing problems some of these ideas entail. i sometimes get close to actual development but life gets in the way. i have a good friend that is passionate about a particular project of mine and i plan to proceed in developing this project with plans to try and sell it. for the most part this project is done on paper and most of the work has been done by me up to this point. my friend will help build and research what is required for the final consumer version and i dont mind going 50/50 on ownership. in the future if this project goes well i would like to develop more of my ideas but not under the jointly owned company that my friend and i would have. the reason i want this is because some of these ideas have alot of work put into them and nobody seems passionate about the development just about the end cash out. it ends up being a 80/20 workload in the end and if i do the work i want majority ownership. would it be wise to start a separate holding company that would co own the ip my friend and i have? any other product that goes into development would i have to create another subsidiary company or could i use the holding company. do you think it's shady of me to do this? is there any perks of doing it this way? in the long run would it be expensive? is there any benefits to ownership under my personal name vs a cooperate identity? please forgive my formatting. touch screen cellphones are not the most user friendly when it comes to multiple paragraphs.

looking for advice on selling a business, without people knowing you are selling a business	my folks own a successful bar and grill. they took a former dump and turned it into a money maker over the last 8 years. remodeled everything, changed the menu, trained better staff, etc. they want to sell, but there are problems getting the word out. first, it's in a small town in wisconsin. drama spreads like wild fire, and the competition is jealous of their establishment and success, so any chance they can get to sling mud they take. if anyone were to find out they were on the market, it would be bad for business, employees might leave, etc. it would be the talk of the town. second, it's a pretty large operation. they have a bar, full restaurant and large banquet room where they host trade shows, weddings, concerts, etc. my mom is afraid that if the word gets out that they are selling, they will lose customers on the banquet side, specifically weddings that are often booked out a year or more in advance. no one wants to plan a wedding at a place that might change management. third, my folks are tired. they are overworked. it's a very hard business to run. yes, it is successful, but they need the right personality to take over. not many people have a lot of money in that area, so it's hard to find serious investors. they want to make sure a responsible party takes over, without scaring potential buyers away by the large workload and small margins. if you can't market your sale, how are you supposed to find this unicorn? any advice on how to sell a business without letting anyone know you are selling a business? thanks!	firesatnight	/r/business/comments/56sgbb/looking_for_advice_on_selling_a_business_without/	2	2	0	0.76	1476112584.0

why business process modeling is vital to your business	running a business is scary. to anyone. it almost feels like you, along with a team whod you dragged with you, are lost inside a labyrinthine maze. and every step can literally get you lost. this is why we have business processes. think of them as clues to solve the maze. they make you laser-focused on cracking the maze one process at a time. one way to use business processes effectively is by mapping them visually. this is what is called business process modeling or business process mapping. by laying them all in a clear visual, you can see the cause and effect of each step and start to understand the process flow properly. remember that every detail of a business process model directly affects the outcome, so it is highly important that you map them in such a way that its clear to you whats working and whats not. here are a few tips of how you can do this well - map the process as is - ignore process exceptions - involve those who execute the process - after a rough draft, document digitally and share - make sure to map on a big canvas - collect example documents for every step, if there are any these are from an article ive read that details how to map your business processes properly. i highly recommend you reading it because, contrary to what others might think, learning about this isnt entirely boring; in fact, it is enlightening. you know what frank gilbreth saidprocess charts pay.

i need help figuring out my job title .	my boss says he thinks my job title currently doesn't really make sense, and i agree. we need to figure out how to call my position and i was hoping to get some suggestions. here are some details - currently, we call the position service and quality supervisor . i work at a consulting firm, however i'm not a consultant. - my job is to be the first contact our clients have with us. this does not involve finding clients, since the firm belongs to the biggest law firm in the country, and 95% of the clients drip down from them. - other tasks include pricing, preparing service proposals, service agreements, quality/service supervision, performance reviews, client profitability analisis, and all sorts of commercial matters. i kinda know everything that goes on in the company, and my direct boss is the general manager. - i'm the only person in the company who does all this. - the idea is that i eventually become the commercial manager . i was thinking the best job title would be commercial supervisor, but maybe adding something else to it. the other one i was thinking of was business engagement supervisor , but that sounds like another name for sales supervisor, and my job doesn't really involve doing that or searching for clients. if someone know how the call the people who do my job at other consulting firms it would be great to know. thanks in advance.	nocjammo	/r/business/comments/5fq7xk/i_need_help_figuring_out_my_job_title_consulting/	4	2	0	0.67	1480520174.0
how do i monetize our work?	hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit so please let me know if i am doing something wrong. i will keep things brief. currently, i work at a grant writing company. in the grant writing world, we are doing extremely well. we turn away about 90% of potential clients due to our own bandwidth issues. i am sure there are different viewpoints on if that is a good or bad thing. anyways, we seem to have hit the ceiling for the work we do. currently, we are the go-to-team for socialization efforts, lobbying, grant writing, grant management, project management, sales, and introductions. unfortunately, we are terrible at monetizing these activities that undoubtedly create value for our clients. in fact, we typically charge for the grant writing and grant application but that is it! i am not looking for a response to solve this issue. i want to hire someone to help me figure this issue out - someone who knows how to pull all the value out of these activities. i look at it as some type of fixer who can come in, review what we do, and explain to me how poor we are at monetizing our work. is there a title for such a person? do they even exist? any assistance would be greatly appreciated.		/r/business/comments/5fs312/how_do_i_monetize_our_work/	2	5	0	0.86	1480538988.0

in my business i'd like to put up tv's and stream and loop specials/giveaways continuously...this post includes what i have tried already and found not to work very well.	- i have been using dropbox and just having it run through a slideshow but internet connection is a problem when it goes out. - i have also tried roku tv media player and that's an issue because people are bringing their own roku remote from their house and pulling up youtube. - lastly a usb drive is probably the most reliable but also not as easy to update in real time or off site. also someone pulled it out of the tv but that only happened once. here's this link to local ad face. basically local ad face probably has pro advertising software but relevant because they have the looping continuously issue figured out. i would use them but the deal is they get to advertise rent free other businesses in your business but they'll design you a couple ads as well. so ive been trying to figure out how they do it for just my business personally. any ideas would be great. thanks in advance!	tricep6	/r/business/comments/5h0gfd/in_my_business_id_like_to_put_up_tvs_and_stream/	2	1	0	1.0	1481124274.0

how to ask for a job offer from an informal company	i've been working for a very successful, but small company for the past 6 years. i started off in high school as a csr, and got a promotion in my 3rd year into a sort of administrative job. i got a raise every year i worked and they have treated me very well, and i love working there. since i started, the owner, who didn't go to college and is of the mindset that experience trumps degrees , has been begging me to come work there, even offering to pay for me to switch my major to business from my then-current healthcare degree. he always spoke of high salaries, great benefits and so many other job perks, and i completely believe him because he treats employees that he values very well. i told him two years ago that once i graduate college that i am committed to coming back and working for the company full time. he gave me a brief description of a couple places he could see me in the company, and i am very flexible and willing to go with whatever, provided i am good at it. but nothing has been set in stone. since it is a small company, so many things are done informally; there isn't even technically an hr department, one of the accountants just deals with that aspect of things. my only issue is that since i've grown to know him and the rest of my coworkers so well, everything is so informal and i have yet to receive a formal job offer. there is a chance that his talk of high salaries and perks could be smoke and mirrors, but i doubt it. i mainly just want to know how much my starting salary will be, and what my proposed job title will be; because with graduation only 5 months away i need to start looking at housing. i also want to ensure that my job is locked in , so to speak. how can i ask him, in a not too forward way to present me with a job offer with a salary included? is this best done in an email, in person? i feel clueless.	pavs27	/r/business/comments/5h9esz/how_to_ask_for_a_job_offer_from_an_informal/	1	1	0	0.6	1481229936.0

why don't companies make products customers want?	perhaps this question is unanswerable, or just varies between companies too much, but why do some companies not make products that the customers want? this thought is spurred by how samsung is getting rid of headphone jack on their upcoming galaxy s8 phone . first, i understand that sometimes, decisions made that go against what the overwhelming customers want sometimes are done for the long term view of what things will be....short term losses for the long term growth or profits. i also understand that sometimes, some products just aren't possible. like for example, many years ago, a laptop that was light and portable, while also being powerful , while also being within an x - y price range would have been an impossible product. what are reasons companies go against the wishes of what seems to be what the overwhelming existing customer base and other customers' wishes and make a product that people don't want, or dislike certain aspects of?

graduated 2 days ago, need advice on what opportunity i should choose	i graduated 2 days ago from the university of minnesota, carlson school of management with a degree in marketing. i have been working at a very large company since the beginning of summer. i started in one division, and i got recruited into another since i learned a software that is very necessary in the foodservice industry. i've been invited in for lunch to discuss future opportunities. here is where i need the advice my best friend's mother has been a realtor and appraiser for 30+ years and is incredibly successful. my friend just got his realtor's license and is working on his appraiser's license; he is due to make about $100,000 dollars in commissions from just after a year of being person number 2 in this small business. they both want me to come on and be person number 3. it's hard to get started in the business, but i'll make some hourly wages at first and ideally start to pull in serious commissions. the bulk of my cash flow will have to come from getting established, which who knows how long that takes. additionally, my family is becoming financially unstable, but i am living with my girlfriend at the university and she will have a position with a respectable company in a year and be able to support me while i get some serious traction. i wouldn't be throwing away my business degree because i've learned a lot in school and i need a four year degree anyways to get an appraiser's license. if i choose to join my friend and his mother's realty and appraisal business, i forego my opportunity at this big company to join their sales team and a 60-$70,000 dollar salary. i also have an conflict with joining a large business because i feel like there is an illusion of safety because you are employed at will, so you can be let go at any time and i know for a fact that there is restructuring taking place throughout the organization. any advice is appreciated and welcome, and thank you for taking the time.

why is company growth so important?	you see a lot of financial news talk about 'growth'. people get positive feelings from positive growth and negative feelings from negative growth. after all, your company may have earned $100 000 less than the year before, but you still earned $800 000. so why are people losing confidence? as i see it, growth statistics are a device designed to draw in investors, nothing more.

who actually pays the charge back on a credit card if it turns out later the card is stolen?	so i work at a bar that serves food and today was really busy. i had 4 people come in right when i opened and 2-3 people join them 10-20 mins later and others kept coming keeping me busy basically my whole shift non-stop. usually we ask for a credit card to keep tabs open and put a $1 hold that will fall off and give the customer their card back. because, it was so busy i didn't ask for a credit card until possibly up to 1 hour later. two of them offered a card, i took one persons card but i think i forgot to check id? the person's who card i placed a hold on was one of the people who joined a little after. they got in at around 12 pm and were there at least 3-3.5 hrs. at the end when it came time to close out the bill it was around $280 and people were attempting to use multiple cards to pay for the bill but some ended up giving cash and the whole bill was put on the card that had the hold on it that was probably 3+ hrs after putting the hold on the card and i didn't finalize the total purchase including the tip which was a little over 20% until 1-2 hours after charging the pre-tip amount and everything went through normally. they didn't order anything really high priced for food or drinks and didn't order any takeout. i just feel paranoid about if the card ends up being stolen...what happens and i physically swiped the card? i don't want to get fired anyone have any experiences with this?	marcus_tate	/r/business/comments/5sk4ia/who_actually_pays_the_charge_back_on_a_credit/	3	1	0	1.0	1486453421.0

eli5 what are business outcomes	hi, struggling to wrap my head around the concept of business and customer outcomes. for example, you have a website that is performing okish but there is desire to change information architecture and look & feel. however to get funding one would have to create a business case, which amongst other things outlines the benefits. my understanding of how this grows out is benefits --> outcomes --> outputs. now obviously in this example, the outputs are pretty tangible . however what would the outcomes of this be and how would that map to benefits. in my mind the outcomes would be along the lines improved customer experiences customers can find the information they need customers can solve their own problems reduced operating costs and in the benefits i could link each outcome to a benefit area e.g. $200k savings in call centre costs customer satisfaction survey up to positive 10% however is my understanding of outcomes correct ? or would i also have to include how each outcome contributed to the benefit? outcomes and benefits all seem a little bit intangible/subjective imo. if i have not explained myself well, i can expand if you have a specific question. are there any outcome register and benefits registers that i can look at to help understand the types of benefits large enterprises typically look for?	iam_willpower	/r/business/comments/5uw25e/eli5_what_are_desired_business_outcomes/	1	1	0	1.0	1487470124.0
my friend is getting screwed at his job and is going to be renegotiating soon. he's got no idea how to even approach the negotiations and i'm not much better. where do you start?	background small company, very profitable, growing fast. he does a pivotal job and the company would basically fail without him. he's salaried, gets commission on sales, and has a portion of the company and is going to be renegotiating his contract soon. the issue is that his two bosses/owners do absolutely nothing, get paid 3x as much as he does, and are using all the profits the business is making to funnel into their own side business that he's cut out of. he wants to invest in new developers and staff and make decisions about new hardware and they want to take every cent of profit after operating expenses and throw it at other bad ideas/failing companies of theirs. everyone knows he's pretty essential, although the bosses might not understand the full extent to which he is needed or everything he does. he came to me for advice because i renegotiate my contract every year, but mine is easy. i'm kind of in the same boat about being essential, but my company is much bigger and well managed, so i just ask for something reasonable and i get it no questions asked. this company is only 8 people and while it's a multi-million dollar company, there is a big difference in how things are handled and i'm not sure where he should start. does he take his contract and make changes and go in there and ask them to look it over and sign it? how do you even start asking for more power in a company when you really don't want more money and there aren't any defined positions to ask for. how does he start getting financial control without it coming off like he's threatening to leave? he's happy there, doesn't want to go off and work for someone else, but also the business is kinda stagnant and will fail in a few years if nothing changes anyway. any advice or pointing in the right direction if there's a better place for this discussion would be great! thanks!

modern resumes why your resume doesn't need to be boring	first and foremost, this is not blogspam. i'm actually writing this right from my browser into reddit, and i don't even run a blog. the reason i'm writing this is because of the many wrong things being taught in institutions of higher learning, resume creating is one of them they want you to think that there is one and only one way to make a resume, and this is completely false . i'd like to first give two types of resume examples modern < link , and boring on far right hand side of document. if you are still employed there, write present. directly underneath company will be your position in bold. directly under position will be your first bullet point. you need 3 to 5 bullet points per work experience. expand on eachwhat did you do/how did you do it/what was the end result or purpose? > the final section on a resume is a mandatory skills section detailing your computer skills, and any language skills you possess. this is where you can mention software like microsoft word, powerpoint, and so on. careful not to use the term microsoft office as that is a suite made of multiple programs. you must specify each software individually, along with your level of proficiency basic/moderate/intermediate/fully. > your skills section is not the place to mention soft skills such as communication, organization, etc. these must be specified with concrete examples within your experience section. did i make a comparison to thesis? i think i did. as someone who has interned for a human resources department, and been successfully hired multiple times, you would think that i would know how to make a resume. but my university doesn't want me to think that i do. they want me to defy the common logic of trying to stand out in a crowd of hundreds of applicants and do something insane the exact same thing as everyone else. what's even crazier is that i'm a business student, and one of the most crucial things they teach you in business school is that differentiation is one of the most important marketing tactics ever used. take laundry detergent for example. it is a famously used example of differentiation because laundry detergent is literally the exact same no matter what brand you pick. each laundry detergent product is almost identical. between gain, tide, snuggle, and the other 20 or so brands, they all have the exact same price, virtually identical ingredients, and indistinguishable results. but they differentiate themselves very differently from one another. can you imagine if laundry detergent brands were like traditional resumes? you're walking around looking at them and they all have the exact same price, the exact same black and white logos, the same ingredients, but all they have different about them is their name and the companies that produced them. the problem is that this wouldn't say nothing about the product and wouldn't allow anyone to make a great decision based on the difference is because there would be no differences. so why did this person decide to reject my resume, especially given the fact that i am attending a university in miami, which is widely regarded as one of the most modern and creative cities in the entire world? possibly on a power trip. the desire to control others and impart your own ideas on them is definitely a thrilling feeling, especially when you have legitimate power. stemming from another important concept learned in management is french and raven's bases of power. legitimate power is one of the power bases. as wikipedia correctly states, legitimate power comes from an elected, selected, or appointed position of authority and may be underpinned by social norms. in this case, the social norm is utilizing a traditional resume, and the appointed individual is the one who screens all the resumes on the university careers site. the university or the individual is using their legitimate power to enforce the social norm of traditional resumes, and making absolutely sure that students are following the exact format they want their students to. but is it justified? definitely not. you can give me all of the advice you want, but you have no right to dictate what kind of resume i use at the end of the day. say it with me now, folks the only person that should be making all of the important decisions regarding my resume should be me. in closing, modern resumes are every bit as successful and attractive as their traditional counterparts. i pity the hiring manager having to comb through a batch comprised entirely of traditional resumes, as i've been there/done that, and it was far less rewarding than reviewing the far more insightful modern resumes. plus, if youre in college, advice and tips should always be there if you need them, but now more than ever, we need individuals capable of thinking for themselves. if we start implementing a screening process for every aspect of students lives, we are going to end up with a workforce that is just as clueless as a pen of sheep roaming around. make your own decisions, and if you need advice, ask for it. thats the bottom line.		/r/business/comments/61u2ak/modern_resumes_why_your_resume_doesnt_need_to_be/	5	3	0	0.67	1490640181.0

engineer looking for advice on getting a full ride to mba	i have an engineering background and worked at major automotive companies before, then i got my master of finance degree from uiuc and switched into equity research. but recently i've decided i want to switch into private equity as i like the deal making process and it has been really hard to switch out. almost everyone i have interviewed with ultimately rejected me saying i dont have deal experience from banking. i feel like getting an mba would help tremendously to pivot from my current career path. but i dont have the money or the desire to take out loans to get it. i know major programs like harvard give full rides to their mba programs. i want to know if there is any strategy involved in getting in to a top program with full ride. what exactly should i say or do to position myself for a full ride at these schools. any help would be appreciated. thanks	johnnyboyfart	/r/business/comments/63dy2o/engineer_looking_for_advice_on_getting_a_full/	7	2	0	0.67	1491310816.0

my buddy has one last option before walking about from his home. advice?	hi all - sorry about the ridiculously long post. my close buddy is going through a situation where he's either going to have to walk away from his home, or to pay a $10,000 a month mortgage for a few years to get caught up and keep the home. i told him this would be a great place to get some input, so he emailed me the rundown of his situation below for me to post. if anyone has a few minutes to make it through this, i'd love to hear some thoughts to relay back to him. thanks! ______________________________________________________ i bought my home in late 2005 for $890k with $80k down and two loans . i refinanced once to get out of my adjustable rate neg am loan after 3 years and now have a 40-year fixed at 5% on the first. when the market corrected my home's value dropped as did my income. i depleted my savings trying to make my payments and reached a point where i could no longer afford to keep paying. with my home's value down to $650k at the time i couldn't sell the property and recoup my down payment. i attempted several times to get approved for a loan modification through countrywide, then bank of america with no success. stopped making payments in 2011 and haven't made payments since then trying to get a loan mod that offered principle forgiveness. because of the size of my 1st, i didn't qualify for hamp or any other programs. midway through this process my 2nd loan of $140k was forgiven. so now my total owed on the house is about $744k. my loan was then sold off to a trust and serviced through a small servicer which gave them an exception from the california homeowners bill of rights. in other words, when i'd submit a loan mod app to them they could deny me and give hardly any information behind why...they could simply just say that my debt-to-income ratio doesn't qualify and not show their calcs. i hired an attorney who was able to submit enough tros to fight off foreclosure and allow me to stay in the house while i went through this loan mod process. sidenote--around this time my fiance and i had a baby and are living in the home. in the end i made the decision to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy and tried to leverage the mortgage modification mediation program to have a 3rd party help negotiate my loan mod request with the loan servicer. during this process i have been making $4,500 good faith payments toward a bankruptcy trust that holds the money in escrow and if we work out a deal that goes toward what i owe. if we don't work out a deal i get that money back. i was somewhat misguided in thinking that if my numbers worked, this program would make them have to work with me. it wasn't until after that i learned that there's nothing that forces them to work with me and if they simply wanted to sell the property there was nothing ultimately stopping them. so now i have a bk on my record, and my only options are full reinstatement , deed-in-lieu where i'd get my monthly payments back , or i can try to pay back the arrears monthly over the next 5 years . my question to this group is this; should i walk from the property and hold only the $110k from not paying my mortgage i have saved + the $45k i'll get back or should i try to keep the property which is valued at somewhere between $980k-$1.1m, and make payments of approx $10k a month over the next 4 years. with my income, my fiance's income and 1 roommate we'd bring in, we can afford the $10k if we tighten our belts a bit, though it's definitely high. the comps show that the home can sell right now for $1-1.1m, however with the timing of the bk right now i wouldn't be allowed to try and sell the home. just don't have enough runway to do it in the next month when we have our final bk hearing. so the ultimate question is if it's worth it to pay those high payments for four years, which pay off the arrears as well as some of the principle, and then in 4 years i have the home with about $700k balance on the loan and a home that should be work at minimum $1m . current home condition is a fixer-upper but with nominal spend on renovations here and there could be modernized. i have family that can help do this work cheap. if we walked from the home i'd have $150k in my pocket, but we'd be renting in the range of $4k a month. so take my $150k and go rent, or leverage the ch 13 to pay off the arrears over 4 years and keep the home which likely will have at least $200-300k in equity after that 4 years, while risking a higher than ideal mortgage payment in a home that needs some work to get up to speed?

what do you think about this hobby food stall business idea?	i'd like your opinion on this idea. is the strategy, product mix, and economic viability sound? i was just at an art festival in ann arbor and i'm thinking about running a food stall at festivals and events on the weekends as a hobby. some of the vendors have a lot of overhead from their equipment. they have expensive equipment and high variable costs like food trucks, crepe making stations, and products that have lots of ingredients like taco bowls. so i was thinking that a good strategy would be to offer things that meet these criteria 1 utilize minimum equipment. preferably just a large grill. 2 a small number of relatively inexpensive ingredients. 3 products that are not preparation and serving labor intensive. 4 somehow tweek these basic foods so inexpensive ingredients have a trendy and appealing flair. this is the product mix i am currently contemplating. 1 bacon wrapped hot dogs. other than condiments its only a hot dog, bacon, and a bun. bacon is sort of a buzzword that catches people's attention. 2 lemonade. it is lemons, sugar, and water. there is a lot of competition because it is a common beverage at festivals, but it is cheap and easy to make. the only equipment is basically a large container to store it in. 3 corn on the cob. its super cheap. it only requires a grill. 4 thai coconut sticky rice with mango. this is just rice, sugar, coconut cream, and mango. when i was in thailand, they put those ingredients in a section of bamboo and cooked it. you peeled the bamboo away and ate the rice out of it. i would partially cook the rice in a large rice cooker. then put the rice, sugar and coconut cream in a tinfoil pouch and throw it on the grill. then open the pouch and throw chunks of mango in. possibly also top with a coconut cream/heavy cream/ sugar mix. this product mix would only require a large grill and a rice maker. it covers the categories of a savory meal, beverage, and dessert. all offerings are simple and not labor intensive. also, there are two relatively catchy, trendy foods bacon dogs and thai sticky rice. preparation aside, this could be done with very few employees. 1 to operate the large grill. 1 for the register. 1 to move things from the grill to customer. i thought this mix would be economical and would appeal to a large number of people. my girlfriend thinks that it is good to offer variety. i however think that variety will add too much cost and complexity. what do you think?

when is it safe to rely on an income that changes with the market	i am 26, married and make $34k-$39k yearly, depending on ot worked, my wife is 25 and makes $50k-$55k, depending on ot worked, and we live comfortably with this amount. i won't go into details about what the investment is, because last time i asked it was questioned on wether or not this was real, instead of answering the actual question. so my question is this, if i am to rely on an income that may raise or drop from week to week, and i would like to make at least as much money on a bad week as i am making at my current job now, i know without actual numbers that is a bit tough to answer, but is there a general rule of thumb, maybe something like make enough to be able to pay all bills for the month plus 10% more if it's a low week/month , or maybe have a weekly average of 3 times what you need to pay your bills 	Tipperton	/r/business/comments/6e0y7x/when_is_it_safe_to_rely_on_an_income_that_changes/	2	1	0	0.67	1496072553.0

planning to start a business with a friend; however, i'd rather move forward with the business alone. how to tell friend without harming friendship?	hey guys, so i came up with this idea for side business and have the experience in that business field to make it work; my problem is, i told my friend and decided he would like to join me, initially i thought cool it's gonna be fun. but moving forward, i feel like it is something i can and want to do alone because, well, i don't really need any help with it. between my friend and i, i have the excel, coding, marketing knowledge and over 5 years in this field of the business, my friend is new to the field, not very skillful in the requires areas or a people person at that, so he doesn't contribute much. he is making the design logo, but that's something i can get done for free. sorry if i am sounding selfish here, but i can't help but feel if the business is successful that i won't get a fair share. is there any way to tell my friend i'd rather do this alone without jeopardizing our friendship? thank you.

my wife recently has been showing interest in a company called prime my body. does anyone know about this company?	an acquaintance of my wife's recently started telling her about this cbd oil that he's started selling, and the company he's working for called prime my body. i joined her for a conference call a little while ago and we've been doing some research into the company. it seems like the products they sell are legitimately decent products, but it's the revenue system that worries me. it definitely strikes me as very pyramid scheme-y. you can go with just selling the product yourself, but it also has a system where you get 10% of the commissions that your affiliates sell. affiliates are people who you bring in to the company to also sell product. you also get a cut of what the people they bring in to the company sell, and so on, and so forth. just describing it like i did makes it seem painfully obvious that it's a pyramid scheme, but i wanted to get some outside opinions on the company before i jumped to conclusions. some google-fu turned up mixed results, but if anyone has had a run-in with this company or knows about it, i'd love some more information. website of the company, for those who want it	holyplankton	/r/business/comments/6l3cp4/my_wife_recently_has_been_showing_interest_in_a/	7	3	0	0.67	1499123263.0

how can online sales be causing low retail sales when all stores can simply up their online presence to make up for decreased brick-and-mortar sales?	many big retail stores are closing stores because people are supposedly buying more online than in actual stores. but this doesn't make much sense to me. if someone who usually shops at jc penny decides to buy online, why wouldn't he buy from jcpenny.com? if he moves on to amazon.com instead, then you can't blame amazon or any other online retailer. jc penny simply failed to adapt or it offered lower quality products than its online competitors. the blame should be on jc penny. however, does the data really show an increase in online sales that correlates inversely with the decrease in retail sales? i feel that if people are not buying in stores, then they are buying less overall because people still prefer to see and feel a product before buying, especially when it comes to clothes!! the people are buying more online seems like a weak explanation to hide a decrease in retail sales.	b0302	/r/business/comments/6lh7y0/how_can_online_sales_be_causing_low_retail_sales/	3	0	0	0.5	1499291044.0

i'm 17 with a business idea - what do i need to be doing to make it a reality?	hi reddit! i've had an idea for a store for a while now and i would love to actually be able to pursue the idea. i have another year of education which gives me some time to research the idea, find out the pitfalls and get some general tips for running a business. the idea for the store isn't the most original - we'd sell items from books, from movies, anything with an online following really. i'd be selling items such as pop vinyls, their respective books if they have some but also items from creators an etsy if they were able to provide them to a consistent standard. for example, take harry potter. the location of the store would likely be in a local shopping centre, there's a few units available to rent with some being there a while. i'll accept any and all advice on what i need to be doing but i do have some questions - obviously selling items from say, the harry potter series, there's going to be certain things which are copyrighted/trademarked. what do i need to research to avoid any issues? if we were selling an item from an etsy creator which used the deathly hallows symbol, would we need to ensure they have permission to use the symbol first? - how would i go about getting the funds to start up this business? a business loan seems like it may be an issue due to my age, is there anything i can do to improve my chances?

how can someone 'squeeze' into a specific market?	i want to invest and sell in a niche market. sometimes a price for an item could significantly increase/decrease but it's very hard to predict. i'm not sure how people really get into the business, because you need to be able to find a distributor that will sell at lower prices for you to make profit after selling them. however, you need an established e-commerce/brick and mortor store. so how does someone even make profit if we can only really resell items we bought off for example amazon and resold them on ebay? the prices are so close together i'm hardly breaking even. it seems impossible unless you have a lot of capital to begin with...

why does it seem like this subreddit hates business?	i searched for a business subreddit because i wanted to tap into the pulse of the reddit community's business acumen. i also wanted to participate in lively discussion about fundamentals, market risks, industry successes and failures, etc. i have surfed this subreddit for 3 days and not subscribed yet because, oddly enough, this subreddit seems to actually be an anti-business subreddit. almost every popular post is about the failure of some business or an anecdote of cronyism. then in the comments, instead of talking about what went wrong and how to fix it, or how the market will respond, or which competitor will take advantage of the situation, all i get is more bashing of the company and usually of capitalism or business in general, and sometimes bashing customers and citizens themselves! many comments are used as an opportunity to espouse unrealistic ideology as if most people here have never even worked for a business before, or even taken business/financial classes. is this just because of my limited view from the last few days or is this business as usual around here? p.s. i realize this post might piss off lots of defensive people. i am not necessarily talking about you individually. you probably know if you are the kind of person i am talking about. i am just wondering if most subscribers also notice this problem or if it's not usually an issue.

starting a business venture with friends and need some advice!	what is a normal/fair percentage of a business to receive in a partnership for helping start a business when you're not contributing money to the business venture, but doing most the work? i'm starting a new business venture with a couple friends who are going to sell antler as chew toys for dogs and they want me to help them start and run it. they haven't worked out a ton of the details but they want to do it as a partnership and give me a certain percentage of the company. when i asked what percentage they had in mind they said 15-20% but that they hadn't thought about it a whole lot, they were just kind of throwing the whole idea out there. i think if i were to not help build the business - basically just run the website and etsy shop - then 15-20% would be fair, but if i'm going to be reaching out to collaborators, coming up with additional product ideas, and really helping build this business from the ground up, i think that's too low. if the latter is what they want and expect from me i would think 35-45% would be fair, they would mostly be providing the money and then i'd be doing the rest. one of their other employees would be handling the advertising because that is something i'm not great at. i have literally zero experience in this so i would really appreciate some insight on this from people who are in partnerships! thank you!!	iwaslostbutnowisee	/r/business/comments/6rnkfn/starting_a_business_venture_with_friends_and_need/	4	4	0	0.84	1501881405.0

boss problems. getting pretty bad. need advice. 	i'll try to keep it as short as possible. i'm also going to be pretty vague in my job description for the sake of anonymity. my boss and i do not get along. i know that happens everywhere, but this boss of mine is a very very bad person. she has attempted to falsify commission reports to take commission bonuses from me and my coworker. she wrote me up in march with a list of things that i did wrong, but in reality, 5 of 6 things listed were not even my doing. i don't want to sound like i'm infallible- i definitely make plenty of mistakes. but what i was written up for truly wasn't my fault. next, she recently had been caught blatantly lying to a client regarding price estimates and contract dates. another guy i work with reported this to hr. my boss's boss, an area vp, called said coworker and made excuses for my boss. this vp said things like, i'm sure she just didn't know the details of the contracts. it had to be an honest mistake. apparently that went on for about 10 minutes until my coworker realized it was a lost cause. finally, today, i get written up again. this time it's because she said i was blatantly disrespectful during a recent heated discussion her and i had where i confronted her about her attempts to steal commissions. i just don't know what to do here other than just find a different job. i feel like my boss has set a goal to watch me fail. there are many more examples, but i just don't have time to list them all. what do i do here? it has been proven that contacting hr will not solve the problem. i work in a small office where i'm 15 feet from this woman every day, so approaching her is pretty much out of the question unless i want to create a terrible work environment for myself. any and all advice would be appreciated.	the_tza	/r/business/comments/6uo8r2/boss_problems_getting_pretty_bad_need_advice/	17	9	0	0.8	1503136350.0

starting a new business and need advice on allocating ownership and cost sharing with partner	i had an idea for a new smartphone app. i did basic research to see if there was an app like it already and there was not. i started building the app, which requires a server and the apps themselves . i mentioned it to a salesman friend of mine who loved the idea and had some good ideas on app functionality. so far, i have done 250+ hours of research, coding, and testing and have an early beta ready. the app itself has a user version and a service provider version. i want to partner with this person for two reasons first, his encouragement pushed me to get this far. second, he is a successful salesman which will be important, since if we can not get service providers to sign-up/buy the service the business will not be successful. my questions are; what percentage of the startup should i offer him, and do we split costs the same way or can we do cost more on a 50/50 basis?	vpniceguys	/r/business/comments/6vzzq4/starting_a_new_business_and_need_advice_on/	4	0	0	0.5	1503682367.0
how to catch employee stealing	i have an employee i've had for years, about 8 years. he's gotten raises and his job is relatively simple it's all paperwork office work nothing manual or labor intensive. i'm a glass company so compared to what my guys do he has it made pretty well since he gets paid better than the skilled laborers. anyway he has been getting very suspicious of accounts. i monitor all accounts from my end i can see all money coming in and going out. what gets to me is he is so motivated to making sure no one steals hours from us when that's not even his job. he'll tell me 3 weeks in advance when he wants to go on vacation which gives him a perfect amount of time to cover his trail if he needs to. he sees all money coming in and going out of the company. im very busy and he is aware of this. i'm going to hire and external accountant to start monitoring accounts secretly but i was wondering if there is anything else i can do to catch him without being too obvious. i have not noticed any money missing but there are ways to do anything if you try. anyone have any ideas?	electrictrix32	/r/business/comments/6w57r0/how_to_catch_employee_stealing/	10	0	0	0.43	1503749407.0

how to raise seed money	i am in the process of launching a new startup and i was wondering if people had any tips for raising seed investment? i have exhausted my own means and need to raise quite a substantial amount of money before i am able to start generating revenue. i am looking to enter a new market, with a unique and patentable product/service, and extremely high profit margins due to the low operating costs. the product/service i am looking to launch is highly scalable, and although i am hoping to launch nationally at first there is a great deal of scope to target the international market. however to do this requires development of the product by a 3rd party supplier, something that is far beyond my skill level to do otherwise and extremely expensive. so far i have worked towards creating a brand image, have a full 5 year cash forecast with both conservative and expected turnovers, and have applied for investment from local grants, and major venture capital firms however we are only a team of two and have exhausted our own capital. does anyone have any advice on how to get attention from potential investors?

how much of an equity gap should co-founders starting at same time have? .	so we started working on this business just over a month ago, but due to my business co-founder wanting 58-60% equity because he is leading the business charge of this one , but i'm the tech co-founder who came up with the original idea and have been contributing to the hosting skills and cost, suggesting new features , fixing ui issues/typos made by the other founder on the site and physically and social media marketing this a lot. business co-founder wants 58-60% equity. right now we registered the company with a 50/50 split. we've both poured about $500 each into this so far. he said i have 4 days to decide whether to take 40-42% equity or he will split ways and form another company with the same idea. what do i do? are there any legalities i should be aware of that can happen if a co-founder has < 50%? namely around share distribution. he said we will still have board seats each. . it's important for both of us to be happy. he wants 58-60% stake now because he believes he is doing more work now than me and definitely thinks he will be doing way more in 2-10 years taking up the tough managerial positions like ceo. is this reason enough to warrant giving up my current 50% ownership? we have applied for accelerators too, and expect to get into one early next year which take 7.5-10% equity, and he said we will evenly contribute equity for accelerators between us, but he seems only happy if we have a 16-20% equity gap between us. he has been doing more business admin and a bit of wp work than me, but i have a long persistence in tech and can spend as much time as i need to solve a technical issue . i have a feeling he is jumping the gun too fast on this one, but we seem like a good fit personally, we've known each other for about 3 years as casual friends, but have been spending more business time with each other in this past 6 months or so. we're both huge fans of hbo's silicon valley! equity is forever, dynamic changes in work not so much. we've also both left our full-time jobs to work on this. i've advocated remote working from home 1-2 days a week but he seems against that for now. one accelerators' hours for the first week is 8am-8pm next year. but startup life should be flexible enough to accommodate as long as you can find your flow and execute your work. i know the environment has a lot of influence but also travel time does as well. he is very adamant on meeting in the city to work on this 5 days a week, for like 12 hours a day, even though we both live 1 hour away from the city in opposite directions. we've had brief discussions of flatsharing closer to the city, but not sure if he's totally into that option. ps he seems to have a stack of other ideas he has thought of but not executed , but sees potential in this one, we both do. we seem to be tracking with some solid networking progress so far. he didn't really discuss with me about being ceo, but it was just implied since he has a business degree and i have an it one. he seems to be doing more business side of the work, while also contributed to a wp site. i have been bouncing ideas off to him as well and helping networking and fix issues with the site. i think his biggest gripe is my commitment to turn up 5 days a week for 12 hours at the library rather than work remotely a few days a week. we never had to do a shareholder's agreement contract when we registered the company, so i'm still here thinking is that 50/50 share split even legally valid? we just put 50/50 shares split on the government's body which handles company registrations. but for non-compete he says we'll have one in our shareholder's agreement coming up if i agree to 40-42%. is this idea theft? . he has said i can be easily replaced... / . we spoke to a basic lawyer for free 1 off consultation, but he wasn't of much help. honestly that was like just 3 weeks ago and we were asking the lawyer legal questions about our startup, not about this co-founder equity split since he only brought up this conversation literally last week and he has been non stop lecturing me about it, calling me up 5-6 times a day with like 30min-2 hour phone calls. thanks! some good resources i came across namely it takes 7 to 10 years to build a company of great value. small variations in year one do not justify massively different founder equity splits in year 2-10. 	xc3llerator	/r/business/comments/788xa6/how_much_of_an_equity_gap_should_cofounders/	4	3	0	0.81	1508776375.0

how do i value the business of my convenience store?	hi all, i am selling my freehold shop. downstairs is a convenience store and upstairs is a small flat. i have a buyer interested, a guy who knows my shop well. we have been talking for a while and he has seen a few months worth of till reports. his suggestion to buy my shop is as such we agree a price for the business. then that's it. then a surveyor will come in and check the building value and we take that as given, that is the final price for the shop. his reasoning being he doesn't want to pay a fixed asking fee incase he ends up overpaying for the business or the building. this is fair enough and probably the most professional way to go about the sale. so in order to make the most money, i need to make sure my business value is very high. i have read a few ways and one common way seems to be that you take the weekly turnover and then multiply it by 10. this is the value of the business. how does this work? why 10? why not 12 for 12 months of the year or something? an idea i had was that we calculate the gross profit for the year. i.e profit just from sales, not including any deductions of wages etc. i then multiply this by 1.5. what this is saying is, in one year, i make x amount. if you pay 1.5 times that amount, i am saying that you will earn the money back for the shop in 1 and a half years. that's a good amount of time to make back a large sum of money. if i do it this way, it nearly doubles by value, compared to just doing weekly turnover x 10. so how do you normally go about valuing shops? what are ways i should look out for that might drop my business value or that might increase my value?	claret_n_blue	/r/business/comments/7ax0x3/how_do_i_value_the_business_of_my_convenience/	3	7	0	0.82	1509880437.0

how to access a website offline	hey sub! visiting from /small business and seeking some advice solving a problem. also, the methods that google did give did not help much. thanks for the help problem solving my friend's work deals with customers in china. her goal is to find a way that a salesman could sit down for tea with a customer and use the website as a way to present what they do, give examples of what they do, etc. powerpoint format is not an option since it is sequential, they need something that allows navigation such as a website template. because of internet regulations in china, the main obstacle is that they cannot simply bring up the website at a convenient coffee shop and have the client log onto the website later. they would also like a way for the client to take the website with them after the meeting, such as a file on a flashdrive. i have gotten interested in this problem and am here to seek advice. what's the best format? can she download the website as a file and then give that file to a client on a hard drive? not sure what the best step is.		/r/business/comments/7caxg0/how_to_access_a_website_offline/	4	3	0	0.68	1510433544.0

what to do when customer refuses to pay? ontario, canada.	over the course of this past summer i have been working with a contractor that has been remodeling an old church into a residence. i am a mason and when he needs that type of work done i am called in to complete the necessary task. once done i submit my bill to the home owner and he pays. everything has been fine until now. i completed a task and submitted my bill. a month went by with numerous attempts with both me and the general contractor trying to contact him, and he would not contact me. i finally sent an e-mail which said i would take alternative measures to recoup my money if not contacted by 10.11.2017. he did contact me and set up a meeting on 12.11.2017 to discuss deficiencies with my work. i agreed to meet with him and did. when we met he addressed an issue he had with some of my mortar joints being too big and wanted them fixed. being that it is and old church, the way they were built in those times had varying mortar joints sizes and that i was blending to match the rest of the structure. he didn't care and wanted them fixed to his liking to which i said i would come and do if that's what he wanted. at this point he brought up a part of the job that i had completed months prior, that i have been paid for with never one compliant, that it was done wrong. i explained that what he was talking about was the initial plan but that he had changed that plan and wanted it done another way which is why it was like like. he disagreed. there were also materials bought and paid for as well that have been sitting on a pallet covered from the elements that he said were now garbage and he wanted taken off the bill. i explained that not only were the materials still usable, but that as he already paid for them, they belonged to him and how they were stored was his responsibility and not mine. i also explained to him that sometime in mid july his wife was to be giving me a blueprint in which those materials were to be used and that to date i still have not received the blueprint which is why they are still where they are. we argued about these issues for a few minutes before he told me to leave to which i stopped talking and immediately left. as i was leaving i did say that i would put a lien on his house if i was not paid. he told me he had a fleet of lawyers and that he would file a lawsuit against me, i'm not sure what about though? i am wondering what the best course of action is to take in recovering what i am owed? the amount is a little more than $1800.00. do i place a lien on the property, take it to small claims court, put the amount into collections, or is there another option? please help if you can.

business idea and advice 	hi everyone, i have a business idea but not sure whether options might be a better fit in my scenario. background info i want to bring in a pet related item from north america to asia specifically to sell either online or to stores that sells similar category items. however i am unsure which two options better suits my situation . 1.contact the company that makes the product and ship it to the port in taiwan? patent the design then sell it online and to pet store? again, i am unsure the necessary steps to make this happen. since the factory that makes the item is in california and tennessee, should i contact a logistic company to help me import it to taiwan? how much would the costum, duty, and shipping cost? get the item and create a metal moulde, patent it, get it to a factory to produce it via plastic injection then sell it online and to pet stores. 2.the second option seems more feasible to me as i have never done this before, and feels more safe as i can control how much product i should manufacture. i am worried if i go with option 1 i would end up with too much stock on my hand and with the addition cost of the import tax and shipping the end product would cost way too much and there would be no market. please let me know if anyone has any advice on this situation. any advice and greatly appreciated. best regards, fatbroccolii	FatBroccolii	/r/business/comments/7davyx/business_idea_and_advice_usa_taiwan/	4	3	0	0.8	1510817807.0

advice on an software company trying to send a dodgy contract to debt collectors in california 	i'm looking for insight on how debt collections agencies work in california, specifically for business debt related to a questionable contract. my lawyer is on vacation for the holidays so i'm hoping to get some initial insight. i cross-posted to /r/debt and /r/legaladvice, but please let me know if there's anywhere else i should try. tl;dr software company belatedly informs me that last year's contract with my company has automatically renewed in a way that violates my state's laws . per our lawyer, we informed them that we didn't intend to pay for the renewal since we are not using the service and that we were not properly notified of the automatic renewal. now they're threatening to send us to a debt collector. ----- setup - in late 2016 my company entered into a contract with a software service provider. the term of the contract was specified as 1 year. - in late summer this year, the company reached out to see if we wanted to renew and/or update our plan. - we told the sales rep that we haven't been using the full feature set that this software offers, and so we were considering moving to another system, but that we were still investigating. - a few weeks before the end of our initial 1-year contract, we told the software company that we wished to cancel. the problem - at this point, the company told us that our contract had automatically renewed 60 days before the actual term was up, and that it wasn't possible to cancel . - at no point during our months of conversations did our rep indicate that the contract was automatically going to renew. all communications led us to believe that he wanted us to renegotiate and re-sign. - the auto-renewal term wasn't even in the document we signed. at the very bottom of the contract we signed, there is tiny text that says by signing this we agree to abide to the terms & conditions. the terms & conditions themselves weren't included in the contract, but were a link to a web page. - the t&cs webpage appears to be updated regularly, and no notice is provided when they change. the company won't even confirm that the auto-renewal term was there when we signed. - our lawyer informed us that this type of practice is against the law in our state . however, the jurisdiction of the contract is canada . - per our lawyer's advice, we informed the company that we did not intend to pay as they had entered us into the contract unethically. we have removed all our data from their platform and have not used it since the end of our original term. - we've been ignoring subsequent invoices. situation now this week, the company informed us that they were sending our invoices to a debt collection agency. i have never dealt with any debt collections agencies before, and i don't know exactly how they work. obviously i don't want any dings on either my personal or business credit. however, this seems ridiculously unethical to me, and again, it violates the law in my state. the total contract is low enough that any legal action they might take against us would be in small claims, which frankly doesn't seem worthwhile for a cross-country lawsuit. however, this company is much bigger than mine, and it has appears to have access to extensive legal resources. my questions - would a ca debt collector even pursue something like this? does anyone have experience dealing with debt collectors based on such an odd situation? am i screwed? - secondly, what are the potential implications for a small business being sent to debt collection? how would it impact my business? ------ please note that, as a business owner, i fully respect the value of contracts and, before this incident, have never been behind payment for any bill, partner, or vendor . i understand that the ultimate life lesson here is to read contracts more thoroughly. however, i find this particular situation to be so ridiculous that i am looking for a sanity check. any insights would be very much appreciated. thank you!	crappy_client	/r/business/comments/7kyhgy/advice_on_an_software_company_trying_to_send_a/	1	4	0	0.67	1513738362.0

can someone explain what gain sharing is and why it is being taken out of my pay?	hi there, /r/business. i'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but it seems to be the logical place to me. i've worked for my company for the past four years. not great, but it made ends meet and i've made headway into finally taking on full-time this season. i received my first ft paycheck, with 80 hours and about $1.50/hr raise, and notice i made significantly less than when i would take on extra shifts and use pto to hit 80. upon inspecting the breakdown, i saw before taxes there was a $220 deduction from my pay under gain sharing. no one at my company knows what it is , my management never opted me in for such a thing when i took on the position, calling payroll sends me to e-mail our now outsourced payroll department, and i fear that i'm getting screwed by the company and i will never see the money i earned. can someone here with better knowledge of business dealings tell me what exactly gain sharing is and how i go about seeing my hard-earned pay?

 how do i help my parents relocate their business to a new state when their best form of gaining new clientele is by referrals?	my parents want to move from pa to va, closer to my sister and i, but my dad is a small business owner who has built his glass company from absolutely nothing 30 years ago. he is very emotional about moving his business, although he really wants to since he has no family nearby and they are getting older. the business is glass, but the main work is doing high quality frameless shower glass doors and enclosures. most of his clients are by word of mouth and he drives up to 300 miles from his town near philly to give people the shower doors of their dreams. problem 1- moving and starting over. how do we build traction fast in a new place? problem 2- hes getting older and cant do most of the back breaking work that is involved with carrying heavy doors. i want to convince him to hire guys, whats the best way to approach this and hire the right people that will be trustworthy and maintain high standards? thanks in advance for your advice	gadgetbomb	/r/business/comments/7lp6pp/need_advice_how_do_i_help_my_parents_relocate/	7	5	0	0.73	1514043325.0

i need advice on giving the hotel i work for a breath of fresh air.	i am the guest services manager for a 3 star hotel and business has gone down significantly compared to other hotels in the area. i try to stay competitive with prices. most hotels are $20-50 higher than us, but they also have more up-to-date rooms and amenities than we do. our carpeting and furniture are easily 20 years old. we keep it very clean, but the style is still dated. unfortunately, our corporate office doesn't see updating our hotel as a priority. i would like to try new things to bring in more business, despite not having the latest in hotel furnishings. other hotels are filling up while we are struggling to meet 50% occupancy. does anybody have advice on how to do this? i'm open to anything, really. i've tried sending outreach letters to local businesses offering them a pretty low rate for corporate stays as well as offering trades to other hotels for free rooms. it just doesn't seem to be working. thanks		/r/business/comments/7mw8l4/i_need_advice_on_giving_the_hotel_i_work_for_a/	4	4	0	0.75	1514573905.0
will these skills help me on the job market?	tl;dr should i stay in a masters program to learn certain stats skills, or would those not transfer over well into the business world? to quit the masters and find a job, or stick it out? i graduated about 18 months ago with a ba in international relations, german, and russian. i worked at an apple store for about a year, then decided i wanted to go back to school. i started a phd program in political science. now that i'm in it, i really am a. sick of political science, and b. sick of being in school. so currently i'm thinking about graduating in 18 months with a ma and just getting a job after that. or simply dropping out and getting a job. my struggle is this while the political science stuff may not be so useful in getting a job, i think i may be learning some skills that may be. skills that make me think i should stick around for the master's include econometric analysis , time series analysis/forecasting, generalized linear modeling/maximum likelihood estimation, proficiency in r and python, bayesian statistical methods, etc. would these skills look favorable to companies when i put myself on the job market? i know a lot of it probably depends on what kind of job i'd be applying for , but i just don't know if it's worth sticking around for the ma just for these skills, or if it's not worth it.	tcush89	/r/business/comments/7mxhqg/will_these_skills_help_me_on_the_job_market/	2	6	0	0.87	1514585988.0

how restricted are you to charging a client a price different to what they expect?	i'm a freelancer in web dev. i'm looking for some 3rd perspective opinions as i'm not too sure on what path to take. i told a client over the phone a price range for the product i'm selling, which i regret as i charged him less than i usually do. i told him the price could change depending on complexity and other factors, but as he wanted something simple i feel like he was hinting at that it would be at the lower end of the price range. this is about half of what i usually charge. would it be wrong if i charged him the higher end of the price range . i technically did say it could be this much, so i'm just not sure how he would take it. any suggestions?

sms customer mass texting with keywords what am i looking for?	this is for a large scale emergency notification system in a large university. the problem we are having is during power outages the building occupants want immediate notifications so that they can come in and check on their research. i have only seen these type of services used for large companies for sales and such, so i figured that this would be a good place to ask. we would need to have individual lists for each building because we have a massively complex electrical distribution system and any given outage may affect only a small section of campus. we are developing a system to identify the specific buildings, and we have a 24/7 call center that will send out the messages. the scope would be probably 15 buildings each with a separate list, probably around 5000 or so subscribers in total, but usually only 3 - 5 buildings lose power and 1 - 2000 messages would need to be sent in a batch. i am thinking of sending a power outage occurred at xx xx and a follow up stable power has been restored standardized message. we have a power event 5 - 7 times a year so it is infrequent, but usually several hundred thousand dollars in research is lost and we are trying to minimize that. i want users to subscribe or stop themselves. what services should i start looking at? any to avoid? what features made a system like this work/not work for your business? thanks!!		/r/business/comments/7prw2c/sms_customer_mass_texting_with_keywords_what_am_i/	2	0	0	0.5	1515709640.0

past acquaintance wants to know my supplier. how do i say no without it sounding like f-off! 	 background i have a hobby business making a specific soil for a specific gardening hobby . half the soil is made of a component you can only purchase in bulk from the manufacturer or vendors in the trade. not home depot, garden centers, or soil/sand suppliers. i purchase it by the cubic yard, sift it by hand to get the right particle size, and store the sifted component in 80 cubic feet of dry storage containers. just so you know i perform a value-added service and have capital invested in sifting/storage equipment. the finished soil is sold locally and at trade events. i can have anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 in sales each year. enough to cover hobby costs and business expenditures and keep the wife calm and supportive. my customers like the product and refer me to their friends. the problem someone who has written to me on facebook asking hey bill i have a truck and trailer. you told me a few years back that there are stone yards that will sell me in bulk? if he asks around, he can find out the name of the company from other people in the hobby. it's not the biggest secret. i just don't want to be the one to tell him the company name. if he's looking to purchase that much supply, he is likely looking to sell it raw or as mixed soil. i know if i tell him, he'll follow-up with the specifics of how to set up the purchase and process the component. it's not just show up, buy it, bag it, sell it. i have a process, and i learned it through experience. over the years, i've had days where i drive 100 miles to the plant, only to be turned around for not doing/having something specific. i also know how to minimize product waste. i didn't go through all that grief to streamline the process for someone i hardly know! it sounds like he wants me to help him become my competition. it's not like he's a friend . i know he's into the hobby, but i don't see him at enough meetings and events for me to give him much respect. how do i tell him no without sounding like an asshole? i'm thinking of replying with a change in direction i have plenty of that in stock. i'll be happy to set you up with just about any volume. how much do you need?

starting 1st business where to start	salty rant i'd rather die than work for another corporation. my first two real jobs both ended in layoffs and left me scrambling to find work. ive realized that many people in upper management are cutthroat and are willing to lie & manipulate to get what they want. this isnt how we are meant to live, slaving away the vast majority of the day for people who dont care about you and who are willing to discard you on a whim. so now thats over i have 8 months to come up plan to generate income and execute before the funds run out. id like to start my own business. what are the steps/processes involved in starting a business to minimize the chance of failure or wasting time/money? a to b most efficiently. should i be writing a business plan? market research? i would guess the first step would be identifying strengths and areas where you can add value right? my background is in mechanical engineering, im decent at cad , passion for finance & enjoy woodworkingnot sure how to monetize any of these. my first idea is that it may be better to start a service business first because that seems like it would be easier to generate income in the short term . service that seem appealing are carpet cleaning, pressure washing, car washing. the ultimate goal is to eventually have rental properties. im not really sure where to start. any thoughts from people who have already been through this process before would be greatly appreciated. thanks. background 27 years old, no debt, no job, 8 months to figure this out.		/r/business/comments/7x48u4/starting_1st_business_where_to_start/	3	0	0	0.5	1518471349.0
i need advice on this business idea	so i've had this idea myself, but it was recently given a new energy by my father. i'm moving back to a state i used to live in where real estate is very cheap. and i used to have the idea of buying a dirt cheap home. making repairs/renovations myself, then renting out the properties. i've always had an interest in this but i haven't actually thought about going for it until my father got involved. he called me and told me he wants to do it. he has a couple of thousand for a down payment. but his credit is horrendous. that's where i come in. my credit is good, and getting better each month. i'm also a part of a credit union which i have an auto loan with. that i've never been late to pay. so he wants to go into business with me. he'll put down the downpayment, and i use my credit to secure a loan. and we get some kind of open loan to buy houses. something like 100k$ loan. we buy a few houses for 20k each, fix them and rent them out. he's very handy and knows how to do renovations. and i'm not experienced but also know my way around a home and doing some renovations. does this sound like a good idea to go for? what kinds of loans would be best for this?	friendlymountainman	/r/business/comments/7xvtut/i_need_advice_on_this_business_idea/	6	5	0	0.86	1518749789.0

5 types of bad bosses that makes employees want to quit	bad managers, unfortunately, seem to fly under the radar. 55 percent of respondents stated they didn't report the bad manager to leadership. employees avoid confrontation and instead move companies. the negative impact a bad manager can have on an employee, both with productivity and emotionally. organizations with the best employee video communication in the world still lose valuable workers and mid-level managers due to terrible bosses. here are four archetypes of bad bosses that send talented employees running for the hills and torpedo the best employee retention efforts. here are the 5 types of bad bosses that make employees want to quit companies 1 narcissist these managers care about self-promotion more than the staff. they take all the credit for an accomplishment and point the finger when things go wrong. these boss will take credit for many things you work hard on, but others will eventually realize your boss is not doing the heavy lifting. if you are happy with your current role and want to stay at the company, humour this type of boss. to satisfy these bosses, keep them informed on all communication you have with their boss and your clients. thank them constantly for their help and advice. 2 superman > leaders who don't listen will eventually be surrounded by people who have nothing to say. ~andy stanley this breed of manager thinks the organisation revolves around them. this trap includes making all of the decisions solos, ignoring feedback you don't like and taking the credit. letting your ego get ahead of you and think you know it all is a sure path to failure. showing some vulnerability allows you to strengthen relations with your team. admit what you dont know. 3 the iron fist arrive at 8 01 instead of 8 00? this boss is already writing a report. take three bathroom breaks instead of two in a day? the iron fist is rewriting the rules to prevent that as we speak. when the iron fist is in charge, employees will work exactly as the boss prefers whether or not its reasonable or practical. a little flexibility and trust in an employee go a long way. conversely, telling employees that you trust them so little they cant be five minutes late once in a while is a great way to turn your office into a breeding ground of resentment. very few bosses show empathy towards their team members and this helps improve overall morale and performance. 4 ghost these bosses say they care about employee development but are never there for coaching and support. they aren't responsive via phone, and emails from them are brief and sporadic. they don't give frequent feedback and are rarely around to answer questions. lack of direction can be frustrating, but its a chance for you to excel. you have the autonomy to prove you can execute on well-thought-out decisions without micromanagement. be resourceful and find different ways to get the information and answers. if you get no responses from one boss, find someone else to greenlight your decision. as a result, you can build relationships with people outside of your immediate teams. 5 king kong these type of managers possess a superiority complex and like to draw the distinction between management and staff. when some managers reach the top, they immediately forget where they came from. its dreadful to work under a manager whos more worried about pushing their weight around. great leaders dont talk down to their employees or make them feel inferior. they respect everyone and make everyone feel important. a bad boss creates fear and makes work drudgery. studies show having a bad boss increases a workers chance of having a heart attack by as much as 60 percent due to the stress and anxiety caused by unfeasible targets, lack of support, unfair practices and threats of punishment. the world is littered with managers but there are very few leaders. employees long for bosses who are leaders.

pensions when are they going to be killed off?	it's plaguing dozens of companies, not to mention states, the boomers will retire at some point and keep getting paid, most of them with annual increases. while those stepping into their roles will get neither a raise, nor a pension, just a 401k.....would it be viable for companies to start buying out these pensions? perhaps by offering shares, or small cash percentage with an option to reinvest in a 401k type vehicle? or are the pensions too valueable to the hedge funds who manage them? it seems to me that it's not sustainable and needs to be addressed befor the boomers get to fuck everybody one last time 	daileyjd	/r/business/comments/7zxz7d/pensions_when_are_they_going_to_be_killed_off/	11	9	0	0.65	1519492791.0

things you should give up if you want to be successful	successful people don't make excuses. they get work done and don't let petty circumstances come in the way of achieving their goals. when most people think of success, their mind wanders to the healthy habits and characteristics they need to incorporate into their life. there are certain things that are universal, which will make you successful if you give up on them, even though each one of us could have a different definition of success. becoming a great giver upper is essential to succeeding at the things that are important to you. give up the stuff that is holding you back from becoming a great designer. 1. stop saying yes to everything successful people know that in order to accomplish their goals, they will have to say no to certain tasks, activities, and demands from their friends, family, and colleagues. in the short-term, you might sacrifice a bit of instant gratification, but when your goals come to fruition, it will all be worth it. 2. stop blaming others for your mistakes > the day you stop blaming others is the day you begin to discover who you are truly. this is likely the most important lesson that you need to learn. you are going to make many mistakes if you attempt anything remarkable. you are going to hurt people, create disappointment and cause confusion and chaos. the best way to make these right is to apologize. the best way to apologize is simply to say, i'm sorry. no excuses. no drawn-out reasons. just powerful words and an attitude of sincerity. and when you do, the results are mind-blowing. you solve problems faster, win the confidence of your clients better and make yourself more accessible to everyone around you. 3. stop expecting life to be fair > life is never fair and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not. - oscar wilde stop pretending like you're the only one who has bad, unexpected circumstances happen to them. a lot of things that we like to call unfair are real outcomes of the decisions that we have made in the past. we make risky decisions and then cry unfair when our gamble doesn't turn out with us hitting the jackpot. that's unfortunate because there is a valuable lesson that could be learned if we stopped pouting and started listening. 4. taking rather than giving from a scarcity perspective, helping other people hurts you because you no longer have the advantage. from an abundance perspective, there is not only one pie, but an infinite number of pies. if you want more, you make more. thus, helping others actually helps you because it makes the system as a whole better. it also builds relationships and trust and confidence. 5. give up the fixed mindset do not let yourself believe that your intelligence and talent are fixed virtues and that your success in life will be based solely on your traits. successful people know this. they invest an immense amount of time on a daily basis to develop a growth mindset, acquire new knowledge, learn new skills and change their perception so that it can benefit their lives. remember, who you are today, its not who you have to be tomorrow. > in the fixed mindset, when you fail; you're failure - in the growth mindset, when you fail; you're learning. 6. don't multitask contrary to what people believe, your brain cannot focus on too many activities at once. multitasking splits your focus and you end up doing yourself a disservice as you can't commit your full energy and commitment to even a single activity. > multitasking means screwing up several things at once. 7. following the crowd > don't follow the crowd, let the crowd follow you. - margaret thatcher idiots do stupid things. sometimes a lot of idiots do the same thing together. the thing you are missing out on are the results of idiot behaviour. many times your industry is heading is a good direction and it feels safe to follow the leader. but instead of achieving greatness you get the success leftovers of everyone else in your industry who gets to the finish line first. take the time to go your own way. have an idea of your own. dedicate yourself to pursuing your own brand of greatness. 8. give up fixing your weaknesses we live in a society that emphasizes the need to be well-rounded. successful people hardly ever tick that box instead, they know, embrace and manage around their weaknesses. fixing weaknesses is just another strategy to play safe playing not to lose instead of playing to win. change your focus from fixing weaknesses to capitalizing on your strengths because you will grow the most in your areas of talents. > focus on emphasizing your strengths instead of fixing your weakness. 9. stop waiting to start > stop waiting for the things to happen, go out and make them happen. if you dont purposefully carve time out every day to progress and improve without question, your time will get lost in the vacuum of our increasingly crowded lives. before you know it, youll be old and withered wondering where all that time went. there is no degree of live your dreams.. life is short. dont wait for tomorrow for something you could do today. your future self-will either thank you or shamefully defend you. 10. ignoring your vision for future no matter where you are right now, you can have any future you want. but one thing is for certain, what you plant you must harvest. so, please plant with intention. mental creation always precedes physical creation. the blueprint you design in your head becomes the life you build. dont let society tell you how your house should look. you are an artist and a creator. your life can be exactly how you want it, whether or not its considered a mansion by others. home is where your heart is. hold the vision, trust the process. > a man without a vision is a man without a future.

where do i start?	i'll try and be succinct. i'm a software engineer, own a home and various other assets. however, i also have a fairly high cost of living at the moment and can really only float for a few months without my current income. however, i have wanted to start my own business for a while now . i keep coming up with ideas and finally had one that i think could be quite successful, but i'm a software guy, not a business guy. my main concerns are how to actually start? my current plan would require me to stop my current job and start working 10 hour days minimum to meet the requirements for the business to be successful. should i just go for it? beyond that, how do i get my business started, such as getting public interest/initial customers? i basically need a minimum of 11 customers to get going, and my subscription based product isn't exactly cheap . i have ideas for expansion as well but that's obviously a way off. additionally, i could probably afford to do this without a business loan, though my business would require a vehicle asset, which i'm not sure if i should have in my name or under the business and if it should be a loan or a lease. if i do end up needing an office and or employees or additional expenses i will probably need a business loan. is it better to bite the bullet and get a loan now or wait until i've tapped out my personal funds, and should the vehicle be in my name or the business and a loan or a lease? finally, any thoughts you have will be appreciated. any activities or exercises i should do before proceeding?

starting two new businesses, need tax advice?	we're in michigan and my hubby and we just bought a new house. my hubby is going to be working two jobs, one at a regular store up the road and one with my dad who started his own business. i'm going to be working a normal job in the morning, tutoring and babysitting in the afternoon, and in a few months i'll startup my own nail business at home. my question is, what tax credits/exemptions do we qualify for and how do we find out otherwise? my family used to go to h and r block when i was young but we stopped when they found out they were scamming my parents or just really bad at their job. either way, i'm wary of going there for our tax questions and i don't know if there's anywhere else like that. we have used turbotax previously for our previous jobs but i heard that you have to pay for the home/owned business one and we had trouble with it so we weren't sure if we should go with them. basically we're wondering what we qualify for and how to fully find out. what do you guys do? what do you recommend? also, tips on how to successfully start my business would be great too. i don't have any competition really for a few miles surprisingly. all the real estate was taken up by grocery stores and fast food places so the closest salon or nail shop is the next town over both ways. so i know i'd have some customers. i just don't know where to start or find resources. edit sentences missing.

how can the creation of new businesses online be improved?	too frequently i find myself browsing forums, sites, and business threads and while there are always valid and important conversations happening across all platforms, i rarely find opportunities or appropriate avenues to build on to my own or other creators' ventures. take a small health-oriented smoothie venture. an individual may have the recipe, branding, food management, and local health compliance knowledge, but they are lacking the funds to execute any of the necessary tasks or acquire required resources. seems simple enough, just find a financial partner on site x, y, or z and you're good to go... but i think we all know it's not nearly this simple and no seasoned investor is going to take the risk in investing what seems like a sound idea on face value. more than likely they're going to be looking for a formal business plan, analytics regarding the market the venture is in, cost management plans, store-front / experience model rendering, and so much more. the current expectation is that if these creators want to actualize their idea, they are going to have to pay out of pocket for all these project assets and that's where most ideas stop due to effort or lack of capital/skill in creating the required assets. initiation ------------------------------------ i'm thinking there has to be a better way to do this and provide better avenues that allow creators to gather the assets they need to raise capital and the first thing that comes to mind is community contribution, but nobody works for free, so what's their incentive, and how do you comfort this creator in sharing their plan with strangers across the internet? i think integrated ndas should provide some piece of mind for the creator and a documented amount or percentage of funds raised or equity if successfully funded would provide incentive to help create and develop required project assets for acquiring funding. funding/capital ------------------------------------ now the much larger problem, acquiring the capital. with a community approach, how do you provide incentive? equity or a usable service product reward, but unfortunately i don't think a week of smoothie vouchers for shop in rhode island is going to get any support in oklahoma. so we have equity, but legally this is where things get much more complicated, and personally is not an area i'm very familiar with. not to mention the the cost of error is very high. a solution that comes to mind is utilizing smart contracts in combination with an llc to handle the disbursement of funds to the members of the llc , but my knowledge of llcs leads me to believe the mass amount of members and potential for conflicting opinions could lead to chaos in terms updating the articles of organization and moving forward on operational initiatives. all of this is what has led me to my initial question how do you think the creation of new businesses online be improved? side note i am not trying to create a smoothie place haha, i do like drinking smoothies yes, but i just used that as an example. 	intuzu	/r/business/comments/85c5hr/how_can_the_creation_of_new_businesses_online_be/	11	0	0	0.5	1521389410.0

what playing clash of clans taught me about business	i will totally admit that i use to play clash of clans and it actually taught me a very valuable lesson about business that i feel is worth sharing here. if you are not familiar with the game well, it is a strategy based game that requires you to build a village and attack other villages. the main source of money exist in two forms, gold coins and elixir, which is used to upgrade your village. if you want to win in the game, you have to upgrade and this is how the developers make their money, charging you for more gold coins and elixir to upgrade your village faster in order to compete and beat other villages. so what does this have to do with business, very simple, if you want to win you need to upgrade. building a business and getting that business to continue to grow is a strategy that is going to require upgrades. when starting a business some of us might have a limited budget and cant get all the nicest and best things we might want to run the business, but this does not mean we cant get the job done. as your business grows, and starts competing with larger businesses, you are going to be forced to upgrade if you want to keep growing. to keep the profits coming you are going to have continuously keep reinvesting into your business and upgrading just like in clash of clans. in the game if you dont upgrade, you lose, it is that simple, because there is going to be a bigger better village that comes along and kicks your ass with ease, because they chose to keep upgrading. the key in the game, and in your business, is to know what upgrades to get when, and how to properly use them. the point is technology is evolving and advancing at a rapid pace. this advance,ent in technology is changing the way we do business and how we make money. imagine a store that decided they did not want to except credit cards as a method of payment, they would lose an enormous amount of business because they didnt want to invest in an upgrade. right now there are companys that might be facing this challenge, asking themselves should i spend money on this, or should i spend money on that. you have to know what to invest in and when, it is a strategy. i will completely admit that currently i probably invest half, if not more, of what i make back into my business, but because i do so my business continues to grow, and that growth makes me happy, just like winning in a game makes the player of that game happy. i am winning, and if you want to win, you might want to start treating your business like clash of clans.

looking to buy a small town florist shop - unsure where to start	hello all! i was taken on part-time at a florist shop in my town and the woman who owns it is ready to let it go. she's agreed to mentor me for several months while i decide if i want to purchase it. the purchase price is with or without the building the shop is run in. eta the purchase price without the building is 50% less than the purchase price with the building. this will be a first for me, purchasing an already established business and it's inventory and customer base. i'm looking to avoid mistakes and pitfalls and do my due diligence. what are some things i need to be aware of? i'll be doing my research in the coming months as this shop is very behind in trends and technology. i have a deep background in marketing and communications. i have some experience with bookkeeping and profit and loss. i have zero experience in the floral market. thank you in advance! i'll be around for awhile if there's anymore clarity needed.	quasidance	/r/business/comments/8670i1/looking_to_buy_a_small_town_florist_shop_unsure/	4	3	0	0.8	1521675401.0

advice!!! help with co-founders % structure	so i am having a bit of a problem to figure out how to make a deal with my partners for a business we are preparing to run. i would like your opinion on the matter. the thing is like this, we are 3 partners me, my friend and his brother. since last year we have been talking about starting our own business. i would be handling the operations and they would be handling the sales and promotion part, bringing the people. so we never really discuss about the structure of the business just who will do what. we just kept things equally distributed but after a couple of months later i find myself reluctant to keep on with this term, even though we have had some potential customer i have done my part of the job but i don't really do it enthusiastically and many times stall. so i started thinking why i was not excited and i realized that i wasn't happy with the terms, we can't divide everything equally. although we are 3 partners the business will be divided in 2, operations and sales, which my friend and his brother will be doing the latter part. so early this year i proposed a 50-50% structure which my friend declined of course, saying that we all will be working hard for the company and should be compensated equally. i really consider them as partner because they will compensate for my weaknesses, networking and can do attitude. they are very outgoing with anyone and can get them talking about business really quick after just meeting so they always have new ideas and think about thousands of possibilities for selling any product/service, so they have the networking skills i don't possess. their can do attitude is also helpful for my lazy or too analytical behavior. i am always like sounds good but he have to research it in depth and i end up not doing nothing and procrastinating until the perfect moment appears. to illustrate what they would do, at the beginning we started having meetings to talk about the project and coming up with the company's name, we also talked about the website so as soon as we came up with the company's name that same week my friend contacted a guy he knew that does websites, got the domain and we started putting some info on it. i probably wouldn't have done anything until we really started running the business. but, although they bring new ideas they also bring some really crazy ones, or just too extreme for me, if i wasn't there opposing they would have probably done it with their impulsive can do attitude. like when they wanted to register the company with just a random guy or his girlfriend id . the random guy idea came from a person they just met that told them he registered his company using his chauffeur id. this was like during the first 3 months of planning and that really put me off on the idea to start a company with them or if we do i need to have at least 50% control so they don't come up with any impulsive ideas and be like 2 against me. since telling them the 50-50% structure, which they declined, i have been thinking on just starting on my own, like just creating the operation service of the firm and then working along side with them. this way, i can accept the equal distribution for any client they bring, but i would also work on creating my own client base. but the problem i see is that the service might overlap. it might be possible to frame my service a bit different, but still it's same service on the same industry. it sounds greedy from me to take part of their clients but the ones i get are only mine, there's a highly conflict of interest here. i am probably jumping too far ahead because until this moment we haven't created the company yet . who knows if we would succeed or not. i don't want to be seem greedy but want to protect my self-interest , i want to be fair for all the parties involved. sometimes i tell to myself that we should just start with the 33% each, just so we can start making deals and start operating, but when i see the long term this might hurt my earnings a lot, doing 50% 60% even 70-80% of the job and just earning 33%. i also recognize that working together with other people is the best way to improve and get out of your comfort zone especially when they fill up for my weaknesses, like their networking skills. so i struggle with fomo , fear of missing out, on opportunities that i know will be impossible to get on my own. i afraid i am being too egotistical and short sighted, this could lead to a great opportunity for all of us. but by feeling how i feel i do prefer not doing anything and avoid future problems with my friend and damage our relationship because of this small business venture. thanks for taking the time to read my long post, i would love to hear back from those who has advice or opinion on the matter. if you have any personal experience anecdote please share with the rest of us.

i work with a food delivery company. what are some ways we could increase our orders through our partners?	currently, im a driver and do some promotion for the company, and my manager sees me as a pretty smart dude, so he asked me to come up with a list of some ways to increase orders/business through our partners . were basically in competition with companies like grubhub and uber eats. for example, one thing i noticed is we gave our partnered restaurants promo cards for customers to get $7 off their delivery orders, but ive noticed a lot of the stores keep the promo cards, basically hidden behind the cash register, so the customer doesnt even have a chance to see our companys discount promo offer, which could be a loss for potential customers. i was going to suggest we get actual card holders and place them in a reasonable, visible sight for customers. any other ideas?

how to find a manufacturer for cheap small plastics	hi all! i'm a entrepreneur looking to make a startup, and i was wondering if i could get some guidance. i obviously don't want to give away what my business idea is because it is still in the works, but i want to get some sort of deal going with a manufacturer to create multiple small plastic items in a decent size quantity. i don't know where to begin to look for this sort of thing, the item doesn't have to be high quality plastic, but i'm worried that anyone dealing with that sort of thing will want a lot more volume than i can handle, as i'm only looking to produce small runs of the product until it gets going. please let me know of any ideas/resources/knowledge you could and would share with me, thanks in advance!	hobojo1234	/r/business/comments/8avxnf/how_to_find_a_manufacturer_for_cheap_small/	5	1	0	1.0	1523249361.0

social chatting in the workplace how much is too much?	i run a small manufacturing business with 6 full time employees. 4 of them work in the open assembly area grinding away all day putting our products together. i've always let the workers be as social as they want as long as they are getting things done. but i have 1 employee who seems to be taking it a bit too far. all i hear is her chatting away all day. talking my other workers ears off. i have my office door closed and i can still here her all day long even when i have my headphones on. the things she talks about do not have to do with work, it's all personal stories she repeatedly tells to anyone who sits near her. every other employee here has complained about her excessive chattiness at some point over the past few months. we all just kind of deal with it, because how can you tell someone to not talk? 1st amendment rights and all.. but realistically i believe it's becoming a distraction to my other workers. if she's talking their ear off the whole time, and they're too nice to say something, that means they're distracted from focusing on what they're supposed to be doing and getting the work done slower. i don't know what the best way to curb this would be. i can't tell her not to talk, but something has to be done. any ideas?	0ilTycoon	/r/business/comments/8b2drh/social_chatting_in_the_workplace_how_much_is_too/	5	6	0	0.8	1523310964.0

how do i grow my company but avoid making my product less desirable or losing its flair?	i'm in a position where i own 3 in my view successful one item specific bakeries. two are in a very year round foody, hipster, touristy area a few miles from each other and the 3rd is about 7 miles from the other 2 in the middle of a town very accessible for other towns and traveling tourists if that makes any sense. anyway i gross about 5 million a year and net about 1.5 million. this growth was over a very short period of about 4 years due to the niche of what i offer and the area i am located in. i am very diligent with my budgeting and have really tried to keep each dollar accounted for. i have recently purchased a van to provide delivery services of my products to local businesses which is consistent but a very small portion of my revenue. with this being said i am trying to expand which i think the delivery service will start to grow but how else can i grow without becoming oh it's just those guys again no big deal. right now i feel my product is very desirable and the name definitely has strong recognition within the area. i am also thinking about purchasing or leasing a production facility since everything is made in the 3 stores. should i rent or buy? about my market. -i am in an area where residential growth is booming. -the income demographics are above average in the specific region of the state. -the product i offer is made by a number of competitors but mine is healthier and made with locally sourced products and commands a much higher price per item. thanks for your input and please ask for any additional details.

how do i find an investor who wants to do over a billion us dollars with my ideea?	hello everybody, first of all, english its not my first language and i will do my best to be understood. i dont want to waste your time because i know its precious, if its not your domain of activity or future one, i will say before the main word of this business ideea crypto . i want to change my life somehow doing big things since i was 15 years old, i start working since i was 11 years old and for me its enough, i hate depend by a boss who give me small amount of money, in the early 20s i decide to be professional poker player and this is what i am today. i know its hard to be millionaire from this job and i know i can to better and earn more money from other domains, some people will say many words about poker, but i started as a last shot to have something to eat and to do something legal because with 200-400 euros salary you cant pay doctors for your grandmothers 8 years to do chimiotherapy, different surgery for example. i have few ideeas of business but this one its one of the greatest, i have some knowledge about it because before starting playing poker at 22 years old i have worked with people from this proposal business ideea and i know the psychology of the customers and they will be your customers, crypto will go hand in hand with your activity. what this business brings you on the table and how you will grow it, from where you will get money and how you will you have an impact in the modern economy -commission from crypto tranzactions made by users -big amount of money from the crypto owners who wants to raise their price level of their coin and be part of this business. . they will search you for staying at the table with you. -you will do crypto coins beeing more used than their are in this moment -its in everybody interests also here i have more interesting lines about how you win but i dont say anymore because beeing m/billionaire its not like you dont have brain to figure out what its all about, but you will win big from it. some people will say im crazy, maybe i am, but this is my price, 100 millions euro, 60 before, 40 after. i offer you discrestion, exclusivity and the chance to be the first doing this because more will follow you, i am a man of honor and for me money its a bit like paper but i dont want to spend my rest of my life in rush for them because i need money for eating, growing my kids, offer them a future, traveling with my wife and most important thing, i want money for health, mine and beloved ones, for example when i write this words, my grandmother who grown me my entire life until 25-26 years doesnt have more than 2 weeks to live, all the doctors said that, my wife's mother have also a malignant tumor and my mother worked her entire life to put food on our table and doesnt feel so well with blood pressure, sugar in blood and so on. my dad died at 33 years old when i was kid and my grandfather 13 years ago not having money to give him a chance. i want my family close to me because they spent over 20 years working in another countries. late edit after discussions from private we need to create a platform like kucoin or cryptopia where people can add to their wallets different types or coins accepted by us totaly safe and legit. simple to accept them all like a normal exchange. an exchange its useful and can be a bonus to this platform,this is not the main job of this platform, we have other goals. we can take commissions from withdraws, small ones and we can give them other opportunities /skyline/shight/view. another late edit i did some research and the closest website/platform one who can have a good infracstructure good for ours its kucoin and cryptopia, i believe are more but not so safe and legit that those are. we create an enviroment where people put their coins, exchange them if neccessary to use our service. the money comes from exchange, withdraws, my ideea and from cryptocoin owners who wants to grown their price and made them more reliable/useful. also we can give exclusivity to some specific coins to be used in our service and this can helps to bring more money from people who wants that exclusivity.

why did my local ramen restaurant just do this? jam-packed every moment they're open, but decided to cut prices.	i'm just really floored as to why my local ramen restaraunt did this. their business is so good they're only open during the 2 hour lunch rush period and the 2 hour dinner rush period. during those 4 hours a day, 6 days a week, they are completely full. there's always a line that extends to outside the building if you don't get there within the first 15 minutes. the last time i was there, the moment they flip their closed signed to open, 4 parties, one of them being me, were speed-walk racing each other through the front door. when i went in there yesterday, they had cut new menus and cut all their prices by 10% across the board. for the old price, you can now get a side order of fried rice or some other side with your meal as well. my question is why would they do this? i feel like from from a layman's perspective, they're just strictly making less money. am i wrong?

how do i go about buying a small business?	im new to the world of business and id really appreciate any advice you can give me about buying a small business. i am interested in purchasing a baby sensory franchise in the uk. this is a business that offers classes to parents with babies from 0-13 months old. at the moment the classes are mobile and run in rented rooms. someone in my local area is looking to sell their business, theyve been running classes for about a year and have a small client base. what do i need to know before i buy? id need to purchase her kit and she has said that she would be looking for 75% of the initial cost for it. there would be things i could buy in addition to the kit but most of that would be optional and lessons could be run without extras. i would also need to purchase the territory and franchise from the company. id be using up a fair chunk of my savings and i really dont want to be making a bad investment as im a single mum and thats a lot of financial pressure. im really drawn to the business personally so im worried that it might cloud my judgement. could it possibly be more worthwhile starting from scratch and developing my own class brand? thanks in advance for any help 	no_new_ideas_here	/r/business/comments/8idhlr/how_do_i_go_about_buying_a_small_business/	9	1	0	0.66	1525943119.0

need help business presentation- no business experience	i apologize for the length. my boss told me that i will be giving a presentation at the end of may and i don't know where to start. background i run a retail store. we've had a physical location since the 80s and an ecommerce site since the 90s. i've been with the company for over 5 years. i was recruited as a puller/packer for the site and worked up to running the operations of both the website and sales floor. my job has always been boots -on -the -ground operational management. sales floor direction, staff management, customer service, online order fulfillment, etc. at the end of 2017, our founder/owner decided to retire and closed the physical store - selling the website. i was recruited by the new owner. the new parent company is a digital marketing agency with years of experience in ecommerce, but from behind a computer. marketing strategies, site analytics, seo optimization, etc. i made my experience and skills very clear from the beginning. i was never involved in the finances, ar/pr, budgeting - nothing to do with the backend of the business. we outsourced our online ad campaigns and never strongly utilized analytics. we were successful as a small business and weren't trying to build an empire. i was repeatedly assured that existing employees within the parent company would handle those duties. we have people to do that. here we are 4 months later, and those people have never materialized. as a one -man operation i've worked to create brand new systems by googling and/or redditing everything, copying other people, and making up what i don't know. we're making money, but i can feel the constant pressure because we're not yet turning a profit. then, my boss casually tells me that i will be giving a presentation. tl;dr the presentation our very brief conversation included the following information the audience will consist of every important person within the company -managers, investors, etc. the presentation will outline my plan to grow the business by 400&37; between june 2018 and june 2019. i was told to 'think big' multiple times. the issue i have no plan.. i have no idea how to even start a plan. i have no business acumen, experience, or exposure. i've never seen a business plan or witnessed a presentation similar to this. i have a b.s. but took no business classes in college. any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.

investors want in but plan seems sketchy to us. is there a benefit or do we take it there on our own.	so, my wife and i started a woodworking business not long after our wedding last year, so we are almost a year in we were looking to get a new logo and on of the designers also happens to invest in small local companies. he met with my wife at our home shop to see if he could get a better idea of how to create the logo we wanted and while here, he realized we were more than just a couple who does stuff on the side, and it interested him enough to want to invest. we had a sit down yesterday and talk over his proposal and them recieved it in email form last night. i work full time for a different company and then work on our business off hours from my regular job and my wife does our business during the day. it boils down to this investor wanting 40% of our company and is offering his buisness experience, contacts, other companies that he owns/partners with. but, the proposal seems to keep us doing everything still and having to split profits as 25% for each owner and 50% left in the account towards the business. i guess the hang up is the 40% to the investor. and the way the profit is split. i would be more than happy to supply the proposal if you care to read it and give feed back. thank you for your time.	somethingdifferent99	/r/business/comments/8j3iaf/investors_want_in_but_plan_seems_sketchy_to_us_is/	22	9	0	0.66	1526215234.0

marketing pros wanted advice on how to increase traffic to our kickstarter	hi there, its hard being self employed and promoting your own project. i'm part of a two man band and we set up a product design studio. in 2016 we successfully launched a crowdfunding project on kickstarter for an all metal pen. we've now launched another project for our second, updated pen design and added a mechanical pencil to match. previously we didn't really do any marketing other than facebook and instagram posts with the hope of people sharing and liking, just relying on luck. but this time round we've made an effort to do targeted marketing and we have driven a lot more traffic to our project and we've far surpassed our previous funding which is amazing for us! however, we've reached the dreaded plateau. we had some great momentum from the promotion we have already done but we've run out of steam. if anyone has any advice on who or where to promote our product, it would be greatly appreciated. here's a link to our instagram for some context as my father says, marketing is like black magic and i'm no magician. some of you out there must be old hands at this so please teach me your ways! thanks!!

how to solve an issue with hsbc 	this seemed like an appropriate place to share, since hsbc is touted as a good option for international business banking. we had moved our current accounts over to them, and had also opened credit cards there. but we did not have any access to the online cc statements. here's how we solved that... day 1 speak to person at branch front desk , who sets you up with a branch representative. speak to representative at the branch you need to talk to branch services manager. she'll contact you within 24 hours. day 2 no contact within 24 hours, so go into branch and find branch services manager you need to talk to your relationship manager day 3 email relationship manager you need to talk to my customer support manager customer support manager is out sick. have to email with her backup. email to backup customer support manager i'm not familiar with that account. you should call the customer service support center call to the customer service support center we don't have the empowerment to fix that issue. you need an account coordinator, but there isn't one assigned to you. i'll ask them to assign one and call you within 24 hours. day 4 don't hear anything after 30 hours, so call back. speak to a rep after 10 minutes on hold, she connects me to her supervisor . after another 25 minutes on hold someone will call you back within four days. day 9 after five days with no response, call a different line and speak to a program administrator specialist . i don't know why no one contacted you. i'll escalate this with you, and follow up to make sure they call you. day 11 after two days with no response or follow-up, called back and spoke to another program administrator specialist . you're not authorized to receive a call back, so no one was going to call you. i've re-escalated this; your account coordinator will call you back within a week, depending on how busy they are. day 14 get an from an anonymous email account with some forms to fill in. over the next five days, go back and forth with our anonymous contact about the users. day 17 we receive log-in details for our new accounts! day 18 the account details don't work. ask the anonymous person to call me . he resets the passwords, and i can get into the website. success! it's not working correctly though. can i ask what browser you are using? chrome. ah, i see. the site is primarily designed to work in internet explorer. 	missstar	/r/business/comments/8m4lzl/how_to_solve_an_issue_with_hsbc_aka_getting/	2	7	0	0.83	1527277927.0

how to better write your company's mission statement	establishing a company mission statement is important in order to make sure that everyone within the company has a common goal to look up to and achieve. but how do you really write a mission statement that actually showcases your company's what and who? and should it overflow with business buzzwords and jargons just to make it look and sound awesome? an article i have come across recently talks about how fortune 500 companies write their mission statements and the emerging trend at close scrutiny and how you can write your own that will deeply communicate to people who belong in your niche. here is a summary of that insightful article ask yourself the right question starting with what you are doing or what you will be doing using your business. this will help you clearly communicate what you want to do for people or the society. this particular approach is what harley davidson do when it said in its mission statement this very words we fulfill dreams through the experience of motorcycling, by providing to motorcyclists and to the general public an expanding line of motorcycles and branded products and services in selected market segments. summarize your internal goals and how you will or are achieving it and share it with your customers or those people who love your brand. stating your goal and how you go about reaching it also tells consumers how committed you are not just to the business but to the services you offer, as well. never forget to state who you serve and who will benefit more when it comes to your service.

my outsourced developer just quit, what to do?	hi, as a developer myself i have been running my start-up for little over 6 months. some while ago i decided we needed more developers in order to grow and contacted a company in my country that outsourced developers. i basically agreed to hire 1 developer full-time for two months to help me finish my project. a few days before the developer was to start, they called me and asked me if i would agree to have 2 developers work part-time, since they wanted to train their developers to work more in a team. i agreed, since the project could be subdiveded into smaller tasks pretty easily and figured an extra set of eyes couldnt hurt. fast forward and we are 3 weeks from hitting the project deadline. as far as i can see we are pretty much on schedule. one of the outsourced developers contacts me and tells me that he has to quit and that i probably heard it already from his manager . now they want to let the other developer work fulltime to make up for it, but i'm afraid this is going to cost us quite some time, since the guy who quit had quite a few tasks in progress. he has also done work like checking api documentations and such. i'm afraid we will lose valuable time trying to understand and complete his code. i have a meeting planned on tuesday with the company who outsourced the developers. they feel like it won't matter a lot if we let the other developer work fulltime. what would be my best move?	bobray	/r/business/comments/8q0i4p/my_outsourced_developer_just_quit_what_to_do/	8	8	0	0.71	1528634009.0
how do i determine the value of my boss's business?	little background, my boss is the proprietor of three pizza franchise locations in town. i've been working for him for 9 years, worked my way up from delivery driver to gm of one the stores. recently i found out that he might be looking to sell and retire soon, so i'm thinking about trying to buy the location i manage from him. so how can i figure out what a reasonable offer would be? he doesn't own the building, just rents a lot in a shopping center at about $1200 a month. starting the store cost him about 500k, sales after taxes come out to right around 550k a year. best i can figure out he's coming out with something like a 15% profit margin all said and done. edit the town i live/work in is steadily growing so i think the store has potential to bring in more sales in the future, but so far it's been very consistent year to year, no immediate evidence that it's growing in value.		/r/business/comments/8q694v/how_do_i_determine_the_value_of_my_bosss_business/	11	5	0	0.67	1528686643.0
company bought out...they want to keep me but dont know what position to put me in?	our company has operated very well and was bought out by another major company. me and a colleague met with the ceo privately on site over the weekend for a tour and description of how we operate. he was very impressed and gave us nothing but praise afterwards and later on in an email. my colleague, the ceo felt, should be groomed for the gm position. it was difficult for me to hear this as much credit for my work was given to him. my colleague did try to give me kudos but the ceos mind had been made up. ive taken care of all the other side of things. my colleague has taken care of overseeing most of the trade work and ive overseen he rest of the administration and business. meaning from remedial work up to negotiating contracts. finance/hr/benefits/ purchasing/etc etc they made a comment that they want to keep me as i had been revered as a good leader, had a lot of institutional knowledge, and was extremely capable. they asked my colleague privately if he felt if he felt like i was an asset and needed to keep me- to which he openly replied later of course. i have a bachelors degree in healthcare administration and majored in business. when they found or i wasnt a cpa and didnt have an accounting degree but was handling the finances he had an attitude like ha thats not good. ouch! besides my pride being hurt, this company can outsource all of my job functions -which is a relief because i am massively overworked. but now im petrified because what is my job? they dont need two gms and they made it clear. i am not sure what to do next. i am utterly lost on where to start and what to do. i obviously have to protect myself and set myself up for success but how?

any experience with photo-studio-caf for families, friends and tourists? 	i have this business idea which consist on have a caf-photo studio/gallery. basically, a place where people/tourists can go for a coffee or tee and cakes as well as being able to use a small photo studio to take photos of their family members and friends with their own cameras using the studio lights and outfits. on top of that, the walls would have photographs exhibition for sale . i know most photo studio are only profitable only because they sell prints, frames, cameras and others products and services. i am not interested on selling and photo service or product but only rent the studio for a small fee for people to play with. but have a small caf shop to help attract people and make it profitable with the help of the exhibition and sale or artistic/touristic photographs and postcards. it would be great to hear a feed back from someone with similar experience. my second search is about a city in europe where have a considered number of tourists and where locals are outgoing enough to feel attracted on visit my shop to have a good time. but , where land are not too expensive so i can purchase the property and start a business.		/r/business/comments/8rpwjg/any_experience_with_photostudiocafé_for_families/	5	7	0	0.66	1529226376.0
how to ask a willing but flaky friend to contribute to a project	there is a project i'm working on. previously, i've worked on different project not related to this one. i usually work on my projects independently, and if i need help, i'll pay someone for that certain amount of work. i have a friend, who wanted to be part of my previous projects. he has good professional skills, so i'm not worried about this friend's skillset. but he is raising a family, and has a full time job. what i'm worried is, he might get burned out juggling full time job, raising a family, and working on this project with me, and so later just let go. so my question is, what kind of business models are there to make things clear when he does decide to part ways? i can't say 70/30 partnership, and a few months from now, he quits but still has a 30&37; stake in the project. i can't say log your hours, because in the event you quit, i'll pay for the hours you have contributed. or am i being too minutia about this whole thing? any ideas or links will be highly appreciated. thanks in advance.	randomguy112233	/r/business/comments/8rqoem/how_to_ask_a_willing_but_flaky_friend_to/	7	1	0	0.6	1529238057.0

my boss left me in charge for a week, the new girl wont listen to me. how do i change this?	ive always been the girl whose been to nice and clueless to people who are mean to me. example if someone was being mean to me in school and then they said just kidding id laugh it off and be like oh no problem we can still be friends. so this has became a problem in my current situation now. ive been working at this small shop with 2 other girls. theyre both 17 and know nothing about being responsible. how it works is we work alone. nobody works together so ill take my shift and then the other girl comes in and i clock off. i have the morning shift and the other girls get the evening. recently we hired a new girl and i let her slide on some stuff because she was new and kept reminding her to do things. its been a month since shes worked there now and she still isnt doing anything. the day shift tells the night shift what needs to be done and theyre supposed to do it. so i tell her what needs to be done and she doesnt do a drop of anything. she wont listen to me, she rolls her eyes at me when i talk to her. when i get to the store the next day, all of what i told her isnt done. that leaves me with the stuff that she didnt clean up or do on top of what i have to do that day. which puts me in a panic mode when i have customers to deal with and my own stuff. im literally doing all of the work their while she is just on her phone. ive tried telling her nicely that she needs to do stuff, she says an excuse and then says ok and never does it. now my problem is since ive started telling her she needs to step up her game with doing stuff, if i do one thing wrong she texts me saying that i need to start cleaning up after myself and making sure the place is clean. ive been working there for 6 months now and shes only worked there for one plus shes 17. i know she doesnt care about the store, shes just telling me this to be sassy because shes mad that she got in trouble with my boss. my boss is going away on a trip for a week and left me in charge of the store, this girl is now telling me what to do when i know that place upside down because ive worked at the store every day for 6 months. she knows absolutely nothing and does nothing. how do i take charge? every time i get angry and upset im like ok you can do this, time to step up and show whose in charge but once i see her i clam down into a shell and end up being nice. i can see this becoming a huge problem this week and i dont want to lose my job because i cant take control of a 17 year old brat. please if you have any advice on how to be in charge and stop letting people who are mean overpower me, i really need it.		/r/business/comments/8rtarn/my_boss_left_me_in_charge_for_a_week_the_new_girl/	7	7	0	0.82	1529263026.0

don't exactly know where to go with marketing?	 i'm a bit lost. i need to push my marketing forward, but i don't exactly know where to go... it's like, there are so many directions i need to go, so many things i will need to do going forward to market my things.... so many things to learn, but i'm paralyzed because of it, not that i don't want to learn these things... just don't exactly know where to start when it comes to marketing, or how exactly i should be spending or investing my time. i have two successful videos, and while they still do get traffic, i don't exactly know how to capitalize on them, because trying to move forward with other videos or repeating the same process, i don't get as much traffic... this was a tailored version of a video i made for youtube, it was done in a buzzfeed style, and it was made to compare footage from an anime, side by side, with a censored american version, which i think had hilarious results. i think this would tap into pop culture consciousness, as that was one of the numerous approaches i experimented with, especially since it was mean't to follow up on another successful video i've done. this facebook video i created was extremely successful in terms of the amount of views it got, it didn't do much for page views, comments, shares, or what not... but it's a great start... i'm wondering how future facebook content i create could yield more user engagement such as getting them interested in my brand or visiting my website or being more curious about my product? i think this is the best route to go, since i see fantastic potential in the results i got... but i have been a little stuck the past few days trying to figure out where exactly i should go next	eutrophic	/r/business/comments/8sdnff/dont_exactly_know_where_to_go_with_marketing/	2	1	0	0.66	1529451851.0
i went self employed and fell on my face. how do i interview for a job after voluntarily leaving my last one?	i quit my last job, a job as an ops manager with 100+ employees, in an attempt to be self-employed as a freelance writer. long story short, i failed and i ended up not wanting to pursue it as a career. i am underemployed as a frontline employee as a call center, a job i took to help ease the bills while trying to pursue the dream. i need a job i'm qualified for, and i'm ready to be back on the market. i left my old company on good terms, and they would be willing to take me back, but half the reason i pursued a self-employment opportunity was because of the impossible work/life balance company culture demanded since we went public. i did 70 hour weeks, needlessly, for nearly a year and a half once we floated. i left gracefully, with a one-month notice and i even hired and trained my replacement. long story short, i'm dreading the interview process. i feel like i'm coming across as i want to self employed, but trust me, i will work for you. or i'm someone who quits once it gets too demanding. and i can't shake that. does anyone have any advice for coming back into the market at their previous level after voluntarily quitting?		/r/business/comments/8sssvy/i_went_self_employed_and_fell_on_my_face_how_do_i/	11	3	0	0.81	1529595015.0

how to scale quickley	i have recently taken over my fathers business. it's pretty run down, has some massive r&m overheads, and the lack of systems in place drives up unnecessary expenses. however, it has a fairly good reputation, has good relationships with the raw materials suppliers in a fairly competitive market and significantly more demand that we have supply. i would estimate the market could take another 50&37; in sales volume from our core product, and we could leverage our brand and grow into other areas if we could retain good quality and push good marketing. i am limited by our site, equipment and lack talented staff who can help me with growth as ever since i have come on board it's clear that i'm really on my own and have far too much to do to get it all done myself. it would be difficult to hire currently as the business could not justify hiring in these positions, but will stagnate growth without them. more importantly, industrial land is expensive to purchase, and we would need a fairly sizable site to store materials and the cost would be about the equivalent to one years worth of revenue. i am already going to have a sizable loan from buying. i would need to invest heavily into the site, so im reluctant to lease even long term as it will affect the businesses value, and will leave it vulnerable to rent increases. i want scale quickley, but am worried about capital, and making such a big leap that the company has never had in it's 30 years of operating. any good ideas?	thylacaleo	/r/business/comments/8t875i/how_to_scale_quickley/	5	2	0	0.67	1529736497.0

what is the most correct/fair way of agreement about sharing future benefit from a project?	i am a complete newbie in doing business. i have an idea of an internet project which will likely become profitable in couple of months once it is online. i asked a colleague developer to start that project together and he agreed. the idea of the project is mine, i have a complete project plan, with features descriptions and part of the design ideas. i will be leading the project as agreed. he is the only developer and he will be writing all the codes, at least for the first part until we see that we really need to hire others. the project doesn't need much investments for now, so we invest equally. question considering all the above, what is the most fair way of sharing presumable future income? is there any common way of handling this kind of situations? what is the proper way of evaluating efforts of each of us? i would appreciate an advise on how to handle this correctly. addition i know that the most logical way would be if i just hire a developer and don't think about sharing the profit with someone. but at this period i really can't afford hiring a decent developer. and he is a really good professional who i am sure will do the technical part right.

student organization advice	a little background. i am part of my university's fsae team. fsae is an international student competion ran by sae international , where students deisgn and manufacture small formula style vehicles for a fictional contracter and judged in multiple categories. obviously, engineering and manufacturing a small car is expensive, and the responsibility of funding falls on the students. the vast majority of money for most teams comes in the form of sponsorships. where it is in the form of materials, time on test equipment, lending machines, or cash, a lot of funding comes from companies. other sources of income come from the university's budget, personal donations, and fund raisers. budgets for teams vary greatly. there are teams like mine who have a modest budget, and there are teams who have budgets close to or over a million each season. this can depend on a variety of factors. generally, the more you win at competion the more money sponsors give to have their company logo on your car. more prestigious or stem focused universities give more to their teams. my team has been improving rapidly over the last 3-4 years, placing in the top 40 with teams who have a lot more money than us. but there is the issue that is repeated to me over and over, money. our team is currently full of really good engineers, but the business side of the team has been lacking. i want to try to keep the momentum of the team going, and i want to do so by improving marketing and looking for new sources of income. there are ideas floating about right now, specifically trying to recruit business and econ majors, and setting up an online store to sell merchandise. i was curious if there are any fundementals or ideas that i can use going forward into this next season. just because we have an online store doesn't mean people will buy stuff from us. what would make people want to? how do other student orgs or non-profits increase income? are there any good rules to stick to when trying new marketing strategies? are there any absoluely do nots? are there any cheap or free services to help us? any advice will help as this is a new avenue for me and the team, thanks!	honkyhorsepower	/r/business/comments/8w1yzc/student_organization_advice/	2	11	0	0.79	1530713975.0

 owners of businesses that need too much data what tools do you use?	hey. i'm sorry if this isn't the place for such a post, but i feel lost. i am working with a real-estate business and we're supposed to collect data based on cities, areas, whether it's for sale or rental, type of real estate, and so on. it's a huge list of categories, and they need to be properly organized. i tried sheets, docs, everything possible, but the amount of categories is making this turn into a puzzle. there must be software specifically for that task, such as a data entry software or something that helps with project management? i've looked around on google but to no avail. any help, please?

how silicon valley stops innovation	silicon valley promotes their amazing ability to build innovative products and services that change the world. the reality is that this is for the most part a lie. the most innovative companies have actually done very simple things that for the most part arent very special. this isnt usually fault of the founders, rather, the ignorant investment community whose real purpose is to hold back amazing people. uber shouldve released self-driving cars in 2012. google fiber shouldve been in the usa everywhere by 2010 and global by 2011. apples products are absolutely trash considering the amount of bugs they have, yet they have all the money in the world for development. this isnt the fault of travis kalanick or every team member at fiber. its more the lack of imagination and creativity that many wealthy individuals have regarding the future. ive found that in silicon valley, you will develop an up and coming world-changing technology , and jealous investors will take control of the company and screw it over . there is so much fraud with products and the announcements made in general. snapchat is a joke that i will not even bother discussing. god forbid an actual self-made teen comes along and tries to make a name for himself. almost instantly i was ousted by frauds such as vinod khosla whose life depends on his false billionaire title. tesla cars are made in china, their mileage is about 1/3 of what is advertised , and youre not saving the world by driving the car. ive lived in china and theres nothing wrong with having cars made in china, but you cant make it such a selling point . ive found the general rule of thumb to be that silicon valley will do nothing but hold you back from actually releasing your world-changing technology. the ignorant vc community will talk about how expensive it will be to develop a new technology. theyre either lying, or theyre just ignorant . beyond that, there is the basic level fraud from organizations such as startup grind, which is largely filled with aspiring sanitation engineers. basically you will run into a circle of crap events with toolbag founders that have nothing but crap advice. ive spoken at one of their events, am i a tool now? 	advncdfinesse	/r/business/comments/8xlozj/how_silicon_valley_stops_innovation/	2	1	0	0.54	1531198469.0
how my ex-cofounder stole almost 1m usd from cazza	it was april 2017. everything was going quite well for cazza. wed just finished the dubai future accelerators program and we had the attention of the entire construction industry. just the month before, we had closed our first 100k usd of funding at a 25m usd valuation. we were looking for office space in finland, right outside of helsinki, all with much excitement. it was fernando de los rios who was the coo, and i, chris kelsey, the ceo. when we first registered cazza as a company, i had 51% and i let fernando have 49% of the company because i figured sharing billions of dollars wouldnt matter to me. id originally met him at a startup event in december 2015, in san francisco. at the time i was running my app development company called appsitude. he reached out to me in january 2016 about meeting for coffee, and i figured why not and met with him. he told me about the different startup ideas he had and that he had been working at whole foods to cover rent and living expenses. i could tell he seemed quite motivated to succeed, so i hired him as a project manager for some of our app projects. overall he did well, but by around may 2016 i was realizing that i was paying him more than he deserved for the work he did. i noticed there was an unhealthy amount of greed in the back of his mind, but he didnt show it often so i chose to ignore it. in july we began traveling the world, starting in china which led me traveling to many other countries. in august 2016 i moved to beijing. he went on a three week trip with his friends in the usa working very little while i was working typically 1216 hours a day. i felt more and more that i was carrying him, but just when i would call him out, he would improve just enough just so i wouldnt cut him off. eventually it came time to register cazza , and he asked for 50/50, i told him i can do 51/49, and he agreed. in october 2016 we had our first press release which made cazza begin receiving a lot of attention globally. we were then invited to meet with the dubai government for potential collaboration . my goal was to share the big vision of where cazza would go with the world so that we could get the funding to build the machines. i was willing to do it at any cost because i knew the amount of positive change it would have for the world was worth whatever it took. people said i could get assassinated because im disrupting an industry with construction mafias, i didnt care. fernando would travel with me usually and i noticed that at almost every meeting, i would either 100% of the talking or 95%. i did about 98% of the work at cazza and he would really be there more for feedback regarding my ideas. but, as i said, it didnt bother me that much because i figured that half of billions of dollars isnt a big deal to share. in april, it got to the point where i realized he really was doing almost nothing for the company so i began making him have to talk at meetings. this made him very upset and further increased his envy of me. i would always come up with great ideas, say the ballsy things on the news, and take risks. he would just hide in the corner and go along with whatever i did. now, when the cazza bank account was made in the usa, he registered it for me because i was out of the country. the funny part is that he put himself as the main account holder and i was a guest. i didnt know this until later on when he locked me out of the bank account. april came, fernando said that his one friend wanted to invest 100k, it went through. at the end of april i told him i wanted to take a break for 2 weeks in the mountains of india. i was trying to figure out what i wanted to do with my life as a whole because i knew i wouldnt have to worry about money ever again in the near future. i also told him i wouldnt be responsive while im in mountains because the reception is bad. i fasted for 14 days, i did not eat food or drink water . once i had finished, we spoke again only to find out we received another 700k in funding, but when i looked in the cazza bank account, there was $10,000 usd. i asked him what happened, and he told me he was worried i was going to steal the money in india so he wired it out to a different bank account. now i knew this was obviously very sketchy but i also knew there wasnt much i could do at the time. i figured the best thing to do would be to continue getting the r&d center ready in finland and see if he just disappears with the money. over the next few months, everything was fine overall. the machines were getting finished, the ui for the machines were looking amazing, and i was quite happy with the progress. i moved to la and started making music for fun around this time, he moved to nyc. he also put back more and more money into the cazza account which made me gain more trust, although he never put the full amount back in. we did not need the entire 950k to complete the machines. the original plan was that we use the first 150k to build the machines and get to a series a and raise 20m usd. the rest was for us to use on what we wanted . he gave me an amex platinum and a black card to spend money directly from his other account . in october he randomly removed me as well as cut me off the cazza bank account itself. he then send i spent 300k in a month, that cazza overhead was 100k a month, and that i screwed over the company . he told me i needed to sign papers saying he would have 51% ownership as an equity exchange for spending the amount of money i spent. i signed because we had employees on payroll and i wanted to make sure he didnt stop paying them. they still got paid for another few weeks until november came and one of our employees messaged me asking when hes getting paid. he said he hadnt been paid in 2 weeks, and i spoke with our chief engineer and he said that fernando wasnt buying any of the materials anymore and everything was stagnating. i called him asking what is going on and he said that i had spent so much of the company money that we cant pay them. i then called our chief engineer and found out our monthly overhead was 20k/month, not 100k. fernando lied about that, then i also looked back at my expenses and realized id spent about 150k from may to november, not 300k in a month. he then started telling different people that knew me that i spent the company funding and that cazza stopped because of me. its interesting because he not only stole the money but did it in a really stupid way. he just stopped paying employees without notice, and left everyone hanging. you may ask why i didnt stop this i couldnt because i had no control over the bank account after he put it in a different bank account. i dont have intentions of suing him as i dont believe it will be very effective, i also believe the world has better plans for him than just a silly lawsuit. update for those saying im stupid for giving away the majority of the equity, the company was already screwed and it gave him more legal liability for the debts he now owes . he also brought in 850k from his friends that my company wouldnt have otherwise had at all, so you can say im stupid for having him tag along, but some of that 850k did actually get used for the business/myself and i did greatly benefit from it. you can say im stupid but im pretty sure you werent a self-made millionaire by 19 .	advncdfinesse	/r/business/comments/8xrodj/how_my_excofounder_stole_almost_1m_usd_from_cazza/	16	0	0	0.4	1531245479.0

what are some ways i can check to see if a business i might work for is legitimate.	i recently applied to a job on craigslist. the job offered me a good salary and bonus. the job description is package handler. the responsibilities include facilitate receiving and storing, moving and shipping of supplies, stock and materials, effectively managing the timely flow of order processing. i am just confused on the business in itself. it seem almost too good to be true for the pay. so i would technically be a middle man for delivering their packages from home? this is a stay at home job except for delivering the packages i think to dhl for them to deliver to customers . i got an email with a contract with pay. and 30 day probation period, payment can be through my bank wire transfer or paypal. they have a professional website but its really hard to find on google and i also cant find any reviews of past employees on google. what can i do to find out how legitimate this business is and that i am not signing up for something thats too good to be true? has anyone been involved in a parcel forwarding business from home ? is this business normal and safe to be involved with. to my knowledge the packages will be all types of things. they have stores such as disney and other big brand names that they work with.	chewba1247	/r/business/comments/8zlkch/what_are_some_ways_i_can_check_to_see_if_a/	7	2	0	0.67	1531837534.0
what is the best business skill to self-teach?	i am an business administration and accounting student about to get his degree. while i am proud of my education, i feel like my knowledge is mostly academical in the sense that it isn't really part of me. many times i've studied from notes, or not as deeply as i wanted, just so that i could meet my deadlines. now, i am looking to choose one subject and start studying it on my own free time. i want to take my time to analyze every concept without the time restraint imposted by an incoming exam. the problem is, i don't know what to choose. i initially went with human resources management because that is the role i have in my no-profit student association, which is sort of a students-only company where we are supposed to first learn and then offer actual consulting services to local business. i've found a course on youtube and i'm currently following it, but i'm honestly not sure whether or not this is going to be useful in the job market. the subject sounds a bit fluffy , not really technical, and i fear i might be learning something that is really easy to come by for employers. so, i narrowed down my choices to four. 1. accounting. 2. corporate finance. 3. marketing. 4. human resource management. my plan is to buy the best regarded academical book in the chosen subject, and teach myself everything inside it. i would then start following major influencers in the field to keep myself updated. can you help me choose? or propose alternatives? thanks.		/r/business/comments/909o83/what_is_the_best_business_skill_to_selfteach/	7	13	0	0.78	1532033753.0

how runescape taught me to succeed in business	i started playing runescape in 2004. i was seven years old. a kid named cory was playing it and i asked him about the game because it looked cool. i decided i wanted to try it out. my first accounts name was chrispoopoo1. i ended up making six accounts starting from 1 all the way to chrispoopoo6. why did i make six accounts? i kept getting lost near lumbridge, so instead of trying to figure it out how to do anything, i decided i should just keep making new accounts. i didnt know about runehq or any guides at the time, and even if i did, my attention span was so short i would never have been able to read them. i ended up making an account called yourule40. i dont remember how i came up with this name, but it stuck. i have reports against my account from as early as 2006, for attempting to impersonate a jagex mod or saying really stupid things that nine year olds say online. i wasnt originally allowed to talk to other people online, so i did anyway. when i was eight, i felt really bad that i was doing it behind my parents back, so i told on myself. from then on i only attempted to communicate with other players via emotes . i remember when i made my first 10k, i gave it away to some random person in draynor. i meant to do it as a joke but i accidentally clicked accept twice. he started walking away and i just kept following him, using every emote i could that would suggest i made a mistake . i didnt get the 10k back. i played the game on and off for years and i finally made my first 100k in 2007 from mining pure essence . i got very excited as i always just assumed id always be broke. it was the first time i had really grinded to make some gp, and i felt rich. over the years i began learning more and more ways to make money in runescape. in 2011 i noticed that people were doing doubling scams. for those that dont know what this means, you would go to a popular area such as the grand exchange, and just say doubling gp or doubling 100k etc. the idea is that you trust them to give the 100k , you accept it, then they trade you again with double the money you gave. when i first saw it, i thought it was hilariously stupid. then i saw someone doing a doubling scam, and people around him started saying oh this guy is legit! i immediately knew they were lying to help the doubler look legit. i decided id try it out for myself because i had become tired of grinding to earn money. i went to the ge and put on my best gear, i started saying doubling 100k+ where i then had two friends come and pretend to trade me. they started saying i was legit. all of a sudden 23 people would come and trade me 100k or more. i ended up making two million gp in 30 minutes. i freaked out because id never made this much money so quickly. after sharing the profits with my friends, wed do the same thing over and over. some of the people i scammed would eventually become my friends . i eventually had enough gp where if someone gave 100k, i would legitimately double it for 34 people, where a lot of people would start saying i was legit. the most i ever got from one doubling scam was $5m. over time, the doubling scam began to work less and less and i eventually stopped doing it . this taught me about how establishing a sense of legitimacy works . it also helped me understand why the testimonials i saw on tv seemed so fake. i had a friend on rs who had full dragon armor. one day he messaged me and asked me to vote for his clan. he said to search for a youtube video. i found the video and it was a montage of a clan fighting, and my friend was offering me $1m to vote. i clicked the link in the description so that i could vote. i immediately grew suspicious as i realized that the website looked just like runescape, except the url was not the same. the friend then began threatening me saying that he had my ip and knew where i lived. i got scared because i was really confused as to what had just happened. i never entered my info on that website , because, as you already know, it was a phishing site. the friend of mine had been hacked and they were using his account to phish other friends. i never knew this person outside of rs which is why i hadnt noticed that he was hacked. this event inspired me to then follow this persons footsteps. theres many other finesses ive done that i will always be proud of, but not this one of them. i made a clan video by taking pictures of large groups of rs players from google images. i then found a free web host . i found a site that had the phishing files and i set up the website. my friends and i all began attempting to get people to vote for our clan. wed split the profits and overall focus on getting as many players from different worlds. i never actually made that much from it overall, maybe around 350m. regardless, i felt bad because i screwed over a lot of players who had likely spent a lot of time getting the money they earned. i realized that i could make more gp than i ever dreamed of. this also helped me realize that if i could do it in a multiplayer video game, i could become rich in real life. although keep in mind, there is a big difference between becoming rich and becoming successful. there are many rich people who are unsuccessful because they profit from deceit . i began caring less about runescape itself and only about the money. beyond the money, there was a massive thrill of seeing a correct password appear after a player tried to sign in . two of the friends in my group eventually lured me into a battle with a halloween mask and i instantly died. they set themselves up where they were on my team, but they were actually working with the team against me that killed me. before i went in the portal where i died, i told my two friends that if i die, theyd have to compensate me for the helmet. i already had a suspicion it was a setup, but i had more money in the bank so i didnt really caremoney that is easily earned is easily spent. they partially compensated me for the halloween mask, but my one friend was upset that i told my friend he needed to compensate me. i thought it was strange because i had specifically told them that if i lost it, theyd have to pay me back. 2012 came around and i stopped caring about money even more. i asked one of the people from my group to mine on my account because i didnt want to risk getting banned for botting. i had a high mining level so the idea was that hed share the profits with me. one day in the summer of 2012, he asked for my bank pin because of some reason i dont remember . i gave it to him as a test to see if hed steal the money from my account . he ended up stealing it, around 200m. i didnt care about the money at all because it came to me very easily, it just upset me that i was betrayed. the thing is, it wasnt a person that id known for a few weeks or months, id known him for about a year and a half. we had played many other games together besides runescape. i just felt somewhat sad that he decided to do that. it ruined what i thought was a good friendship. with that being said, there were definitely signs before the money was taken that led me to believe something fishy was going on. but as i said, i didnt care about the 200m, i wanted to test him to see if hed do it. i knew i could always make the money back. i ended up quitting soon after as the runescape community began falling apart more and more . six years later, ive since forgiven the person that stole my gp. it was a massive life lesson. i also recently made a new account on osrs and have been playing with the same username, yourule40. it helped me develop a mindset of doing whatever i can to be the good person in any situation. theres many times that ive lied in order to get to the next level, and i dont regret those lies because without them, i wouldnt have been able to be in the position to change the world like i am now. i considered them necessary sacrifices in order to help the world in a way that no one else would be able to see. not to mention, this really helped teach me to put myself in other peoples shoes before i do something that could hurt them. i now follow a path of complete honesty . when i say white lies, an example would be that i was getting laser hair removal done, and i had recently tanned the day before. the person doing the laser hair removal said i was very tan and that she wouldnt be able to do the laser hair removal . i knew that my body could handle it, so i told her i tanned three weeks ago on the beach, and they continued with finishing the laser hair removal. this is an example where i didnt want to lie, but i knew that my body would be able to handle the hair removal process and the person was just following protocol . despite being honest and a good person, it does not mean i will be nice to those that dont deserve it. i will never stop calling people out that need to be called out, even if it offends them. this is because there are a lot of people in this world who act like the way i did when i was 14, except they are playing with real money and lives instead of runescape gp. that is why i now approach everything from the understanding that we need to stop trying to throw others under the bus. it will only hurt you the most in the long run. for those that know about my cazza story and think that i just have trouble learning how to trust the right people, the reason i lost my money in that case was for a different reason. in the cazza situation, i had been fasting for 18 days, so i dont care about losing $800k. its just unfortunate that my ex-business partner was so filled with insecurity and jealousy that he did what he did. one of the biggest lessons ive learned in life is that id rather be the person attacked than the attacker. why? 1. i can handle the attacks better than 99.99% of the population. 2. the guilt from being the attacker is far worse than anything id ever want to go through. 3. i can recover from any attack someone wants to throw at me, whether verbal or physical. you might be wondering why most of what ive just said is more related to life lessons than business. the thing is, ive learned that the most important business lessons are actually life lessons. when you follow a path that is true to yourself, you will always reach a point of true successwhere you are honest not just to yourself, but everyone around you. now my goal is to help the entire world reach this mindset. no matter how much money you make, if you are lying to yourself and others, you will never feel successful. ive met millionaires and billionaires who have lower self-esteems than homeless people.	theycallmecpk	/r/business/comments/94f3ki/how_runescape_taught_me_to_succeed_in_business/	4	2	0	0.75	1533343883.0

currently feel like i'm under-pricing my work, how do i get out of this pitfall?	hi there guys, i'm starting my side gig of photography/videography services and i feel like i've been pricing quite low. today while at a car event, a guy approached me and asked for a quote for a quick shoot. i told him 20$ since i thought it would be a quick 30 minute session which is fine by me and he already had a 20$ bill ready to pay. after the shoot was done, a few minutes later his friends approached me and asked for pricing and i told them 30$ since it was getting darker and i was about to leave. they mentioned how i charged their friend 20$ and i told them its because conditions were perfect and he was ready to pay right away when i wasn't busy. we started the shoot but decided to hold off and do it another day and they wanted to bring all their friends out for the shoot too and i told them i'd charge them separately and they said that's fine and we'll pick a day soon. my main concern is that i under priced myself when i know my services are definitely at a higher level i know when they ask me, they'll ask for a rate or for the 30$ per person shoot. how do i go about avoiding this in the future? i accidentally did this earlier before but was able to rectify it so its fine but i feel like mouth speaks faster than my brain and i under-price myself heavily. i think its due to the fact that i really need money and i don't want to lose business. for the current situation, if they message me, i was going to tell them its a different rate since i have to get all my equipment, travel expenses, to plan the shoot and to edit all the photos afterward so pricing would change to 50$ each moving forward, i'll definitely be more bold and confident in my pricing and have a set day rate or hourly rate and if they refuse, i'll slowly negotiate but bring down the total work involved so its more fair . i would love some insight moving forward so i don't make this mistake anymore. thank you in advance! tldr i under-price my work. how do i avoid this in the future and if people ask me for the rates i charged for their friend how do i go about telling them they would receive the regular rate which would be quite higher?

why can't the us simply print out a lot of money without having to raise the prices of products and services?	printing lots of money is one of the main reasons that causes inflation. reason being is that, the more money that is printed ergo circulated, the less valuable it becomes. hence prices of products and services are raised as a result; defeating it's initial purpose of cranking up the country's economic gear . but what if the us government stepped in and simply not allow the prices of products and services to be raised thus keeping the status quo. with the only thing being different is that, now, there's more money for everyone to spend. and as ray dalio puts it one person's spending is another person's income. the more income a person has, the more that person's likely to spend . with that being said, wouldn't the printing of more money while regulating the prices of products and services would've been the solution to the 2008-2009 recession? is it really that complicated? because it seems easy to me. simply cough! use bitcoin instead of fiat cough! print more money and not raise the prices of goods and services to keep the newly printed money's value.	axle_gallardo	/r/business/comments/9gwukt/why_cant_the_us_simply_print_out_a_lot_of_money/	2	0	0	0.29	1537291452.0
what does your staff really think of you?	as you grow as a company and start to take on more and more staff, it is vital to set a culture that really encourages people to stay. this isnt through threats and scare tactics, but through a supportive and positive working environment. finding great staff is hard enough already, but its retaining them and giving them a sense of belonging that will transfer into their willingness to do their best to serve your clients. in simon sineks book start with why he explores the idea that your success always comes back down to your employees. if you look after your employees, if you inspire your team, there will be nothing for you to worry about. they will be the drivers of your success, and we couldnt agree more. so just how do you provide the best for your employees? you need to know what you can do for them, which means that the best way is to ask them. finding out what your employees really think about you and your company is scary, but the honest opinions from your own employees mouths is second to none. honesty is the best policy at outsourcing angel, we bit the bullet and did just that. we sent out an anonymous company survey to find out what our staff really think of us. we always hope and work towards building our company up with love and support, but we needed to know if it was really reflecting in our company culture. we created the survey form using an online tool called wufoo and asked questions such as what did you think of the company before you started? what did you think of it once you started? what feeling does the company give you? what makes you want to stay? what can we do to keep you forever? the vast majority were able to complete it in time, and luckily, we were able to let out a sigh of relief that almost 90% of our staff had raving reviews of our company. seeing such positive thoughts and to see that the loving culture that we set out to create is actually being taken on and fostered by our family of staff is heart-warming and incredibly motivating. but just as important as the good reviews were the minority of negative reviews. it was these reviews that really gave us the guide to grow and improve for our staff. thanks to the anonymity of the survey, some staff were able to tell us exactly what they were dissatisfied with. we were even fortunate enough that even these staff members retained enough faith give us constructive feedback that provided room to grow. they spoke about our shortcomings with new staff, and the anxiousness they felt about not having clients immediately. to be clear, its not about listening to the advice to know the feedback, its about taking on the advice and taking immediate action. within days of getting back the results, i addressed it with a fb live video to all our staff and clarified some issues and told them our solutions moving forward. i wanted to demonstrate that their voices are important and that we take their feedback seriously. what about you? if youre looking for ways to grow your business, its not always about looking far and wide for magic tools. taking the time to really understand your staff and to invest in them will take you much further than you could imagine. one important tip from us is that when you approach this feedback activity, make sure youre giving the opportunity to receive real, unrestrained thoughts. this means that you need to be willing to hear the good, the bad and the ugly without any prejudice, and that they need to feel comfortable telling you everything. we achieved this through anonymous online forms, so if you would like help setting that up, send us a message or speak with our team and we would be more than willing to help. if youre willing to take responsibility and take action to give your staff the best, the hard-work and loyalty that they will reward you with is simply immeasurable.	outsourcingangel	/r/business/comments/9gzjhx/what_does_your_staff_really_think_of_you/	2	1	0	0.57	1537310230.0

how to meet like-minded people?	hi all, i'm having a slight dilemma. i love my friends, i sincerely do, they are good people and there's plenty of reasons why i keep them in my life while also taking my time to contribute to them. however the challenges i'm facing with them is that i cannot talk about business with them, they are still under the consumer minded umbrella pretty heavily, and that's okay, i do not judge them for that. i just find it very difficult to find people who are obsessed with producing something who isn't full of total shit about it. by total shit i mean, someone who talks out of their ass and doesn't actually execute anything, somebody who is running an mlm and they own their own business , you know the kind. i don't want to associate myself with these people and i avoid them like the plague. i want to hang out with people who are involved, knows the ins and outs of business, people who are rock solid and thick skinned, people who execute and don't just stand around with their thumb up their ass. the issue is the medium. i know someone who has contact with someone who is very successful whom i've met before. i asked this someone to put me in contact with this successful person so i can have a moment of their time over a cup of coffee, 30 minutes, and this someone ghosted me as if i was a threat to him somehow. so now i'm back to square one in my meeting like minded people ventures. does anyone have any insights on where to find these people? knocking on doors in success ridden neighborhoods seems too intrusive.

dun and bradstreet gives away false information about my company to business websites who post the false information.	i first noticed when i googled my company name and my company had a profile on a website called manta that showed up high in the google search results. i looked at it and it had terribly wrong information. it said our revenue was only 52k per year and that we had 2 employees. my company has been in business for over 14 years. we havent ever done as low as 52k in revenue. the previous year we had done over 500k and had 12 employees. there was 2 other websites on the search that showed later and offered the same info. now, its not that i'm worried about showing how much my revenue actually is to people, but if a potential customer had a large project and they googled my company to research us, and thought we only had 2 employees and only did 52k, they would think we wouldnt be able to do their project. that's why the false information is harmful. when i called manta to tell them it was the wrong info. they said they get all the info from dun and bradstreet. they did take my company off of their site though. so then i called dun and bradstreet. they told me after a bunch of mental gymnastic bs that i had to become a paying member to correct the mistakes that they sold!!! isn't that illegal for them to give false information that can interfere with my business? doing a little research online, it seems like this is a common thing for them to do. anyone have the same experience?

how to run a successful business and have ptsd	if anyone has any tips out there i'd be grateful. since my son's suicide attempts in 2016 the drive i had to run my business and my development company has suffered a major hit. i've still been working but have made no attempts whatsoever to build my business and after one of the builders i was working for went bankrupt it's left me in some financial trouble. skillwise i am great at what i do and have a good reputation for that, however not a lot of people know of me on top of the fact that i've become pretty reclusive and a terrible salesperson so approaching new clientele is more than uncomfortable for me. however i don't want to make excuses for my failings and even pushed rather hard against my ptsd diagnosis with my psychologist because i don't like playing the victim. so while there is this major 'what's the point' attitude within me, on the other hand i want to provide for my family so i do want to make my business work. i don't want to go on welfare for the ptsd however i know that i'm just a different person now. back when i was very sociable i would have no problem approaching new builders and selling my skills with confidence. if anyone can help with this issue i'd much appreciate it. thank you.	urbanphil0s0phy	/r/business/comments/9oj10j/how_to_run_a_successful_business_and_have_ptsd/	3	2	0	1.0	1539653565.0

how to insure a drone business?	hi guys, i'm currently looking to start up a drone hire business, this would include having an inventory of drones that can be hired out to both recreational and professional clients. my only feasibility issue at the moment involves how i recover the expense of the drone if it's damaged by the customer. i don't want to have to get them to sign a 'you break it you buy it' policy because it will just be too difficult to enforce and my biggest client struggles with signing things like these off. the obvious solution is to get the drones insured but every company i approach says that they'll only insure the owner for the owners use. this problem shouldn't be any different to any company that hires out anything?! if anyone can offer any insight or solutions i'd be massively appreciative. thanks in advance!	vennegoor1993	/r/business/comments/9qct3d/how_to_insure_a_drone_business/	3	8	0	0.85	1540206584.0
when to talk budget for a project that obtains funding after initial effort	i'm self employed, and was recently approached by a company to do some work for a campaign of theirs. i set up an initial call, and we went over a timeline, which would be 1. initial ideas for campaign nailed down 2. apply to internal company funding for budget 3. i provide consultant services on the project as it progresses. the issue is, stage 1 involves a significant amount of my time. probably around 35-40 hours. i'm unsure how to approach negotiating a definite payment for that time, given that they won't have a budget, or specific contract together for what my involvement will be, until after that initial effort. i'm happy to put in some effort up front to ensure the project gets off the ground, but i feel like this flow of things has gotten me turned around. i'm used to negotiating, signing a contract, then getting on with everything. nothing has been signed yet, so obviously i'm keen to get some sort of agreement on paper, but since i have no experience with what the norms are, i'm unsure how to bring up my desire to sign a contract to ensure payment for my time without stepping on toes, especially since we're past that initial call, and my verbal agreement to get involved, now. i realise this is a ridiculously noob question - i apologise profusely.

when to liquidate and call it quits?	companies that go into bankruptcy can be forced to liquidate and shut down. there are other situations where companies are slowly declining - but they never seem to call it quits until they're forced, which may actually be years after it's apparent. this happened to sears recently. the writing was on the wall, but still they persisted, telling themselves they had a turn-around plan, but i'm not sure anyone ever believed it, because there had been a fundamental shift in their business that made the old dna pretty useless. i have two questions - intending to be about large enterprises is it better to just liquidate the company and return the maximum value to shareholders pre-emptively, or is it better to slowly slide into decline, eventually be worth nothing, but extract revenue on the long decline? are there any examples we know of, of companies that pre-emptively called it quits, liquidated, and returned capital to shareholders rather than grinding themselves down to a nub and being forced?	everywhere_anyhow	/r/business/comments/9s6h11/when_to_liquidate_and_call_it_quits/	5	3	0	0.62	1540758742.0

is it possible to start a business with little to no money and if so, how to go about it?	im going to show you how to start a business without money and you better believe it. sure, to start a business without money is much harder than if you have sufficient funds in place but hey, if you can eventually have a business of your dreams without putting up a ton of money of your own upfront, why not, right? this blog post came about as a result of a question how to start a business without money which im often being asked by aspiring entrepreneurs via how to start a business and succeed . the very first time someone asked me this question, i though, seriously?! thats what you want to know? clearly you need some money to start a businessi mean, you cant just set up a business like that without moneywho does that?! but then i thought about it long and hard and eventually realized that yes, you can start a business without money and its not all that difficult. before we get to it however, lets park money aside and quickly look at whats essential for any one business to come into being in the first place and exist or thrive thereafter. while money is certainly very important and necessary, its not the only thing needed to start a business. in fact, money is of no use if you dont have the winning idea, target audience with otherwise unmet needs, wants and desires which you can fulfill better than anyone else and of course the know-how or the adequate skill set. peter f. drucker aka the management guru or the father of modern business stated that a business is an organ of society and that the purpose of business is outside itself. these two statements are so very profound and if youre able to truly understand them, your perception of business will change forever. the purpose of business must never be and can never be to make money, thats a mere responsibility of any business. every responsible business must make profit to stay in business, pay for itself and its growth. the purpose of business therefore has got to be outside itself or in other words, to fulfill otherwise unmet needs of its target audience, who traditionally happen to reside in the same society as the business serving them. today however, thats not necessarily relevant any more due to technological and communication advancementsnonetheless, the principle of detecting otherwise, unmet needs, wants and desires and fulfilling them, remains the same. so, in essence, for a business to come into being it has got to have clearly defined why, who, what, how, where and when. lets briefly look at each one 	benjo_skulj	/r/business/comments/9spnqo/is_it_possible_to_start_a_business_with_little_to/	6	2	0	0.6	1540917797.0

looking to go into business with a friend who already has an established business, how do i come up with a proposal? what are best practices?	my best friend started a business back a few months ago, it's a small store and website. competition for the store is weak, almost non-existent; for the website it's pretty average, but the website is really just a side dish to the store. i work a few shifts at the store a week as a secondary source of income and really enjoy it; i have enough money to start my own store, but i'd rather just start a second one under my friends brand. he said he is interested and asked me to bring a proposal to him. the idea here is that it would be like when you want to purchase a mcdonald's; you don't own mcdonald's but you own that one store and take a large percentage of the profits and give some back to the mcdonalds . i prefer an arrangement like this for a few reasons the store requires license's to sell certain products and operate it, i am under the impression that i could run the store under his. get access to all his suppliers and connections, significantly cutting down on the amount of leg work that would need to be done. store is well known and has customers over a large geographic extent. i don't think i need to explain the benefits of this, they're obvious if you have ever been to a chain before. don't have to compete with my friend. what are my first steps? could you point me in the right direction? also please correct any of the assumptions i make in this post if they're wrong! thanks!		/r/business/comments/9vqsck/looking_to_go_into_business_with_a_friend_who/	6	2	0	1.0	1541817389.0

about to start an llc to invest in my company with some friends...need help!	my company just had its final round of funding, and we reached our goal quite easily. the time has come to turn pledges into cash.the business is poised to do very well, and we are turning down outside investment. the founders of the company are opening up 40% of the shares to friends and family of the company. company operators are given first option to buy. on top of my sweat equity, i'm investing cash as well. im bringing some friends on board, with each friend investing a. different amount. my business partner and i will own the most equity , and around 10 of our friends will own the remaining 30%. in total, the llc will own about 3% of the company. my main question is, if my business partner and i want to form another company under the umbrella of the llc, but separate from the other investors, how would we go about doing that? do we form another llc, or some different kind of company? i'm a total noob when it comes to this stuff, and while our ceo is a financial whiz, he's got so much on his plate right now i'd like to try to do this on my own before asking him to help me out. i know i've only given a brief description of my situation, but i'm happy to elaborate for anyone interested in offering some advice. what other general pitfalls should i be aware of before starting this llc as a way to invest a few hundred k of my friends and my money? as the primary shareholder and founder of the llc, what would my legal responsibilities be, if any?

i have a solid idea for a brick and mortar business id like to open within a few years. where do i go from here?	my husband and i both work full time and we have debt to pay down and savings to build up. we have a high income in a low col area, so that shouldnt take long . until we have the money to put toward starting the business, what, if there are any, are steps i can take to get things rolling so that when the time is right, we just need a location and equipment? i dont even know where to start - just that i have this idea and i need to pursue it. a couple points this would be a type of bakery and my dad owned two local bakeries in the past so i have access to proprietary recipes that evoke strong memories for locals. i also have a former coworker who told me he would be interested in investing. his support is one of the biggest reasons why i think my idea would succeed.	kcl086	/r/business/comments/a1nzng/i_have_a_solid_idea_for_a_brick_and_mortar/	2	1	0	0.67	1543543310.0

help me decide what to do.	in our company, we have 2 brand/marketing supervisors, me and my friend. she's been with the company longer than i have, and she basically guided me around the company when i was new. recently our ceo is retiring and he announced that he'll pass his position to her daughter, our marketing/brand manager. i was surprised that i was the only supervisor from the marketing invited during that meeting. then the former ceo announced that all the people in present in the meeting will be the new core of the company. at this point, i am assuming that i got promoted as the marketing manager but there was no clear announcement. then the former ceo proceed and asked me how would i deal with my friend, he clarified, how would i manage her? he explained is interested to know my thoughts because he saw flaws in her . i was stunned and could not answer for a while. several thoughts are running through my mind. first, i was not aware that this is about to happen, my mind isn't prepared for this scenario. second, have they told her about this? third, am i legitimately promoted? fourth, i really don't know what to do with her because this is all sudden to me. so i came up with the safest remarks i can say about her, and our former ceo noded and just said okay. he again asked me another question how do i plan to restructure the department . again, i was caught and prepared and answered one manager, and three specialists . but stupid me forgot where to place my friend in the structure. everyone in the room stared at me differently, then i realized that i have done a bad thing to my friend. before the meeting ended, former ceo said that no one must know about the meeting and everything that happened in it. after the meeting, i searched for answers to some of the questions. i have verified that my friend does not know this and that they are gonna put me in charge of the marketing department. however, what am i suppose to do? i think everyone in the meeting thinks i'm heartless for cutting my friend off of the department . what do i say to my friend? what am i suppose to do? should i embrace the manager role now? they haven't told us that they will announce this big company shifts to everyone. should i just wait?	cjcopada	/r/business/comments/a2xots/help_me_decide_what_to_do/	4	0	0	0.25	1543901592.0

in which state should i form my llc?	so to start out, my business is e-commerce, and i have no physical office. i have heard from so many sources that the benefits of creating an llc in your home state far outweigh the benefits of creating in one of the hyped-up states like wyoming, nevada, or delaware. however my question falls along the lines of, where is my home state? i go to the university of alabama and will be here for 2 or 3 more years, but i have a house back in tennessee which is my permanent address. i will be working in my rented apartment at school for the rest of this year, but will be getting a new place for 6 months after that and then i will be in germany for 6 months after that. then i will come back to school in alabama for a year or two and then i graduate. overall, my address in alabama will be constantly shifting, for the next three years, and then will be non-existent because i do not plan to stay in alabama. my address in tennessee is a bit more stable, but i will not be working from there most of the time for the next three years. should i form in tennessee or alabama? any help is appreciated!

i think that the company i work for is doing something illegal, and i need advice	if this isn't the right place for it, then please direct me as to which sub to get help from. this question has to do with payroll and clocking in/out. i'm salaried, so this doesn't apply to me, but i have been informed that if an hourly worker clocks in at 7 minutes past the hour, their time gets rounded down to 30 minutes. if they clock out at 7 minutes before the hour, their time gets rounded down to the previous 30 minutes. so for example, if they are supposed to come in at 8 00 am, and they clock in at 8 07, the time gets rounded down to 8 30 am. and when clocking out, if they clock out at 4 53, it gets rounded back to 4 30 pm. this seems highly illegal to me, and i would like to know who to contact in order to report this. again, if this isn't the right sub, please direct me. i'm in the usa, so would i want to talk to someone in the dept. of labor?

thinking of buying a business. what are my financing options?	i recently came upon an interesting opportunity to buy a local company. the company has a 66% net profit percentage and the asking price is 2 years of revenue. based on this if i feel i should be able to pay this off in 5 years while also taking enough home to live. sellers are retiring. for many reasons, i think i could grow this and increase revenue and profit. the seller isnt interested in seller financing. what are my options? i have great credit, but not sure if where to look to first . any help would be appreciated update wanted to pass along a status update for anyone who may one day be in a similar position. 1. sba loans - after inquiry i was told that currently sba loans are reserved for new businesses rather than purchasing of existing businesses 2. bank loans - went to a bank and met with their business loan representative. they do often provide loans for the situation described. as you can imagine it is a many-month process and requires significant documentation. for anyone whos a homeowner, that is a piece of cake compared to this. some examples of documentation are - income statements from seller - tax returns from seller - financial documents from all accounts from a buyer - business plan from buyer - resume from buyer also you will still require a signifcant down payment i was told the terms of the loan are negotiable which is good to know. for instance first payment due, interest rate, down payment , length of loan, are all negotiable with the bank. one of the pluss of the meeting with the bank is hey provided a industry report. this is packed with super useful information anyone looking at entering a market i highly recommend getting your hands on one. 3. seller financed - many people recommend this option as its the easiest transition of ownership. knowing several people who sell businesses, this can be daunting as you put your business in someone elses hands before you receive your full payment. many sellers arent interested in this for that reason in short we didnt find many great for financing the purchase of an existing business. for now we have a new business strategy which doesnt include the purchase of their business which we believe to be the best route for us.	nick1787	/r/business/comments/a3vj22/thinking_of_buying_a_business_what_are_my/	7	3	0	1.0	1544150991.0

whose ipo's are investors more interested in? uber or lyft?	well, i think thats going to be a very difficult decision for investors. with all the bad light uber has drawn itself last year and the way it worked out in favor of lyft,, all really really putting all the investors into big dilemma! uber's valuation will be as much as $120 billion if it goes public in 2019, its more that current valuation of general motors,ford,and fiat chrysler combined, or eight times lyfts current valuation . however, it has seen a decline in its growth rate for last quarter of 2017 and 2 quarters of 2018. on the other hand, lyft's steadily increasing growth rate looks very promising. it may lead to investors interest shifting to lyft's ipos from uber's ipos. uber vs lyft. who do you think is going to win this going ipo battle? what do you all think about this entire scenario ?

i'm trying to validate my business idea and i need 50-100 business owners to answer short online survey. what would be the best way to do it?	hello, i'm having a business idea, and i'm doing a small research to make sure there's a market for the product. it's a website designed to help entrepreneurs and small businesses to connect and help resolve business related issues . i'm trying to make sure the pain points are not just a creation of my imagination, but they actually do exist and are quite common among entrepreneurs. to do so, i need to interview some decent number of present or future business owners . therefore i prepared that simple, fully anonymous , less than 3 minutes long survey in google forms. it contains mostly checkboxes to tick, nothing complicated. so now i'm trying to find an online community where i could engage required number of entrepreneurs. here's the link i would lie claiming i'm not hoping to get some fill ups from this reddit community, but i'd also appreciate pointing me in the right direction. i assume there are online places where businesses meet that i am not aware of, and i'd love to learn about them. i have tried facebook groups, linkedin groups, some business forums, even cold emailing, but no spectacular results. i was thinking to hit the coworking spaces, but that would give me feedback mostly from freelancers, and i'd love to get broader perspective. i'd appreciate tips on any standard or non-standard approach, as long as it works. thank you	JamesBond404	/r/business/comments/a59br9/im_trying_to_validate_my_business_idea_and_i_need/	8	0	0	0.25	1544552000.0

people are technologically illiterate, and that's why they are mad at facebook, and fooled by news headlines.	to clarify, i'm talking about the recent hate bandwagon. i'm not saying that you don't have your own valid reason for hating facebook. the recent bandwagon is based in ignorance though. here's two examples people being angry that facebook allowed netflix, and spotify the ability to read, and delete messages. this is a super common practice. spotify isn't going in, and looking at your nudes. apps need read/write access for messenger integration. if you go on spotify and click share on a song and click facebook messenger, it will open a window of your contacts, inside spotify and who to send it to, then it goes right back to normal spotify. this feature is only possible if spotify has crud access. create, read, update, delete. getting mad about this would be like getting mad that your email manager wants to read, write and delete your emails. netflix wasn't looking at your nudes either, this was the thing where you could click join account on your netflix or something and it would take you to a facebook page which said company xyz would like to access your account to do the following things..... allow / deny ? it just meant you could do things like for example click like on a netflix video and it would autopost on your facebook that you're enjoying the new tv show.. that was the purpose behind it. it needs the ability to read your account and write to your account for that, and the user agreed to that. they didn't go to facebook and say hey facebook give us write access to all your user's accounts! . think of being able to have alexa read your email aloud or to read your email on apples mail app, it's the same thing. when you agreed to this, it was clearly listed under this app need to access your phones location & read and write messages we've all seen that warning 10-100 times . . its pretty blatant...for all those who are upset by this how many of you are accessing reddit right now through a 3rd party app? apparently people dont want to be held responsible for their own decisions. people want relevant google results when they search for restaurants but get angry that google tracks their location. android apps do this all the time when installing them, in that it allows you to see what an app can do on your phone. it's standard practice. you literally tell these apps yes you can use this info when they ask for permissions, and now everyone feels so violated? dont install the applications and grant them permission then! people being angry about facebook selling data facebook doesn't sell data. that's actually a common misconception. they direct ads to you based on the data that they have. they never sell that data to advertisers, and advertisers never see the data. the implication often made by people that say fb sells data is that facebook tells whoever has money anything about you, in truth facebook never tells anyone anything about you. facebook takes things people want to show to a certain demographic, and if you're in that demographic you see it, but they don't give info about you to advertisers. they don't take data, you agree to let them use data. you give them data in exchange for free facebook. they don't show advertisers any data, they do use data to make money. there's nothing wrong with that, most sites on the internet make money through ads, and ads are target based on data the sites have on you. if a banana seller asks you to go show a banana to someone that likes bananas, and you never tell them who that person was that you showed the banana to, then you never gave that person any information about the person. you just found someone that likes bananas, and connected them with the banana. in short facebook doesn't sell data, facebook sells access to your attention. i plagiarized from u/lanebrn711, u/dramaminequeen, u/houseflip, u/liquidpig, u/saquino88, u/3000dollarsuitcomeon, u/fireproofspider, u/dr_gonzo_13, u/halr9000 because i was too lazy to write some parts. please don't take news headlines to heart without follow up research. companies like the new york times list facebook as a direct competitor.		/r/business/comments/a87gyh/people_are_technologically_illiterate_and_thats/	1	1	0	0.57	1545375980.0

i created an app that pays users when they play their favorite sports. in need of a technical co-founder	the app lets users earn money every time they play their favorite sports. such as basketball, football, & soccer. i'm in need of a technical co founder that can come in and get this thing out there. i've been on sights such as producthunt and cofounderlab but people seem to be more bark then bite. would love to know about any resources i might be overlooking or even some guidance about how to move forward. at the moment coast 2 coast is nearly finished on the android platform. we have a following and people waiting on the app. there is a concrete plan to monetize the app and a concrete release schedule once the app is finished. i am not one of those idiots who expect someone to work for equity or act appalled when my idea isn't the next facebook i have no doubt in a software developers profession they encounter those kind of people often. no proof of concept, no market validation, no wireframes, no traction just an idea that's worth gold . so far i haven't begun development on the ios side that's why i wanted to know what it would take to get it done. either finishing up the java side then converting both to react native so we can complete cross platform integration. or starting fresh. there are definitely some bugs on the java side as i'm just a beginner. the cofounder should be well versed in swift, java, and preferably react native. any and all feedback is required. i didn't go deep into how the app works and whatnot because sometimes it comes off as an ad and that's not what this is. however if i need to explain the app or even go into a bit more detail please don't hesitate to point that out. &; thank you	sariimarrero	/r/business/comments/aapz00/i_created_an_app_that_pays_users_when_they_play/	3	0	0	0.5	1546123983.0

my thoughts on why netflixs interactive bandersnatch is one of the most important milestones this year for a tech ceo.	hi, i made this article on my blog and adapted if for reddit no intent to self-promote as i don't sell anything but let me know in the comments what you think as that's the purpose. surely youve heard about this big company called netflix. a subscription-based streaming service that garnered over 130 million subscriptions. not only that, shit got really serious when they declared they will spend $8 billion on producing original content after spending $5b in 2016 and $6b in 2017. in other words, they said fu hollywood, were making it ourselves. and themselves they did it. this month marks their first interactive film . sounds a lot like an experience? it surely truly is. to briefly explain for a tech ceo what that means the film goes on but every now and then, the viewer must use their remote in order to make choices. visual example . just like a game, you could have a game over experience pretty fast but still go back in time a bit so you can see what a different path means. they did spend some time on it, heres the whole map of possible paths. because its a step forward to creating even more inclusive experiences, one you should be thinking about if you plan to win. because if from now on you dont think about how to include a more catchy package in what youre offering, you wont need to worry about user churn as there will be a bigger problem you will be facing. once again original content is king. and most importantly, this articles conclusion in one sentence experiences are the reason why the relationship between the company and the user gets tightened and why word of mouth is, consequently, generated. let me know in the comments what you think and hny ch daniel	chddaniel	/r/business/comments/ab9u2t/my_thoughts_on_why_netflixs_interactive/	4	3	0	0.72	1546281367.0

i sell bespoke software since 2017 for startups and i made a list of hidden traps to look out for when outsourcing your mvp.	hi /r/business! i am the cto of a dev team, we sell bespoke software for startups and i made a list of costly and hidden mistakes people usually make when buying bespoke software. it's a 5-minute read and it's specially useful if you're a non technical entrepreneur intending to outsource a startup's mvp. full article can be found here . instead of being forced to implement everything in-house and to reinvent the wheel, they create your project faster by using already written components. lets say your project involves online paments, your developers could either implement their own solution in a few weeks and maybe face some legal issues, or implement a solution using paypal/stripe apis in a few hours. its a no-brainer! how can apis ever be a bad thing? usually, theyre not, but there are some corner cases that can cost a lot if neglected. apis can be free or paid, based on their usage. even when paid, their price is low enough to justify using them instead of implementing your own solution. api providers dont give you access to their source code, they expose some black box functionalities to be used over the internet. this means that your project relies on their long term lifespan when an api goes out of business, any component that depends on it must be rewritten. an example is facebook severely limiting or shutting down parts of their apis for instagram read more on techcrunch, making any product that relied on them suddenly useless. this kind of event happens rare enough with large companies to still justify using their apis, but allow any obscure apis into your project and theres a high chance it will suddenly stop working a few months after its finished and you paid for it. some companies will sometimes try to sell you some of their apis with your project. they will deliver faster and a more qualitative product when using their tools than by being forced to use similar solutions of their competitors, so using their apis must be a no-brainer, right? if you are satisfied with them and intend to keep working the company, yes. otherwise, youll just force yourself to depend on them even after moving to another team, unless you rewrite some parts of your project, which costs money and time. a good practice is to always make sure your project is accepted by an api before implementing components based on it. another common issue is being rejected by paypal/stripe payments apis after implementing them due to bad business model or legal issues, costing you more money to redesign a part of the projects architecture. --- 5. cutting-edge tech cuts you first --- one of the teams you found is suggesting to use a revolutionary tech released one month ago, which is quickly on the rise and is better in every aspect than its predecessors. being one step ahead of the competition is another no-brainer, and you cant really judge experience on recently released tech because nobody had time to use it, right? while we recommend using technologies which are new and popular, always research the teams experience with said technology. most teams must swap to whats new and popular every few years, and if the proposed tech is too new, chances are theyre shoving it just to get their developers warmed up with their new architecture. even if its superior in every way, that new programming language will bring instability and bugs if the engineers are not used to it. theyll not be able to reuse tested components, the way they can with tech in their portfolio. sure, it has its advantages, like the code running faster because its better optimized and scales better with thousands of simultaneous users, but is this a real issue when youre a startup? unless absolutely necessary or the pros clearly outweigh the cons, we recommend to go with the tried-and-true, boring, stable tech stack thats still new, rises in popularity, but had enough time to be tested on the market.	charryw	/r/business/comments/afz7rh/i_sell_bespoke_software_since_2017_for_startups/	4	15	0	0.84	1547493366.0

should i present a profit sharing idea? any tips?	as the title states, i am working on the operations side of a business and the director and vp of operations have asked how we could improve moral and minimize mistakes. in my head i was thinking of proposing a profit sharing system operations would get 1% of monthly profit and divide it across all employees in operations . however if an incident report is brought up due to operation's mistake, then operations would not get that month's profit percentage. the following month will start a new clock on mistakes and profit sharing. new employees will not participate until probationary 90 days is completed. there would be an hourly rate and an annual pay increase of 2% . the corporate side of the house makes outrageous profits and berates operations for anything wrong with a shipment and threatens unemployment. i feel with these unnecessary pressures and blame directed at us it gives operations low motivation to perform and sacrifice more personal time to take care of shipments. with the profit sharing and 'no mistake' contingency, i feel it would inspire folks to focus to attention to details, foster more collaboration as a team to accomplish orders, make individuals feel more connected to the company and its goals, minimize mistakes/errors as a byproduct, instill pride individually. they all preach we're a family or a team but it's hard to believe when your department is treated like the red headed stepchild of the whole company. &; would it be career suicide or painting a target on myself if i propose such a plan? has anyone had similar experiences with this issue and what were the results? &;	cannibal_bunny	/r/business/comments/ant2qx/should_i_present_a_profit_sharing_idea_any_tips/	5	5	0	0.74	1549473959.0

a customer requests their logo on a custom piece which they intend to resell to their clients, i dont think that a fair request.	i do custom 3d models and 3d prints for customers, lots of original design work from scratch. i've always treated it that if the customer comes to me with their ideas, i do it without questions if possible. often they want their company name and logo on pieces for their personal use. today though i had a different request, a customer wishes to act as a middle-man and generate leads for me, using showpiece objects that i would make featuring his logo, which he then shows to his clients who would order from him, under the assumption that he made them. so in effect, his customers would have no idea that he outsourced it to me. of course if they asked him whether or not it was outsourced and he tells the truth or not is another issue, but i just have a feeling that promoting an object you didn't make, as a sales pitch of a service you don't offer, isn't very fair. i'm fully aware that without his acting as a middle man, those are sales i likely would never receive and so i should take any job i'm given. but is this crossing a line? are there ethical boundaries crossed when custom designed works are promoted under a false pretense of who actually made them, would they change in value if it was known that these pieces were in fact one-offs? i wonder if this is comparable to an artist who is commissioned to do, for example, a really fancy banner and print which would sit behind the front desk of some graphics design company, where the company owners signature is on the picture, but not the actual artist who drew it.

book of business, 12 years of work, want to step away. what to do?	i've been in real estate lead generation and marketing forever and due to family reasons, i want to step away. i have thousands of agent contacts, hundreds of whom i have actually worked with over the years who count on my advice and such. many huge key client types. current clients. i get several referrals weekly and have never even emailed my list. i feel like it's a big opportunity for someone or for me to sub it out to someone? or several someones? i called some companies today to ask about affiliate type programs. basically, i want to walk away but not lose a shit ton of hard work and value completely. and not put any of my clients out or cause them any upset. and make some money because i earned it and got screwed and i'm tired and just want to take care of my sick baby and sick partner and other various dependants and not have to deal with the rest. my family needs me so bad and i'm spinning a thousand plates and eventually, some will fall. i don't want to hit hard. i want to ease out slowly and carefully? i'm so lost. i have no support. i don't know what to do. i want to be better for my family. they deserve a version of me who isn't trying to do 1800 things at once and working constantly to supposedly be home with the baby i am working to be home with less than if i left the house. i want to be focused on my family at a time they desperately need me. bs part is i qualify for disability 10x over but because my ex refused to work and i was never willing to allow my children to miss meals or go cold, end up homeless i worked through major events and issues several times over. isn't that just the fuckin' worst? yes, we agree you meet criteria over and over but due to your status having worked and currently working, we can not approve your application. . and if they do approve it can take a year sometimes so i'm supposed to stop working, wait 6 months, apply, wait 4 months, likely get denied because everyone does, have to appeal and that takes 6-8 months. there are stats that say roughly 1 out of 3 get it but hell if i want to risk my family for the chance at the help i need after 1.5 years.... i'm so. freaking. exhausted. i just want to stop everything work-related because that's where all the stress comes from. the deep-reaching, heart-wrenching want to provide and will to ensure my kids are cared for. i just want to halt it all. just halt. but i refuse to let others down and i do not wish to walk away from all that i have spent my life, thus far, doing. any advice?	bbandmenak	/r/business/comments/apmxwe/book_of_business_12_years_of_work_want_to_step/	11	3	0	0.8	1549930145.0

how to delegate successfully and not micromanage - help!	okay, so i have a small business in south east asia. without meaning to be derisive or insulting, but the level of labour in these markets is not often the best educated, and significantly lacks in critical thinking skills. &; i do not think of myself as a serial micromanager. in fact i hate micromanaging. i instead prefer to teach, and empower my employees to try and accomplish their jobs themselves. however as we have grown, and our headcount has increased i am continuously becoming more more spread thin, as i continue to have to micromanage. this is resulting in a lot of important tasks falling thru cracks, and expensive mistakes happening left right and center. &; i am currently at a loss, as to what to do. if i am not micromanaging, the work does not get done properly, or to the standard that i need to. the best example i can give, is it took me two hours today, to break down with an employee from the accounting & receivables team just to find out how much customers owe us, and why what we were expecting to get paid is significantly lower than what was reported in sales. not to mention the fact that inventory is not updated, and getting financial reports is a week long task in micromanagement just to extract the data i need in a correct and updated manner. i have shown the team how i want things done a thousand times, and it feels if i'm not checking things on a daily basis it doesn't get done. &; this is an ongoing frustration and i am at a loss as to what to do. we have tried hiring more expensive employees, but i do not find that quality of competence increases relative to pay raise. furthermore i have found them snobby and unwilling to roll up their sleeves and do necessary grunt work as they expect to have an assistant' or someone to manage to do the actual bookeeping/admin/grunt-work and i cannot hire foreign or western educated people, as our current volume of business would not accommodate that, as we are not yet profitable. &; as such i feel like i'm in an endless spiral, never able to delegate, and crumbling under the stress of micromanaging too much. i am currently at a loss as to what to do, and am looking for advise on how i can change my approach in terms of management, hiring or otherwise. &; please note the average salary where i live is around 5-600 usd / month , with 500 - 1000 usd / month is considered middle class	sbalani	/r/business/comments/aprr2o/how_to_delegate_successfully_and_not_micromanage/	6	5	0	1.0	1549965090.0

partner wants to exit startup, what are my obligations?	a 1/3 owner of our new startup wants to exit. we want this to be a friendly exit so we are trying to come up with an offer that will make everyone happy, enough. the partnership agreement says that the other partners will have the option to purchase the shares from the existing partner but does not specify what happens if none of the partners want to purchase the shares. myself and my wife are the majority owners. the 3rd partner is probably expecting his entire investment back. he is suggesting it's been too long before the business is up and running and making money so he would like to be done with his part of the startup. there was no guarantee of time to go live, etc. i am wanting to make him an offer, if he wants to exit completely then he gets x% of his investment back and we'll consider it done. or we can buy back part of his investment and he can continue to have a partial stake in the company. in either case, i can't see how it's a fair situation for him to get his entire investment back as it wasn't a loan but a stake in the partnership. if we actually dissolved/liquidated the business it would be worth less than the original investment, which is, i think, one of my talking points. any insight in to dealing with this kind of situation?	whodkne	/r/business/comments/apxjla/partner_wants_to_exit_startup_what_are_my/	7	1	0	1.0	1550001743.0
i have no idea what i'm doing...	i am 32 years old, with two very small failed startups under my belt. i have been put in a position where i need to run and operate a failing family business , and i have absolutely no idea what i'm doing. the company has about 25 people, with accounting, marketing, warehouse logistics needed to be accounted for. . &; the company could be profitable if it was run better and i have no idea how to manage a company of this size. i made a previous post about standard operating procedures, but i've realized i'm in way over my head. &; - sales fails to bring in more revenue than the cost of manpower, and still need me to come to close key deals, and a single sales person seems to be unable to secure more than 12 meetings a week. - marketing does nothing to boost company growth unless i'm the one actually giving them tasks to do, and doing the marketing planning myself - warehousing never actually knows how much inventory we have - accounting basically act as data encoders/bookeepers, and never actually produce or look at reports unless i ask for them. - i'm the one having to make po's and co-ordinate logistics with suppliers &; the list goes on. &; - i'm posting because aside from my two meager startups, i have no formal business education. i did terribly in school , and ended up with an arts degree, and then unfortunately circumstances put me in a country where working was not an option, due to visa issues, so getting a startup visa was the next option. hence the startups. i am writing, because my days just go plugging holes regarding the above issues. furthermore, i see other companies around me focusing on growing, and able to address, what i consider to be fundamental problems, that should not be taking years to fix. beyond this i have questions such as &; - for some of the brands we work with, we have brand guides, who should be responsible of using these? do i need a marketing manager? do i need go contract an agency? do i hire an agency on a monthly basis? project basis? - do i need an accounting manager? - what about a sales manager? - how do i manage these problems if we cannot afford these managers at this time? - how the heck do i develop better sop's for the company?! - i don't even know exactly what everyone should be doing!? &; - the advice i've been given thus far is to hire a business consultant. i wanted to see if reddit could suggest the same or other alternatives.	sbalani	/r/business/comments/aq4sfw/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing/	19	4	0	0.75	1550049725.0
life advice on how to invest money and also do what i love	hello fellow reddit folks, i am looking for advice on how i can get out from the 9 to 6 grind, by investing the money i have at hand, and by living a simpler life , while also earning some money by doing something i really love. a bit more info i live in england, london, but i am from romania originally. i have left my country in 2011.i currently work as a structural engineer in london, but this is a stressful field of work, for not very much reward moneywise and from other aspects as well. i have inherited around 300 000 euros and 2x one bedroom newly built flats + 2x 3 bedroom newly built flats in bucharest, romania. i have rented out 1 of the one bedroom flat with 700 euros per month, however the market does not seem too friendly to be renting out the others, especially since needing to be furnished, will require around 40 000 euros more to do, and so i do not think this is worth spending, especially if a recession coming around. i have to admit i woke up with this inheritance in my possession and i am not too sure what to do. i find it not constructive for my wellbeing to do a 9 to 6 grind until i am 70 years old, especially in this condition. the original plan was for me and my girlfriend to move to spain, maybe buy some land, build a house , while having a good income from renting those 4 properties in romania. after having the rent secured, i was looking at making a coffee shop where i could earn more money and keep me busy, while also doing something i really love . besides the coffee shop, we wanted to have an airbnb as well. all these means we can remain close to nature and live simpler lives, far away from stress. but now since i cant rent those flats, this dream does not work anymore. i feel all i have left is to continue my 9 to 6 grind and thats it. i still want to make a life with my girlfriend in a country like spain or italy, but i am not sure what plans to make, so that we can make the most of this money. we will probably never have another shot at being able to use such an amount of money. can you fellow folks, recommend to me ways of investing this money? i am not talking about stocks investment where i have zero experience and its risky, i am talking about something safer. what would you do if you were in my shoes, what would your move be? how can i make the most of this money? for additional info, in case it would matter, besides being an engineer as a profession, i am a very good cook, make amazing coffees, do a lot of diy with wood, i write spiritual and philosophical articles on the net.but i have never been much of an entrepreneur. i cant seem to know how to make money, besides working for a company as an engineer. its driving me crazy but i am not sure how i can make money nor invest money.cant and don't know how to make money out of writing, even though my friends say i do so quite fine. there is also this option in which being an engineer, and loving interior design, and having experience with refurbishment and doing up a couple of apartments in terms of design and decor, i was also looking at putting this to work, combined with my diy skills, maybe buy bad houses and make them nice? some of my passions seem to go well with doing an airbnb or running a coffee shop, but thats just it.i am afraid i will lose the money. i am not sure what to do. how would you invest this money to make a simple and close to the nature living, while also not having a hard life. i am looking forward to see what you people would do, if you were in my shoes	alexdd88	/r/business/comments/aq7hb8/life_advice_on_how_to_invest_money_and_also_do/	3	2	0	1.0	1550070386.0

farm + bread and breakfast advice	hi reddit - it's been my life long dream to start a company. i never really knew what i wanted to do, but when i was 16 i spent a summer in boulder living with a family that owned a nice restaurant called the black cat. the owners also owned a farm which is where they sourced the majority of their meats and veggies. i worked on their farm and restaurant that summer and was super inspired by the way they ran their company and how passionate the owners were about their farm/restaurant. almost a decade later, i am trying to figure out how i can do something similar to what they did, but i am not sure where to start. my long-term girlfriend and i came up with the idea of starting a bed and breakfast on a farm where people can relax in a rural environment and experience what farm life would be like. the idea would be to source most of the food from the farm. i have a few questions that i would like to ask and i would really appreciate it if you guys could take the time to answer some/all of them. thanks a lot! &; question 1 what would be the best way to finance this venture? i currently have $75,000 in student debt so i don't really have any cash as it's almost all going to pay my rent and debt. i currently work for a big 4 accounting firm and make $70k a year. should i wait until i am in a better financial situation before i pull the trigger? &; question 2 where would be a good place to buy farm land that people would be willing to visit at a good price? i was thinking maybe somewhere in texas, but i would like to hear about some other hidden gems that i might not know about. &; question 3 what would be a good way to learn everything i need to know about farming? should i go back to school? are there any farming internship programs? &;	vinceblk1993	/r/business/comments/ar0233/farm_bread_and_breakfast_advice/	3	1	0	0.67	1550257937.0
how do ideas become reality?	my problem is that i don't know how or where to go to get my ideas materialised. so for example, if i want to make a set of watches how exactly would i do that? i do not want to just buy pieces from ebay or whatever and stick it all together and say that it's 'my watch', i want to actually have my own components custom for my own ideas... from the case to the strap to the face. but everytime i try find anything out about business all i get from google or books in the bookshops are stuff on 'how to be a better boss' or 'how to be better with time management' or 'how to maximise profits by listening to your audience'. why is everything targeted around that but nothing ever talks about how to actually get your designs materialised into reality? it's infuriating. some people say 'just contact a supplier' as if its the most natural thing in the world, as if its like doing something as common and simple as ringing up a plumber. i don't even know where to begin? seems like it's so obvious and common knowledge that it doesn't need to even be explained? i can't think of any other reason why i've never heard that side of it ever been discussed in my life. i have all sorts of ideas for fashion, shoes, watches, children's toys etc and many interests but literally not a clue on how to get anything put into reality. not even the slightest clue. it's not the running a business or having time management i want to read about in business books so where can i find the info i want out?

want to start a business as a teen - don't have the money for it	hey everyone, i'm new here and i'm writing on mobile so expect mistakes. i'm 14m, and i always wanted to start an online business, my only problem is not having the money. what i mean by that is i have some money and can ask my parents for some, too, but i don't want to tell them about what i'll be doing with it, and what makes this even harder is that i have to ask to use my dad's credit card, so i can't get away with something like i'll be buying a video game or anything like that. i don't want to tell them because they'll always have a reason to tell me to delay that, my mom being very rational with the reasons i have to admit, but my dad offers me small gigs to do for some money, and while i enjoy some of those gigs and make some good money off them - currently have 600 buck in his bank account - i want to start something on my own. i've already looked up those how to make money as a teenager articles but they usually offer stuff that are not common in my country or something you have to commit 50 hours into for you to earn 10$ in gift cards. i wanted to start a dropshipping electronic store on shopify but it's not supported in my country, i've tried to start a blog but found no free way to do so, mom supported my idea since she also had that idea, but she didn't go through with the idea, and i've tried to set-up a tee-spring store with my sister but since i had to go back to school and she had to go back to college - her college is in a different city btw - we had to cancel on that pretty quickly. i also learned how to program an arduino and made some pretty small projects with it, but i don't know how to turn that into a business. help me with that if you have an idea, please. i'd be glad to sell any video games i haven't played in a while to gain any extra money i need, but i'm sure 600 bucks is enough. also, if you know a good subreddit i can post this to, please let me know. thanks for reading!

business books are usually a lot of fluff and minimal substance - is there a book which neatly summarises popular business books while interlinking them?	i feel overwhelmed by the amount of popular must-read books and every time i read them they either have an idea that has been repeated over and over again, feel like they only mean to inspire, or they have one nice idea with 300 pages of fluff. looking for an organised and interlinked summary of the most popular business books if there is such a thing? not interested in a compendium of all books summarised back to back. the closest i have found is the personal mba by josh kaufman but it is too academic rather than practical. thank you all	ChronicTheOne	/r/business/comments/atp3pk/business_books_are_usually_a_lot_of_fluff_and/	6	5	0	0.86	1550882173.0

my thoughts on people who want to start a business but don't know where to start	hey all, &; hope all is well. &; it's a very common response that when i tell people that i work for myself and run my own business that they almost always respond saying, i've alway wanted to go into business. this then leads to a long discussion about business and entrepreneurship. &; it's an interesting conversation and one that i enjoy having, however what is typically concluded from this is that the other person has no idea where to start. from what i can tell and perhaps reading a lot on this blog is that most aspiring entrepreneurs feel that they need capital and a lot of it, to which i respond not really. as i discussed previously about my thoughts and experiences of a business startup in 2019, starting an online website with a brand and logo is relatively seamless. as explained, this can be done in 24 hours and with all the resources available to us now online you can literally be selling something the next day. &; in all honesty, it sometimes requires a little encouragement for someone to go into business and the fear of the unknown is a part of that. it's great to hear that when i mention my employment status that it motivates people to follow suit, although people want to pursue business i find that most do not really know where to begin. a situation that most do not want us to be in, but i've said it before and i'll say it again here; any idea can work providing you give enough dedication to it! &; feel free to comment and let me know if you agree, disagree or have a similar and or different perspective on the matter. &; regards, &; an entrepreneur	hefitsstore	/r/business/comments/ave0rx/my_thoughts_on_people_who_want_to_start_a/	3	8	0	0.8	1551277500.0

they are saying best buys trend bucking brick and mortar success is due to investing in better trained sales people. interesting how best buy pushed circuit city out of the market by originally hiring a less-trained lower paid sales force vs circuit citys trained and commissioned sales approach.	i worked at circuit city as a kid. i went through an extensive training program, not just on product knowledge but on how to sell. in-person trainings and online-based trainings. every month, i would complete training on new products. in addition to being paid an hourly rate , i also earned commissions on sales. this led to an incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and hard-working retail sales floor, something unfathomable by todays standards . then best buy opened down the street... with their pretty blue shirts... they hired at minimum-wage, maybe slightly higher, with no commission. and as far as any customer could tell, no real product knowledge. but, this was also the time when people were reading up on products online before heading into their brick and mortar stores to buy exactly what they wanted. no conversation needed. circuit city is paying their employees too much and goes out of business. now, with brick and mortar a shadow of what it was, people looking for that in-person experience, to see and feel the products in person, are being pleasantly surprised by knowledgeable sales people at best buy. good for them. a company that knows how to adapt. i glad because seeing empty strip malls is getting depressing. maybe circuit city can make a comeback?

when a brands image limits market reach a case study of a brand of electric guitar accessories i have gotten recently.	 ive been working with a new client who manufactures electric guitar accessories. i cant give away the exact product because of an nda and even mentioning the product would probably give away the company. in this market, there are three big manufacturers and many smaller boutique manufacturers. these aftermarket accessories can improve or dramatically change an instruments tone and are especially popular with professionals and to a lesser degree with hobby players. i made the case that the companys marketing and image are too limiting. i cant give an exact description but i will give a similar example with a differing product. lets say theres a company called nashville guitar strings or music city strings. both of these would give the impression that the product is geared toward country music players. rock, jazz, and other players might get the false impression that the strings werent for them. on the other hand, if there was a memphis blues guitar string company, then non blues players might feel the product wasnt for them, even though they might make a wide range of products ideal for any genre. another example would be detroit rock city strings, a name which might alienate players who did not play rock. like the above examples, my clientwho does not make strings but a different type of accessorycenters their brands name, the name of their products, and their entire image around a certain region which connotes a certain musical style. i dont feel that this is effective since their products are actually versatile, wide ranging, and ideal for all styles of music. the owners are open to suggestions and are considering my points. i also understand that many of their most popular products have name recognition and therefore shouldnt have their names changed. there are ways, however, in which the overall marketing can be adjusted without totally changing the companys image and without alienating their existing loyal customers. i hope to talk about some of these ideas more in future case studies. i am currently floating the idea of product endorsements in numerous musical genres. since the products are not that expensive, giving a few to recognizable name players and asking them to endorse would be a great way to gain a foothold in other genres. im also working on a plan to create signature products where a famous musician with high name recognition gets to design a product specific to his or her needs. this is a popular technique in the music industry and many other industries as well. stay tuned to further posts for more about these ideas. original post when a brands image limits their market reach original poster eric 	Yolofreelance	/r/business/comments/b3948y/when_a_brands_image_limits_market_reach_a_case/	7	1	0	0.66	1553067571.0

advice on first consulting meeting	hello. apologies in advance if this is not the right place for this. &; so, i manage a team in charge of the infrastructure and a whole lot of other stuff like automation at my current employment, but i used to do that myself at the beginning. there was a ceo that left due to the company being bought and there being some restructuring. &; hes now at another startup and contacted me about providing his cto some consulting hours. im curious, not for the exact amount of money , but on how should i approach that conversation. unfortunately i talked to the cto and setup the meeting but there was no talk about compensation; my bad. &; now, if you think i lost my chance to do it now, thats okay, like, if you think the meeting will now most likely start with me providing my expertise for free, but id like some general advice on how to first start the meeting and how should i leave things clear from the beginning for next opportunity , or even if i can still be clear about asking for compensation for this meeting, if its still salvageable even if there is some awkwardness during the meeting, that would be awesome. &; i saw this scene in the social network film, where they first meet with sean parker character and he leaves the meeting picking a check after providing some insight . i suppose the ones wanting to meet contacted him and he gave them a... i dont know the english word for it, the rate? the quota? anyways, that exactly is how i expect these consulting meetings to be for me from now on. any advice on that too? like some guidelines on how to do this kind of job/business. &; thanks again, and sorry for the long post.

when does a salesperson become successful?	so you employ salespeople. whether you have one salesperson or one thousand - the requirement is simple, they need to be making you money. but how do you judge this? do you judge it on the performance of the last month, the last quarter, the last year, the ongoing orders from their initial sales or the back end value their historical sales have added to your business? this is a really tough but really important decision. if you employ salespeople or plan to then it is vital that you decide how to measure their success or failures. i have worked with and for a number of businesses where theirrequirements of me were not clear. would they prefer that i deliver ten clients a month who spend 1000 each or one client a yearworth 300,000? the client whospends 1000 will be a significantly easier sale than the 300,000 spending client but what is better for your business? lots of regular income that covers the costs of the salesperson each month or more income in large bursts but with the addedcash-flow pressures of funding the salesperson while they try to win the larger deals? it is reallyimportant that you do not become the employer that wants it all ways. it is perfectly possible to have a good mix of sales but if you are one of the 4.9 million small businesses in the uk it is unlikely that you will have a salesperson delivering twenty clients every monthspending between 1000 and 300,000 anyway. you need to decide what your ideal client is. is it a client who makes just onelarge order or one that makes orders every month? is monthly profit or back end valueyour primary objective? can youachieve both? are the skills of thesalesperson suited togaining your ideal client?should your salespeople be focused on new businessonly or are theyrequired to look after existing clients too? these are all questions that youmust ask and answer before youemploy salespeople as these issues will arise constantly and will cause confrontation. i used to own a telecoms business. before it was sold in 2012 we offered ahuge range a products andservices ranging from telephone lines and calls through to telephone systems and maintenance contracts and even with clearly defined responsibilities there were conflicts constantly from hungry salespeople chasing every deal they could. if a salesperson sold a telephone system to a new client all was simple but what if that client wanted to spend another 20,000 after two months? who shouldrun that sale? the original salesperson or theaccount management team that looked afterthe customer post sale? we in fact worked out that the initial sale was of little value to us so we rewarded the salespeople very well for the initial sale and we retained the benefit of forwardbusiness. the salesperson was happy with the lions share of the profit on the original deal whilst we wanted the long term value from the client and managed therelationship thereafter and paid the salesperson a token percentage of all future business - this worked well as they felt there were getting something for nothing. only once you have considered, planned through and communicated the criteria can you start to measure the success of your sales staff. if your business is based around a single sale to a single client then clearly performance is easy to assess. but if you get an initial order and then lots of regular orders or other elements of your business are able to cross-sell products into the same client then the ultimate value gained from the initial sale can be much harder to measure. this complication can be increased if there are othersalespeople further down the line who are also making sales to the customer and need to have their success assessed. salespeople are veryterritorial and feel like they own every client they sell to and there are some arguments to back up why they should feel this way. they did, after all, win the clientoriginally and could therefore argue they are best placed to manage all the needs of the client. but then what happens is that you can have salespeopledoing very little work as they areable to earn significant income from the sales of their existing base and therefore new business can dry up. it is a challenging problem for many businesses. there is no right or wrong answer as every business is different but i think every decision you make in this regard should be solely based on what is right for your business. if you allow the decision to be clouded by the views of salespeople then you will regret it. of course you want to ensure people are rewarded for their performance but you pay commission for that. you do not pay commission to salespeople for them to demand anything beyond that reward.you need to make sure the targets of your salespeople relate to the needs of your business and then when targets are met you can be sure that your business objectives are also being met. this method will stop your salespeople making great money while your business is not progressing.

what percentage of a company's payroll is typically minimum wage workers?	i've become interested in the idea of cutting corporate taxes, but raising the minimum wage. if you had a rough estimate of how much a company's payroll would generally increase if the minimum wage were raised to $15, $18, $20, etc you could get in theory an idea of how much corporate tax would need to be cut to not burden companies but simply shift the burden from taxation to paying your workers a higher/livable wage. then the idea being that the cost of public assistance would dramatically drop, resulting in needing much less tax revenue , and probably about half of those lost taxes will be regained after they're passed on as higher income to the working and middle class, while also stimulating the economy and raising the quality of life of the working class. i know it obviously varies wildly on the type of business, some business probably don't have any minimum wage workers. but the idea is if some company's have 90% of their workforce working minimum wage, increasing the minimum wage to like $16 would double their payroll. but if only 50% were minimum wage worker, their payroll wouldn't increase as much, maybe only 30-40% or even less.	altaccountforbans1	/r/business/comments/bfm3qr/what_percentage_of_a_companys_payroll_is/	1	1	0	0.66	1555828777.0

how to manage high variance in potential client flow based on seasonality?	i manage sales for an 8~ million annual revenue landscaping firm. one of the things we struggle with is the immense amount of people contacting us in the spring, versus later in the year and winter. it seems as though everyone wants service as soon as the snow melts, which is understandable. the main issue is that we have 5 sales reps that can hardly keep up in the spring, and then end up twiddling their thumbs in other portions of the year. we do a lot of prospecting in slower periods, but the general interest in landscaping services at those times are very low. the salaries for the reps are not cheap. ive thought about temporary help in the spring, but it takes quite a bit of training to get them up to speed. newly trained reps do not put up half the numbers of guys with a few seasons under their belt. im not sure if there are solutions i havent considered. any advice or ideas are greatly appreciated		/r/business/comments/bgwnzf/how_to_manage_high_variance_in_potential_client/	2	1	0	0.67	1556123095.0

how to find new customers and increase sales	source in a perfect world, you would have an unlimited budget to market your business in order to find new customers and increase sales. you could buy lots of online and offline advertising, run promotions to build traffic in store and online, and launch a proactive public relations campaign to increase your product or brand's visibility and awareness. but this isn't a perfect world. realistically, most small businesses and even many mid-sized firms have more great ideas on how to peddle their wares than available resources. so where do you start if you are looking for more customers? learning to generate new sales leads is an essential skill for an entrepreneur. even if you don't consider yourself a salesperson in the classic sense of the willy loman character from arthur miller's play death of a salesman , you need to understand that the possibilities for finding new customers range from cold calling names from the phone book to buying lists of potential customers to using newer internet techniques like search engine optimization to drive new business to your website. the following pages will delve into how to conduct market research to understand your target audience and their needs, how to determine which lead generation techniques are best to broaden your sales horizons, and how to increase sales by following several strategies to sell additional products and/or services to existing customers. how to find new customers and increase sales understand your target audience before you can find new customers and increase sales, you need to understand who your customer is, what value proposition you offer to customers, and what your competition is currently offering in the market and where there are gaps for a new entrant. in other words, you need to do some market research -- whether that means hiring an outside firm to do the legwork or trying to do it yourself. there's an underlying disconnect between your motivation to increase sales and your customer's motivation to solve their problems. attracting more customers is really about listening to their needs, not being a solution looking for a problem, says paige arnof-fenn, founder and ceo of mavens & moguls, a strategic-marketing consulting firm whose clients include fortune 500 companies as well as early stage and emerging businesses. there are many existing problems out there that need to be solved that customers are willing to pay for today. how to find new customers and increase sales find out who your current customers are in order to develop a marketing plan to reach new customers, you need to better understand who you're already selling to. if i'm trying to expand sales, i have to find out who my existing customers are. what are their demographics? what do they look like? says jerry osteryoung, director of outreach for the jim moran institute for global entrepreneurship at florida state university. that means doing market research. market research runs the gamut from very simple qualitative research to in-depth quantitative analysis. it can be done very quickly and inexpensively by sending surveys to your existing customers using one of the many online survey tools, such as surveymonkeyor zoomerang. you can also get to know the target audience by looking at existing sources of information -- from the u.s. census bureau or other government agencies, from trade associations, or from third-party research firms. but depending on the questions you are trying to answer and your research budget, your market research can involve more extensive interviews with customers and qualitative studies on how target customers feel about your business, its products and services. certain products and services may appeal to one audience but not to another, so understanding the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in your target market is critical. you can get to know your customers and segment the market any number of ways including by demographics -- statistical data on a population including income levels, age, etc. psychographics -- the attitudes and tastes of a certain demographic. ethnographics -- examination of particular cultures. buying habits -- how, what and where customers purchase products and services. how to find new customers and increase sales defining the market for your product use the information about your existing customers to develop a target audience for your business in its drive to win new customers and increase sales. while there are core customers you are trying to reach, often there are other markets that are also important to address, arnof-fenn says. make sure you know who the gatekeepers and influencers are; they will affect the decision makers and you will most likely need to sell to them differently than to the end user. for example, parents might be the gatekeepers for products targeted to children or technology managers might hold influence over a company's decision to invest in new software. determine which key messages, features and benefits matter to each potential market. tell these customers how your business can help them solve their problems. in order to have a customer go to your online shop, you have to find a reason why these customers want to come to you, osteryoung says. the value proposition has to be spelled out clearly. next, you need to figure out where to reach these customers and whether there should be a marketing or advertising plan that goes along with that outreach. how to find new customers and increase sales generating sales leads there are a variety of age-old staple techniques and newer tools you can use to find new customers and increase sales. it's best to understand the range of choices you have in order to determine which may best help your business reach new customers. newspaper readers may not be moved by internet-based sales techniques. similarly, business people who are accustomed with hiring only people they know may be better swayed by meeting you at a chamber of commerce meeting than accepting a blind invitation to connect on linkedin or facebook. it starts with good people, says peter handal, chairman and ceo of dale carnegie training, the sales and leadership training organization. if you're a one-man shop, it's one thing. but if sales people are really important, you need to hire and motivate good people and you want to give them an upside, such as sales on commission. the motivation is not just money it's also helping them overcome the fear of prospecting. here is a rundown on the techniques available cold calling. this is telemarketing without the call center. it's a blind contact with a potential customer who isn't expecting a pitch. customer leads can be picked up through scouring newspaper articles or items, lists of leads that are culled by a third-party, or paying attention to people or businesses moving into your turf. people are always hesitant about cold calling or talking to someone they don't know, says handal. we coach people to give themselves a pep talk to get them in the mood. we suggest that they set a goal -- this is how many new people they will talk to this week. networking. this can be done the old-fashioned way, by getting involved in community organizations, such as the chamber of commerce, or attending business functions, such as trade shows. social functions -- dinner invitations, book clubs, etc. -- can also lead to potential business. all of those kinds of things are important ways to network to find new customers, handal says. networking has also taken a 21st century twist on the internet, with the rise in popularity of such websites as and plaxo -- using keywords and other techniques to make your site appear on the first page of listings on search engines -- has become an art form. there are websites, such as search engine watch, that will keep you updated about seo techniques. in addition, there are a growing number of paid seo consultants who can help you use all the tricks and techniques to improve your search results. you can also use a variety of blogs, chat rooms, podcasts, and webinars to generate awareness for your website and company. a website is a dynamic tool not a one-time experience. the top search engines are constantly updating their algorithms, so you must monitor your website on a regular basis to make sure your keywords are leading customers to you. make sure you are keeping your website up to date with fresh content so your customers come back often for more. advertising. typically businesses are encouraged to spend 3 to 5 percent of their revenue on advertising, but a small business needs to make sure that advertising is effective, osteryoung says. one way to do this is to ask your customers where they heard about you so that you can measure what is effective. in addition, you also have to carefully pick your markets for advertising to make sure you're reaching your target audience. if you're targeting an older audience, newspaper ads might be the way to go. but if it's gen x or y you're after, then you may be better off advertising online or on tv, osteryoung says. you've got to define your demographics before you develop your advertising or marketing plan. how to find new customers and increase sales sell more to existing customers in order to increase sales, many businesses believe the only way is to find new customers, but a number of experts say that this strategy leaves out an obvious potential source of new sales. it's much easier to get an existing customer to buy from you than to convince a new customer to take the plunge. they're forgetting about low hanging fruit -- their existing customer base, says osteryoung. if i want to expand sales, the number one place to go is the existing customer base. they already trust you. here's how to increase sales with your existing customer base bundle products. you can bundle a few products or services together for a special price to try to get an existing customer to try some of your other offerings. try the upsell. convince your sales staff to go back to existing customers and try to sell those clients related products or services. a common example is a warranty, osteryoung says. think of how many times you've purchased electronics and a sales person has tried to sell you on an extended service plan. customers sometimes take the bait. offer inside information. if a customer is eyeing a product but about to put it back on the shelf, make sure you let them know that the product is going on sale the following week. if you monitor your website's online shopping cart, you may email an existing customer who didn't complete a sale and offer them a discount to complete the purchase. think about customer rewards. like the airlines have done with frequent fliers, there is no reason a small business can't reward good customers with a loyalty program. offer a discount on their birthday or for every 10 purchases give them one for free. give free samples. offering freebies isn't necessarily going to cost you an arm and a leg, but it can increase sales by engendering good feelings among existing customers, convincing them to pass on the sample to a friend or family member, and/or convince them to buy your latest hand cream or ice cream flavor.	mydreambusiness	/r/business/comments/bi3c57/how_to_find_new_customers_and_increase_sales/	9	1	0	0.67	1556397540.0

22yo w/ unique off grid lifestyle needs honest advice	i have been traveling the usa full time for the past year in a custom built off grid camper that i invested my previous bartending income into. at 22 i now own my living space, have no car payment, no student loans, and low monthly expenses. i am trying to build myself multiple sources of remote income as a foundation for a lifetime of financial/physical freedom. i have a shopify website where im currently only blogging keyword topics in my niche and a youtube channel that matches style. i have income through affiliate marketing, youtube patreon supporters, and handmade art as of now. id love to invest into some products that require more focus of my time on sales than production. if i had a few good products to bring in some extra revenue, i know i can market them in my niche, reinvest, and grow a brand. my lifestyle only calls for about $500 a month to cover bills and most living expenses, and i dump the extra into gear/services that will create a more efficient overall system of workflow. i live in remote locations around the country and my off grid setup allows for free primitive camping on public lands which means no rent bill! however, working through internet requires trips to the nearest town to get wifi. im using my bartending tax return to invest in a signal booster and an additional $30 monthly on my phone bill for a hotspot as this will allow for unlimited internet no matter where i am therefore cutting my gas expense that adds up quick. any suggestions on a next move going forward to create a new income stream? first products or services that require low initial investment? thankyou so much to any who reply! cheers!

does anyone else get customer anxiety?	i don't know what it is but it literally keeps me asleep at night. sometimes it's all i can think about even when i know things are ridiculous. for example if i don't make a customer happy, or something like my dog scares a customer out of the shop. it becomes my entire day, all i can think about are all the worst possibilities of what could happen from my dumb ass dog scaring someone. or even something as simple as just not making a customer/client totally happy with their visit. sometimes it is as if they are offended that i don't have everything or exactly what they need at that moment and it's all i can think about that week, never the happy customers. and today first thing in the morning i had a client pick up his car we had fixed something that wasn't perfect the last time he picked it up. i knew it was fixed and ready to go. but last night i couldn't sleep, all i could think about was when he was going to come in and pick up his car. what if for some reason all of the sudden it wasnt fixed like it was on saturday? now i'm a incompetent idiot and this guy is going to wonder why he/anyone else ever even trusted me in the first place. i think i'm going crazy, i know that one customer or one thing isn't going to work out all of the time. that's just how the world is. but all i can think about are those times it didn't work out, or worst case scenarios or anything along those lines. does anyone else have these issues? how do you cope?

why i switched from freelancing to agency?	hey guys, i wanted to share a few ideas with you, i hope it will help a few of you here. lets start with my background story. i was the guy who always changes his mind. the guy who started something and then in the next second starts the other thing. i always had a great idea started it but never finished it. something has changed in the last few months, i realized many things, and i want to share it with you guys. what ive learnt in the last few the following &; always set a goal and give yourself a deadline/timeframe. if you start something always finish it. start it with small milestones but always finish that thing. not just in business but in your personal life too. eg if you set a goal for not eating junk food for 30 days then finish it, dont give up. after the 30 days, you can decide that you want to continue or not. think big but start small its a clich but its true. know your triggers, i always started things because of money but money is not my trigger. my trigger is that i want to improve, grow i want to become better. whats yours? &; now im switching from freelancing to agency type business. you may ask yourself why does he want to build an agency? i have 3 reasons for that. the first reason is simply that i want to grow. i have 2 options i create courses or i can build an agency many times i micromanage things and want to solve problems alone, but i realized that i couldnt solve every problem alone. i cant be the best in everything, and i cant provide excellent service alone. every one of us has only 24 hours in a day, and thats just not enough to be the best in everything. its only enough to be the best in one thing. and the most important reason is that i want to grow as a person. i want to be a great leader, a great influencer, and i want to help people. i want to be an example. if i want to become a leader, i have to think like a leader now. so my goal whit this agency is to reach the first 1 million in 2020. if you have any advice that can help me in this journey, dont save it for yourself 	tamasfogt	/r/business/comments/bp1joq/why_i_switched_from_freelancing_to_agency/	2	0	0	0.5	1557944833.0

what are some companies that decided to shutdown or pivot because they realized their business model was morally questionable?	i remember hearing that social media companies like facebook/twitter went from having a purpose of keeping keeping people in touch to focusing on keeping people engaged once they went public. now it seems that they've taken psychological research to go to whatever lengths it takes to keep people on their phones, viewing content and essentially making us as addicted as possible to viewing our smart phones. personally, i view this as a morally questionable goal. i feel our addiction to our smart phones has had a negative effect on our culture and livelihood. i feel like the response most current leaders of companies have is if we don't do this, someone else will, and they'll be the ones making money off this instead of us so we might as well keep going are there examples of companies or businesses or even entire industries that have shutdown due to the mass realization that what they were doing is bad? how nice would it be if fracking wasn't a thing anymore or... i dunno, if fire arms companies decided that they want to stop wars instead of keeping them going?

how should i decide what percentage split to create with an investor	first, i understand this is case by case, get what you can and all that. i'm asking in hopes of hearing what is too low, too high, or if there is some loose formula to figure this out. &; i took over a small business two years ago and it's doing fine now. i have a product that would help businesses in my industry earn more. the product/service would sell for $3500. the pitch and hope would be the company would earn $100-500 a week from their purchase. the profit on our end would be $700. there would be options for monthly service fees or dips into generated profit for further management fees. &; i have spent over a year getting the product right and have implemented it in my store. i'm excited about it and about the potential to help small businesses increase their chances of success. the current plan is to use the $3k a month i have in profit and add another six to my store over the next 8 months and then expand further, within my store. &; instead, i'd like to start a second company and find an investor to fund this product/service. this would allow me to cash the money out of the small business for myself instead of living tight for another 2 years while this goes. it would allow us to grab market share rather than increase my small business. my only real edge is time, nothing is proprietary. being b2b, this is scalable and although i know i'm sharp and dedicated, i would benefit from help. although i'd be open to a passive partner. &; to hit the ground, i'd need 25k, 50 is more sensible as we could offer a higher end product to accompany the current one. 100k is the high end. &; let's say 50k gets an investor 50% of profits until they are repaid. this follows a 1-2 year grace period where no money comes out. i'd want a salary, when possible of $500 a week. once the initial investment is paid back, percentage drops to 20%. &; i have a few people i can pitch to . &; how does this sound as far as being fair?		/r/business/comments/btoptl/how_should_i_decide_what_percentage_split_to/	5	0	0	0.5	1558977989.0

how to sell anything to anyone in 2019	 1. understand your customers needs no matter what you are selling, the most important part of salesmanship is understanding the needs of your customer and figuring out how to meet them. in almost every case, a salesperson who focuses on customer service and how a product is able to meet their customers needs and wants will be much more successful than a salesperson who focuses on the features and specifications of the product itself. 2. learn how to sell yourself whether youre cold calling or have spoken before, its important to keep in mind that before a person is going to be willing to hand over their hard-earned money to you, theyve got to like you the salesperson just as much as they like the product that you are selling. when youre making a sales pitch, take a little time to get to know your customer and let them get to know you. tell them a quick story, make them laugh, and overall simply let your personality shine. 3. research who youre selling to before you are able to meet the needs of your customer and craft your sales pitch to target them as effectively as possible, you first need to know as much as you can about the person you are selling to. sometimes increasing sales entails researching a specific client if you are making a major sales pitch to a high-profile figure within a company who you are able to research beforehand. 4. ask questions making sales centers around having a conversation with the person that you are selling to, and one of the most important parts of that conversation is the questions that you ask. asking your customer questions is valuable in a couple of different ways. for one, it allows you to figure out more about the person you are selling to, their needs and desires, and what they are looking for in a product. 5. dont sell. help people you are selling to need to see you as someone who is helping them solve a problem through the product that you are offering. keep in mind that one of the main things that lead people to buy a new product is that they are struggling with an issue that they hope that product will address. its your job, therefore, to make sure that you are as helpful as possible. how do you plan to double or triple your sales this year?

how i created a candy selling empire in my high school	at the end of summer i quit my job. so i did not have a source of incoming coming in any more. so i needed to figure out a way to make money for the school year so i could do stuff with friends. i am in lots of sports so i did not have enough time to get a job. so i came up with the idea of selling candy. so i went to sams club and bought the big packs of starburst and sour patch kids and watermelons. i also bought takis. i bought the watermelons and sour patch kids for a 24 box for about $12. so i sold every pack of candy for $1. so i made $12 every box of candy i sold. i then bought a box of starburst of 36 packs for $20, so i made $16 in profits after every pack i sold. i then bought a box of takis with 48 packs for $10. i then sold the packs for 50 cents each making lets just say around $20 a box of takis after i sold everything. i would then get all of my candy and probley spend around $80 every trip to sams. i would then go on instagram and snap chat and post on them telling people the prices of the candy i was selling and telling people they could pre order from me before i sold out. so the first day i started selling i sold around 30 packs of candy. making around $25 a day. this went on for a month at a time. but then people got bored and stopped buying. i would also only sell during class not lunch. so after about a month of selling sales started to drop so i stopped selling for about a month. the reason for this is funny. for example people love drugs. when you have people on drugs they need it. when they don't have their drugs they go crazy. so when a crack head does not has his drugs he wants them more then ever before. so that is what i did with candy. so i stopped selling for about 1 month and people starting begging me to sell again. because they were used to getting candy everyday but could not anymore. so after 1 month of not selling i would sell again. so sales would go up again. so over the course of last year i would sell for maybe a month and a half then stop selling for 1 month. i did this over and over again. i never did get in trouble for selling candy. teachers would see me selling candy and either be impressed or did not care. at one point i even had people working for me and giving a percentage of the sales they made. i would be the only one buying the candy i would supply them the candy for them to sell for free. i also had people try to compete against me but i would eliminate the competition. what i would do is make deals with my competition. so i would tell them to only sell chocolates while i sold sour candies and takis. the reason for this is because if we both sold the same candy we would both loose. because we would have to split the amount of customers we could be selling to. i also had a bigger amount of customers and i would tell them this so they would not sell my candy. or i would get my competition to work for me and they would sell my candy and get some of the profits that they sold. so i never had any competition for people trying to sell my candy i sold. i also never got in trouble for selling candy. they also later on installed vending machines at my high school. this was rly good for my business. the reason for this is because more people would bring money to school to buy snacks at the vending machine. but the problem the vending machines had was that they were very expensive. they would sell starburst or sour patch kids for $1.50. while i sold the same candy for 50 cents cheaper. they would also sell 1 pack of takis for $1. while i sold them for 50 cents a pack. so what i would do is take pictures of the vending machine prices and tell people my prices. i would post this on social media. so the vending machines got me more sales. so my sophomore year of high school i made around $1,500 in profits of selling candy. i would only sell during class. i also used social media so customers would come to me. so i created a black market or cartel of selling candy at my high school. p.s. sry for any grammar mistakes,	charlie3676	/r/business/comments/bxpe1a/how_i_created_a_candy_selling_empire_in_my_high/	8	2	0	0.6	1559875019.0
need help	so a friend of mine wants to invest in my business. i am a owner operator, he wants to invest approximately $6,000 for 25% of my company and wants a 40% return. the $6,000 will be used for a new lease truck, that we worked out the numbers for after expenses and paying the driver roughly $1,000 a week profit. he wants 40% of the profit weekly. but wants 100% for 6 weeks to get back his invested money. is this good for me or should i keep working and build the capital myself. which with the truck i own is a bit hard. the lease truck would be a brand new truck 0 miles with warranty. only expenses would be taxes, maintenance,breaks etc... we except the lease truck to last about 2 years before any major break downs which than the lease warranty would cover any major break downs i am so stuck i dont want to give him a percentage of my company. i do want to expand and acquiring this lease will help me achieve my goal 3x faster.	cyberhidden	/r/business/comments/bycd6g/need_help/	13	6	0	0.86	1560026718.0
science behind why a business plan is so important to the success of your business and how do you create one	a study was published in 2010 that combined research on the businesses and their growths. it included 11,046 companies and the study found the. interestingly, this same study found that planning benefited existing companies even more than it benefited startups. another study was done, and it found that businesses that planned grew 30% faster than those that didn't plan. it did find that businesses can find success without planning, but that businesses with a plan grew faster and were more successful than those that didnt plan. they also found for these companies, more detailed planning is generally more helpful, so it does matter what you include in your business plan. how many of you write business plans? i think people tend to forget or gloss over a business plan when setting something up online. however trivial you think it is, i highly recommend you look into creating one. there are plenty of free and paid resources out there to assist you in creating one.

need some business pitch advice	so i recently had an idea for a website that i frequent. i've been doing extensive research into the company and the idea and have put together a pitch with demos and what not. i have two questions first is how do i go about contacting this company? they do not advertise their contact information due to the content they create. would open them up for harassment by their fans and what not. i have no ties to this company or know anyone that has any contact with anyone so pretty big wall to get past it seems. however i do have a degree and several years of experience in the field that i am attempting to pitch to this company. the only idea i can come up with is linkedin but it seems that contacting people on this app is very unreliable. &; second is that even if i do get a meeting what can i do to try and minimize the chances that the company turns down my idea and then starts working on their own version of it the second the door closes. any info would be helpful!

should i outsource my startupyes, the whole thing? what about giving equity to my contractors?	so, i know there's a lot of stigmas around the practice of outsourcing tasks for early startups, particularly software development. the common wisdom is if you're not technical, find a technical co-founder. that's it. if you can't find one, you're effectively setting yourself up for failure. well, i've been running a little startup since february, and i've committedand continue to committhe cardinal sin of outsourcing development for my product. despite all the hate around outsourced development, i can only say that i've been extremely satisfied with my experience. i love everybody on the team, especially the co-founders. they are truly passionate about my project, and besides that, they are great people to hang around. we're always laughing and having fun, yet we're still completely motivated and driven toward pushing our mvp forward. we're all young, too, so there's a lot of shared ground in terms of values and culture. in fact, the founders used to run their own startup not too dissimilar to mine. who would have known? i have unreserved faith in them, and we all see each other working together on our project for the long haulthat is to say, for as long as it stays alive. the team is extremely agile and multidisciplinary. we have ux/ui designers, fullstack developers, and so on. i'd like to say i know most of them quite well, enough to talk about things outside of work. we schedule face-to-face meetings on an as-needed basis, and we always have daily communication. basically, my sentiment is even if i did raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital, i would continue working with themprobably even more intently than before. in my mind, they provide more personal and professional value than any developer/co-founder i could find. in many ways, they understand my business better than i do. after all, we've been working together since day 1. i know this is an unpopular opinion; many successful founders will say that i'm naive, that i'm doing it all wrong. perhaps, but i don't think so. i really don't. &; question 1 should i outsource my entire startup? alright, scary question. maybe a bit of clarification can i build my entire team based on outsourced workers and still run a successful tech startup? seeing as i've had such an amazing experience working with my outsourced development team, i'm curious as to whether it's possibleexcuse me, whether it can somehow prove favourableto just outsource all the other functions as well marketing, accounting, and so on. i've already found a few growth hacking agencies who i've handpicked. the assumption here is that i can find reliable, hardworking agencies just like the one i have now. not some shabby, indian outsourcers working for $10/hour. obviously, i don't mean a delegation of duties at all. i consider myself an extremely micro-managerial founder, and i try to be as involved in the processes that go on inside my company as possible. let it be made clear i still intend to run the company as ceo. so, naturally, i would set up cross-functional communication , strategize with the teams collectively, and do everything that a normal startup wouldexcept outsourced. in my opinion, if you can find the right partnersand here, i emphasize the word right then it makes all the sense to do so. it's cost-effective, and chances are, it's much higher quality work. what do y'all think about this? &; question 2 back to the software agency i work with. the founders, in addition to the technical work they do, are very keen on helping me with business development and finding investors. naturally, i've kind of wondered is it possible to just strike up an equity agreement with some of the core team members ? has anyone ever tried this? should i ask them? &; tl;dr work with an awesome team of outsourced developers, designers, etc. and get along really well with the co-founders. 1. in light of this, does it make sense to outsource all of the other major functions of an early tech startup as well, providing i can find similar partners and still take the helm as ceoe.g., marketing, accounting? 2. should i consider offering these outsourced workers equity, signalling an even more serious relationship?	pyang6641	/r/business/comments/c47aiv/should_i_outsource_my_startupyes_the_whole_thing/	4	4	0	1.0	1561307503.0

how does a small business get away without paying taxes?	so completely making up this imaginary scenario.. let's say there's two penguins that own a dog grooming company and a burger joint. they both don't report taxes and pay their employees with cash. the employees are also paid by the day and not the hour. they happen to hire people that struggle to find a job or are people that just got out of jail/prison. they have 5 locations of the dog grooming company and one location for the burger joint. my question is.. how do they get away with this?! i would assume the penguin revenue service would be on to them, but they've been running the business for over 5 years without any issues with the prs. and if they fire an employee, there's no proof the employee has ever worked there because they never signed any paperwork or anything. btw a seal used to work for the grooming place and found out about all this because the seal knew the penguins' daughter.	jonathanthegreater	/r/business/comments/caa7ol/how_does_a_small_business_get_away_without_paying/	5	1	0	0.67	1562524655.0

how much do rappers make?	i just read a thing where chief keef said to the court in a child support case that he only makes 9k a month? how can that be true? that doesn't even sound rich at all and especially in la that sounds like upper middle class just affording a nice house in the suburbs or something like that not rich. but he had a mansion, sold it, bought another one, has a bmw i8, a couple other nice cars, and he's constantly buying like a ton of 2,000 dollar shoes and outfits that cost thousands of dollars and stuff. that sounds impossible to be making 9k especially because asap rocky being locked up i read something in the news like he lost over a million dollars worth of touring and he's been locked up for a week lol. how can a rapper on the same level be making 1 million in a week but chief keef is saying he makes like 9k a month? and if rappers were really making 1 million in a week in touring why is their net worth only like 3 million or something like that? does chief keef only have the mansion and cars and stuff because when he first got signed they gave him a few mil and he's been riding off that and now that he has the mansion and cars he just uses the 100k a year he makes spending money on himself and stuff? rappers whenever something happens and they cant tour they say they are missing out on millions by not touring but then their net worth isn't even higher than 1 million? or a few million? why? did chief keef lie to the court? wouldn't they go over all his tax information and stuff like that and see if he was lying or not?		/r/business/comments/cbq507/how_much_do_rappers_make/	7	1	0	0.57	1562812418.0
i need advice on what to do. 50/50 equity split, member own llc. both wants to take full ownership. neither party is caving in	so i'm 20 and 2 years ago when i was 18, i opened a real estate investing business with a semi-experienced real estate investor, and who i thought was close friend. the business made absolutely no money . i lost contact with the other owner about 3 months ago, and i found out that the bank account is negative $600 and the bank contacted me to pay since i am 50% responsible for financial transactions. i talked to bryan and he has been using the money for some purchases and has not been taking proper care of the business. i now want take full control of the business and he want's $700 in claims that's his investment back for the business. i only am offering him $100, because he didn't do shit with the business while i was putting in most of the work. now he wants to pay me $100 to give up my equity so he can take full ownership. i stated no, because i would want my full investment back as well. we both own 50/50 and it's a 2 member managed llc in florida. he lives in rhode island, but i live in florida and i take care of most of the business operations. now that i am making money in my other ventures, i want to take this business and change it up to make money as well. i can't when he is eligible for 50% of everything that comes in. &; with that stated, what can do make this frustration go away? currently, we are at a stalemate. the bank will close down the business bank account and i don't want to be financially responsible for any of his actions in the near future. &; he's stated to not to do anything without the price of being $700 at closing. i gave him a similar ultimatum.	tycooperaow	/r/business/comments/cbr8yg/i_need_advice_on_what_to_do_5050_equity_split/	5	1	0	0.67	1562819242.0

investing in a fast food franchise with someone who has zero capital	hello. i have a friend who ran a chain of pizza shops earlier in his life and wants me to invest with him on a new franchise. i have the money, he has none and bad credit. this obviously alarms me and his home is in his mother-in-laws name. during some casual conversation, he wants it structured as 50/50 - i stopped him right there and said no way. too much can go wrong, what if he leaves, destroys business, he has zero flesh in game. thoughts? think i pretty much made my case to say no. edited i considered setting up heavy metrics of accomplishment levels to give incentives.	methos3000bc	/r/business/comments/cc1az3/investing_in_a_fast_food_franchise_with_someone/	5	1	0	1.0	1562879046.0

please advice me on how to improve sales of my product.	so my product is a transport pass card where customers can use it on a public transport in my town.i have co-branded with the public company in my home town to be able to sell transport cards at the stations around the town . i have also set up booths for my staff to sell these cards but it seems that the sales have dropped significantly during this month. so i am seeking on advice on how to improve my sales. &; 1. i have given incentives/ commissions to any booth that sell cards above the average. 2. i have co-branded with different brands in the market to come up with new design cards so i can attach more customers to buy new cards 3. i have wholesaled the cards to businesses for them to give to their customers any advice for me to increase the sale? i think the main reason that the sales decreased is because of the staff didn't work hard enough during the past month. i have put supervisor to check them regularly but obviously they cannot be there all the time. some booth have more people that other so i have to rotate every month so they get the chance to earn incentives at the station that is very crowded. it's not just the sales that i need i would like my customers to bind their cards with our application so they can use it as a e-wallet and increase my users. please advice me if you have any good idea. thank you very much.	jay12632	/r/business/comments/cc9a14/please_advice_me_on_how_to_improve_sales_of_my/	2	2	0	0.67	1562928383.0

advice for investing in a friends business	i have 2 friends that work as mechanics for a dealership. they have talked about starting their own shop so they can work for themselves. they both do good work and have connections so i don't doubt that they would be successful. one of them talked to me about potentially going in with them. i told them i wanted them to succeed and would offer any help i could . i also informed him that i wouldn't leave my current job for them as it is a well paying job that i've worked hard to get. because of my full time job i wouldn't be able to spend a ton of time helping them. also, i don't have the technical skills to help them working on cars. most of my input would be on the 'running a business' side of things which i am inexperienced with. obviously if i invest money i would like some financial return if the business is profitable. this is all still in the conversation phase but assuming it moved forward does anyone have any advice to investing in a business started by a friend without being able to contribute much?

suggestions for a sticky hr situation	an employee came to me to discuss issues she was having with her team. they seemed unmotivated and directionless in the project they were supposed to be working on. i recommended a few organizational management strategies to help address this problem. it turned out that the team members were unclear on what was expected of them. i tasked this employee with laying out weekly goals on a reasonable timeline to hammer out this project with her team. i also suggested she present them with an anonymous questionnaire about their expectations of her. it turned out some of the team members werent on the same page. they were all from different departments and some of them were from different generations where a different degree of conduct in the workplace was deemed acceptable. one of the younger female employees who we will call brithany was taking issue with the way she was being addressed by one of the older male employees who we'll call herb, who was brought in from the logistics department. she was not appreciative of him addressing her as honey or sweet cakes. i decided to prescribe the two of them a pow wow at patricks pizza parlor. unfortunately, they seemed to reach a stale mate at the pow wow, even though i was there to arbitrate. neither employee would give an inch. herb thought it was ridiculous that hed have to change his behavior after working at the company for over 20 years. we tried to negotiate, and perhaps find some middle ground. i suggested that he be allowed to continue to call her sweet heart or honey as long as he kept physical contact to a minimum, as well as retiring the name sweet cakes. he was not willing to budge on this one. on the other hand, brithany felt that she didnt want him to be allowed to address her at all, in any way, including by her name. she proposed that all their communication should be done by email, using aliases to avoid any uncomfortable situations. unfortunately this would slow progress tremendously, seeing as they need to be in constant communication to proceed with this project. the male employee argued that this was ridiculous, as they worked two desks apart. regrettably after about 10 minutes of negotiations, they came to a complete standstill. brithany, became increasingly unresponsive. she refused to look up from her phone and would only communicate with groans. anything that herb or i said to her was met with a long drawn out sigh. on the other side, herb seemed distracted throughout the entire meeting. his attention seemed to be drifting away from me and my attempt to amend the situation, and over to brithany who he seemed to stare at unrelentingly. this seemed to make her very uncomfortable which is possibly part of the reason she shut down about 10 minutes into our discussion. i was dismayed as in addition to all this, herb had eaten about two thirds of the pizza i ordered for both of them at this point, and had put the rest in a to go box. it was unclear if brithany felt comfortable having more than the one slice i had served her, which was clearly a bad sign for two people that were supposed to be working on a project together. how do you suggest this situation be remedied?

starting a religion. how do i make honest money at this?	let's get this out of the way yes, starting my own religion is an insane idea. i'm not trying to swindle anybody, or be any kind of savior/cult leader, so when i say honest money, understand that i mean that my intentions are honest and let's not debate the veracity of various religious ideas. i just want to build a community of like-minded people and spread a little hope. think meditation group meets book club but with spiritual overtones. i want this to be my full-time career, to be able to have a location and a staff, and i want to grow it rapidly, all of which is going to require money. now, all the information i can find on making money with religion is either tongue in cheek attacks on the greed of religious/cult leaders, or christian prosperity gospel schemes that guilt people into giving up their money for the promise of blessings later. my religion is pretty secular, and guilt/blessings aren't really a thing. so far my monetization ideas include donations, and a book about the basics of the religion. long term, when growth is good i would like to hold workshops. how else can i monetize this so that it can thrive?

business question about language and choosing what languages to put on a product and why.	the title may seem a little confusing, but let me explain. i'm from florida, and whenever i look at products in my area i see most of the time english and french are put on the products, no matter what they are. i rarely ever see spanish placed on them and it's making me wonder why is it that way. in florida spanish is a predominant language here with culture, speakers, immigrants, you name it. but again, on most products you can buy at your walmart, or even local grocery store, they are in english and french. i don't have a problem with that at all, i love linguistic diversity, especially since i love languages too. but i don't understand why that's the case. i'm also new here, i don't know lots about business, i just want to see why companies choose french over spanish. so i apologize in advance if i sound ignorant or if i overlooked something. thank you!

what growing my business to 25+ employees in less than 6 months has taught me	during this crazy journey, i've learned a lot, and i'll put it into a list 1. got business dreams? don't put it off, start today. 2. fear failure? you will fail. keep pressing on. 3. own a business? why aren't you investing in yourself? 4. what could making $100k more every month change you and your family's life? i know how it has impacted mine, and its been able to impact so many people around me. 5. the final thought for this post, is that change and growth are good! maybe scary at first, but after being able to help make an impact in so many people's lives, i wouldn't change it for the world!	ccw1117	/r/business/comments/cjgj3y/what_growing_my_business_to_25_employees_in_less/	1	0	0	0.36	1564430428.0

a simple question about company ownership 	okay so i have 3 questions. 1 if i found a tutoring service business all alone without anyone involved and by using only my own money and make it grow, and then somebody asks to buy 50% of that business entity, is that business entity 'before it's sold' a company or a 'sole proprietor' or both? i think it's a sole proprietor, not a company because i did everything by using my own money. am i right or wrong? 2 shark tank show investors want to buy 50% of my the tutoring service business for $10k. is that $10k my personal money because i sold 50% of my sole proprietorship ownership? or does that 10k belong to the sole proprietorship business? &; 3 if i buy a tiny share of apple inc's stock and then sell it for $1000, that $1000 is completely my own personal money that i can use for whatever i want right? then with the same token, if a member of a company sells his 10% share of the company's equity to someone else for $100k, is that $100k completely his own personal money or does that money have to be used for growing the corporate business?

how i sold my first $50k in course sales from just a free facebook group d	yesterday was a mammoth milestone for me. i've struggled with health issues, mental blockers and lack of motivation for many years now. yet, i was still determined to break through those barriers. i launched my first course just over three months ago and this is the current result of my efforts. i actually achieved the first $50k without running any ads either! this was all done organically with a facebook group.how? i added value in other groups and engaged with anyone that responded to my posts. if it felt suitable, i would invite them to my facebook group. pinned to the top of that group was a case study video and sales video rolled into one. they were hot leads, they joined the group, they saw the video and they purchased my course.pretty easy! hands up who has a course? i'd love to hear how you have done in terms of marketing it. i've since beefed up my efforts with paid ads, but that first $50k milestone with just an organic group is something i'm proud of and would be happy to share any helpful tips to you guys. i've actually just put together an intimidate group where i'm sharing my best organic course launch tips, feel free to join right here 	carlosisis	/r/business/comments/cmmx5z/how_i_sold_my_first_50k_in_course_sales_from_just/	2	0	0	0.44	1565072263.0

what are some good crms for restaurant business?	hi! i'm researching the digital side of the sales processes in the restaurant business. i'd like to know what crms are you using and what kind of experience you've had to go through. as of now, i understand that i will need a crm that supports certain pos systems . i also see that some crms already offer a built-in pos system. i'd like the crm to track customers' orders, bookings, time spent, profiles, and personal preferences. it would be also necessary to track facebook ads and maintain a social media page on fb and instagram. i also expect that this crm can be used for waiters with their personal ids and the tables they've served with a digital menu. likewise, i need an app built that would integrate with the crm too. would certain crms be a hassle for developers because of their specific code or is that something that can be solved by api? the app is primarily going to be used for pizza delivery. so, any tips on this?	sonlc360	/r/business/comments/coykcs/what_are_some_good_crms_for_restaurant_business/	4	2	0	0.67	1565539701.0

i want to open an entertainment venue in my community.	i live on the island of molokai, hawaii; population 7,350, main city kaunakakai. there's no entertainment venues like a cinema, bowling alley, or arcade on island anymore, they all shut down when i was a little kid. i am sick of having to take a $110+ round trip flight to oahu or maui to be able to do this kinda stuff. our last cinema shut down on april 3, 2008 because the company that ran it wanted to develop 200 lot houses in undeveloped land, and the community protested it, so they shut down all their operations and left the island. our last arcade shut down in late september 2013 , because kids were climbing on top of the machines and slamming/abusing them. our last bowling alley shut down before i was even born. i want to reopen at least one of these things in kaunakakai, but what kind of hoops would i have to jump through, and does this sound like a feasible thing to try and do? plenty of people on molokai would love to have these things here again, but the number 1 thing that keeps people from wanting to open one of these things up again is our small population size. everyone thinks 7,350 people is not enough potential customers to keep one of these venues afloat. is there some truth to that, or is that just people being too negative/doubtful? i'd love to hear some tips and suggestions.		/r/business/comments/crvcdh/i_want_to_open_an_entertainment_venue_in_my/	7	6	0	1.0	1566093821.0

my community needs an economic kick back into shape ; what could we do to help bring it back up?	i'm from the island of molokai, hawaii, population 7,350. i've lived here my whole life, and i'm a 17 year old high school senior. back in the island's heyday, there was a company here called molokai ranch . they used to run a cattle ranch, as well as a hotel, our only movie theater, a luxury campsite, a gas station, our only full-sized 18-hole golf course, and they were the largest employer on the island. when they were here plenty of people were working and everybody could put money in their pocket. as a result tons of businesses were up and running in town, and they could stay afloat because they had a lot more potential customers. more hotels, car rentals, and airlines were also available on molokai, which created competition in that area, and we had twice as many visitors annually. pretty much everyone worked for ranch in some way, and if you didn't, you ran or worked for a business whose customers and source of revenue were primarily ranch workers. then something happened; the ranch was going to build 200 million-dollar lot houses in undeveloped laau point, and that's where we drew the line. molokai people do not want our island to end up overdeveloped with plenty of tourists like oahu or maui, so we fought against this plan tooth and nail . so as a result, on april 5, 2008 , molokai ranch decided shut down all their operations, and pulled out from the island on may 22, 2008 as payback, leaving a huge chunk of our population out of work. about 1/3 of our population had to move away that summer because they couldn't make it and support their families over here anymore; i lost a lot of friends that way. over the next few years, lots of businesses on molokai went belly up due to not having enough customers and revenue to stay afloat anymore. surviving businesses raised prices due to less competition, and we lost our only movie theater and only chain restaurant . people are still struggling to find work on the island to this day, and the slogan all molokai businesses must use is we accept ebt . also, our annual visitor count went down to 50,000 as a result of having less options on amenities and activities. i want to help start something that will bring molokai's economy back to how it was in the ranch days. so we can have plenty of people working and having money in their pocket, and a lot more businesses can be open , creating a better market for the island.		/r/business/comments/crz42i/my_community_needs_an_economic_kick_back_into/	5	1	0	0.6	1566120085.0

how to make sense of sales data prior to making a sales forecast? 	i have to make sales forecast from an excel dataset provided to me. now i have learnt through various forecasting techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing , slr/mlr and arima. but now when i have to construct the forecast i am not exactly sure how to make heads and tails with this data. the variables have are quantity amd avg cost discount rates sale per unit price sale price i.e. price when sold retail price discount% profit margin% there are other variables like customer id, product number, wip number and inventory number which clearly do not factor in . except for sold on date which is required for constructing the time series. now the problem is i don't know how to get the time series started , do i plot the time series after summing the sale price values for each month and then plot the series ? if so, do i ignore the factors like quantity , avg cost, sale per unit price etc. ? 	vigbig	/r/business/comments/cuta78/how_to_make_sense_of_sales_data_prior_to_making_a/	2	1	0	1.0	1566652696.0

what am i getting myself into?	so i just came from a meeting with family members where they proposed bringing me into their attempt at manufactured spending. i say attempt because i'm new to all this so i wouldn't know for sure either way but that's how they started the conversation. they went on to explain, they're going for some llc thing and need me to open 3 bank accounts and they would place their own money in each. each account would be for a business they purchase and they would use the money as investment. and after some months, they would give a percentage of what they earn from their investing to me. no risk involved, as they explained it. they needed my credit score, picture of my id and ss, would need to do my taxes with their people, and of course open those bank accounts. so my question is, where am i liable here for? what's the worst/best case scenario for my situation if i went through with it? they don't want any of my money, just my info and the bank accounts. and yes, i do trust these family members. they just had a baby and it would seem off to me for two new parents to risk things within or around them with a 3 month old in tow. one is a sibling of mines. they already have a picture of my id but now i've been hit with hesitation concerning the rest, wondering what could result of me. not sure if this is the right place for this but i shoot my shots.	masterace01	/r/business/comments/cvg57b/what_am_i_getting_myself_into/	7	1	0	1.0	1566776521.0

could really use some advice on this screw-up	i started a small b2b business last year , and i'm a one-man show right now. &; it's only me, and i'm on active duty in the military. i've been worried that businesses will be concerned about those two things - who wants to trust their business to a single developer who has a full-time job - so i've been vague about these two aspects. &; i'm looking to advertise in an industry magazine, and spoke on the phone today with the editor. we chatted for a bit, and while i told him that it's just me at the moment, i'm afraid it came across that i'm no longer in the military and i did nothing to dissuade that line of reasoning. &; now the editor wants to chat again tomorrow for an interview to write an article on the business. i didn't outright lie about anything, but i recognize that i left the wrong impression about my additional employment outside of this business, and it's something that may well come up in the article and something pretty easy to figure out on, say, linkedin. &; how should i approach this? i feel like by omitting the information, i've been disingenuous, and i while i don't want an article to outright say that i'm in the military while running this business, i don't want to do any more harm by keeping this from the editor. i just don't know how exactly to broach this. any advice or ass-chewing is welcome.	micasaaz	/r/business/comments/cxbbm1/could_really_use_some_advice_on_this_screwup/	2	1	0	1.0	1567135019.0

what is the best software for tracking time, projects and invoices?	i'm a freelance musician/producer and have a business in transcribing and creating sheet music for musicians and other clients. currently i'm using a program called officetime to track hours and how much to charge based on hours worked. the downside is the invoice feature and other exporting functions are not really great and have too many steps to billing someone. i've been looking into quickbooks but i don't need all the other features they offer like logging miles and what not. i'm the only one in my business and don't hire anyone else, but it seems like a struggle when i get busy to bill and track and have a system set up for that. anyone have any advice or suggestions as to what to do?		/r/business/comments/d88fws/what_is_the_best_software_for_tracking_time/	3	0	0	0.5	1569254174.0

what do you hope to get out of your business?	we often talk about exit planning in the abstract, as some far-off pipe dream that will never come to fruition. it takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to get a business up and running. but that's the easy part. consistently growing the business and finding the optimal moment to cash out can be decidedly more difficult. the truth is you wouldn't do it if you weren't passionate about the product / service, the tenets of entrepreneurship, and the elusive exit. that said, there is usually something more people want out of an exit than simply the satisfaction of having built a successful business. maybe your goal is to retire at age 30, or perhaps you have a family and want to be able to purchase a nice vacation home to spend time with your loved ones. whatever it is, it's important not to lose sight of that. it's very easy to get caught up in the day-to-day calamity and forget why you're doing it in the first place. you want to build a business to sell. growth helps business, but it also makes companies more desirable. be deliberate about the things you're doing to grow your company and get it ready for sale. that way, when you hit your benchmark or, worst case scenario, something unexpected happens and you must step away, all the pieces are in place. now back to the question what do you hope to get out of your business? what factors into your decision to exit and what are you doing right now to prepare?		/r/business/comments/dbc4nn/what_do_you_hope_to_get_out_of_your_business/	4	1	0	0.67	1569852710.0

young business owner looking to break away from business with friends - advice needed!	hi guys, going to try and keep this short and sweet but i'm aware there's a lot of back story. i'm currently at uni and i run a promotion company that puts on music events in night clubs. the idea started a little under a year ago with two close friends of mine. it was always primarily my idea/dream but i knew they wanted to get involved to so i thought hell why not. we threw our first event with no idea of what would happen. to hire the venue, it cost 100 . me and my two friends each paid a third. all the costs on top of the event were paid by myself and then i reimbursed myself after the event. the event went amazing and sold out. having had such a success, we obviously decided we should do it again. i sourced another bigger venue, went and met the owner, made many discussions and agreed a deal that would cost us a lot less than usual. i organised the entire event by myself, much like the first one, and it sold out again. as great as everything has been going, this second event made me realise how much effort and time i put into it and how the other two do nothing. on the night, the one friend helps do ticket scanning and helps with random jobs but 95% of the work on the night and 100% of the planning is done by me. it's incredibly time consuming and draining to organise it all but i love it! that being said, i don't think it's fair that i'm putting in all my own time and effort and fronting the money. we've thrown 3 successful events now and i'm ready to really step up to the next level. the next event i'm throwing is in a venue with 5 x the capacity of our previous venue. i am spending thousands on booking international artists and am putting all my life's earnings on the line. i have confidence the event will go well but fingers crossed and all. anyways, i've realised that it's not fair on myself if they get to, in effect, own 1/3 of the business and, technically, the earnings as well. i've spoken to my one friend about this and he's said he's more than happy to step down and that it was only ever fun for him. he realises i do all the work and put the money in. however, my other friend doesn't seem so keen on the idea. it sounds bad but i think he knows there's a chance this will go big and wants to own his part in it. i had two lengthy discussions with him and ended up positioning 'if you're happy to put in half the money alongside me for the next event, i'm happy to own the business with you' but he said he doesn't have the money and he feels it's unfair that i want to take full ownership. i hope i'm not being stupid but with me doing all the organisation and putting in all the money, surely it's only fair that i own the business? the reason i come to reddit is because i need the advice from you beautiful people around how to legally go about taking full ownership of this business. to give some context, the business isn't registered - nor is there anything written to say who owns what. it's all verbal. i have explained that i'm happy to split the earnings from the past 3 events three ways and then carry on running the business myself, putting in large amounts of my own money. my one friend is more than fine with this but the other still seems fishy. that being said, i reckon he will go along. do i actually need to do anything to have proof i 'own' this business or am i being paranoid? i just don't want something to arise in the future where it means my one friend may be able to legally argue that he has a right to some of the earnings or ownership of the business. i have thought about writing up a tiny little contract stating that once the money is paid to both of them, they accept i take full ownership of the business. is this worth doing and how would i go about it? if not, am i just stressing for no reason? incase it helps, i am uk based. many thanks in advance.		/r/business/comments/dcjuzq/young_business_owner_looking_to_break_away_from/	4	1	0	1.0	1570065412.0

if employees can be fired without notice and for no reason, why should they be required to give two week's notice?	not sure if this is the correct subreddit, but here we go. this concept has always seemed absurd to me. in order to have a good reference, you have to give at least two-weeks notice, when an employer can fire you without notice without repercussion. i've been fired from a job once in the past. quit another without notice because i hated it that much, and all the others i've given 2-4 weeks notice. one took me off the schedule a week after i put in my two weeks. this was a place where in the year i worked there i was not late a single time, always did my job, never went on my phone while at work, constantly received praise from customers and good reviews, etc. it wasn't a big deal as i quit because my online business started to take off, but still, it was a little bit annoying. there are definitely circumstances where it's reasonable to fire someone or for someone to quit a job on the spot. but generally speaking, like in the case of the job that took me off one week after, it's always a one-way street in favor of the employer. which is super shitty. now, not all employers are bad about this, but i'd say 3 out of 4 certainly are. i'm also not so sure if it varies from industry to industry as my experience was in the service industry. in the service industry, managers, most of the time are pretty bad. it make sense that restaurant managers are usually terrible because most of the time they are promoted from being a server or bartender, aren't college educated, and are usually severely underpaid and basically just do whatever corporate tells them to do. of course, in the industry, by word of mouth most employees know where the best spots to work at are as far as how employees are treated and how much they are paid after they've been around for a while. the restaurants that do treat employees well and where they are also paid well then have their pick of all the best applicants. so, competition sort of balances it out a bit it seems in my experience. i watched a youtube video where an employer talks about the idea of employers being required to pay wages for two weeks if employees are fired with no good reason if employees are required to give two weeks notice. interesting idea to me. of course, there is unemployment, but i really have no idea how all of that works or what the rules are as i've never attempted to apply for it in the past. what are your thoughts?

how can i say no to a face to face meeting?	i work remotely in b2b sales and about 97% of the things that a customer needs can be handled either over the phone or by computer. occasionally i will have customers who are in their 80s and 90s and need a new phone and don't have the slightest clue of how to transfer anything, so i will drive the hour and a half to 2 hours to help them. my company does not cover my gas mileage, but i go because the sale makes me commission. &; i have a customer who has a pretty small account and has been getting smaller of the course of the year and they emailed me because they wanted to 'meet with someone face to face' to discuss their plan. discussing a plan is something that i can do via video conference, share my screen with them so they can look right along with me no problem. without the any potential sale, i really don't see the need for me to drive 2 hours to simply discuss the plan. i enjoy going above and beyond and i pride myself in responding to every email i get within the first 10-15 minutes. how can i tell the customer that it would be more efficient for perhaps both of us if we did this over the phone and via video instead of me driving out 2 hours there and 2 hours back to simply go over the plan. &; any advice in general on how to either tell your customer no, or maybe guide them to an alternative towards what they initially wanted without offending or losing them would be helpful. thanks!	verysmallbeta	/r/business/comments/djnro2/how_can_i_say_no_to_a_face_to_face_meeting/	4	6	0	0.76	1571406533.0

what is the evidence that diversity of race benefits businesses?	i've heard the claim that diversity helps the bottom line substantially. i can totally appreciate that allowing all people, regardless of race, to work at your company makes sense since you are expanding the pool of talented people that you can hire. treating all people as equals makes sense, but, for example. lets say that, for whatever reason, your company just happened to be like 98% asian since more asian people applied for job listings. in other words, there was no discrimination against people of other races, but it just so happened that you only got asian applicants for the most part. what is the evidence that a company which has a more even distribution of races would have any advantage compared to the mostly asian company? isn't it likely that the mostly asian company would tend to do better because asian have a higher average iq compared to other races? is there any evidence that actively hiring for people of a an under-represented race, to increase diversity ratios, would provide any advantage? to me what makes sense is for companies to not worry about their race percentages, but rather to make sure all people regardless of gender, race, and sexuality have a fair interview process. why do companies seem to be pushing this narrative that they need to make race ratios more even?		/r/business/comments/dkuszp/what_is_the_evidence_that_diversity_of_race/	9	1	0	0.67	1571629735.0
how to do pricing for quantity based discounts?	i hope i can get the business community to help me on this. i understand that this is a very beginner level type question but i don't know where to start. some background my father owns a packaging business, and has done so for 38+ years. he's been in charge of the prices and the company has been doing well, but at 72 he seems to have made a few errors recently. i've recently joined his firm as manager, and up until today he was in charge of pricing, but i've decided to take this on myself now. we sell empty bags and boxes to shops. we're unique in the trade in that we will sell you individual items, whereas our competitors demand you buy a full box / crate / pallet load at a time. so, we charge a price for these individual items based on their cost price, and if the customer buys more, then depending on the product, they get a discount depending on how many they buy. we have one product where they can buy it individually, but if they buy 100 then they get a 15% discount. if they buy a full box of 600 then they get a 33% discount. more if they 3 or more full boxes, 50% off the single unit price. the problem is, my dad has not been very careful. there is one particular product that costs 46 pence each, but if you order 25 the price goes down to 39p each , 100 and more is 31p each and 600 or more is 23p each . the problem is when you order 450 of these, for example. this would cost you 139.50. however, if you were to add 600 to your cart then the cost to the customer is less, at 138! which is ludicrous. we have many products where this happens. i'd like to know if there is a single formula or method that can be applied to prevent this kind of mistake from happening? or perhaps, it's as simple as a percentage level we shouldn't go over? i really don't know. math is absolutely not my strong point. any pointers, methods, or advice is obviously really appreciated, we desperately need some help in figuring this out. it simply cannot be right that when you order more of an item, it becomes cheaper. the unit price can go down, of course, but not like this. the above product is priced like this quantity / bulk purchase pricing 25 - 99 / 0.39 each 100 - 599 / 0.31 each 600 - 1199 / 0.23 each 1200 or more /0.18 each	CloggyDutch	/r/business/comments/dkz5n9/how_to_do_pricing_for_quantity_based_discounts/	2	3	0	0.72	1571657419.0

what should i do about my facebook account?	hi all, i'm 23 and for the last 5-6 years of my professional life i've been a fairly self contained entity working in fields with very broad liberal ideals and policies on social media. so, my facebook is currently a cacophony of crude memes, socialist propaganda, and alot of communist iconography. the problem is now i'm a mortgage loan originator. working with adults of all walks of life looking to buy 1 to multiple homes and my online persona needs to be approachable and not calling for the seizure of the means of production. my question is, is it easier to just tell everyone on my friends list i'm making a new account than quarintine/delete the old account? or is there a way to salvage my current account and turn it into something business appropriate? edit the reason this is important is because a large part of being an mlo is marketing, specifically marketing yourself. so my social media presence has to be clean for that end.	zekthan32	/r/business/comments/dl55jp/what_should_i_do_about_my_facebook_account/	8	1	0	1.0	1571684444.0
advice needed getting returned invoices because of no p.o. number on them...	in recent years when invoicing a client i've been writing the invoice out exactly as they say, only to get an email 3 weeks to a month later saying like sorry can you please submit your invoice again with this po number listed at the top? thi po number is always something they don't give me prior to this exchange. this has happened from a handful of different companies and i'm wondering if this is a tactic used by companies to delay payment or if it's a product of companies moving over to different payment systems in the middle of working on my payment. it has just become a pattern with a number of my clients so i'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with this or has any insight. thanks!

why im starting my own business	i won't go into details on what line of work i'm in. i will say i work for a family member who has always had a tumultuous relationship with the rest of the family, due to a general selfishness and resentment this family member carries. however, he offered me a position in his business, presenting me an opportunity to take over once he retires. i figure, might as well give it a shot. after 3 and a half months, i have realized two things - 1, i really like this line of work, and 2, i cant continue working for this person. he is not strategic in business, i have no confidence in this company even surviving with him at the helm. not only that, he is extremely inappropriate and unprofessional as an employer and a human being. some highlights first problem money. 1. i am not on payroll yet, and get paid in cash, late by 3-4 days consistently 2. since i am being paid cash, and i am not on payroll, he has requested that i do not deposit my money in the bank. how am i supposed to pay bills? i ask. he says, go to the bank when you need to pay. or, launder your money through your parents! 3. the company has slowly been losing money since i've arrived. the other day, he tells us hes dipping into his retirement to pay rent. he also tells us that a more senior employee is taking one for the team by taking a month off of working - looks at me and says, you know, shes been working here longer than you, but i couldn't ask you cause i know you wouldn't do it for us - yes, you're right, i wouldn't! second problem unprofessional, inappropriate - as a businessman, as a human being. 1. in meetings with potential clients, he has mentioned which products we have better margins on, what we make more money with. 2. he had no sense of direction for the company when i came in. no procedures in place for operations, no positioning of our product line, no outstanding differentiating factors about us as a business identified. after listening to his ideals, his desire for this business, i created a business plan, marketing plan, and operations plan. all he said in response is you use some big words in these reports and that's great, you do things this way, i'll keep doing things my way. the latter, he continued to say after our suppliers called him the most frustrating and disorganized client they've ever dealt with, due to the way he conducts operations. 2. he has asked me to run his errands most notably, asked me to call his dentist and cancel his appointment cause he didn't feel like calling 3. when i needed to leave for the afternoon for a funeral, says you know, your generation really gets it easy when it comes to work, getting all this time off 4. tells me i need to make the company lots of money so he can retire and go move down to the caribbean and fuck young hookers 5. burps, farts out loud in the office - its an open space/open concept. for me, this was the final straw yesterday. to start off, i'm white, but i have a little bit of congolese from my moms side. the other day, my boss turned to me and said so, how does it feel being part negroid? you know, i kind of look at you differently knowing that you can imagine why i am leaving. i'm building a business plan , and working on building supply chain. once i have a legitimate business ready to operate, i'm walking out the door - and i'll be taking my accounts with me. i really like this industry and line of work. this company right now is not legitimate. the boss will not even accept any form of planning, procedures or standards for any facet of the business. why would i stick around? i have created all the tools necessary to build a framework for a business. the timing is right as well, from a. standpoint on where my clients are at, and where our market is at. so i'm going to take them with me and do it myself. edit forgot to mention the final straw was when he said he might need me to take a month off in december. or, alternatively, wait to be paid for december and january at the end of january. this happened the same day as the negroid comment.	doorhandle235	/r/business/comments/dllnnj/why_im_starting_my_own_business/	9	7	0	0.75	1571767088.0

advice on selling on ebay and amazon	hi, we are a packaging wholesaler. we buy packaging from big companies and our niche is that we will then split that package and allow our customers to buy very small quantities, whereas otherwise they would have to buy massive amounts from our suppliers. i want to take advantage of selling on amazon and ebay, but i don't have the time. i don't want to hire a new member of staff either. i'm based in the uk, and the two things i have been thinking about is 1 asking someone to sell whatever they want from our website on amazon and ebay, at whatever markup they wish and they keep the profits on top. 2 asking someone to sell on these platforms in exchange for commission 3 finding an agency or other professional to outsource this to. can anyone suggest anything i have not thought of, perhaps? or things i should consider? or if these are crap ideas?

what if i paid full for any phone of youre choice?	so im thinking one day, what if i started a company that basically pays full prices for any phone of youre choice in exchange for you watching two 30 second ads followed with 5 quick questions for one calendar year. would you accept the offer? the fine print you dont actually own the phone until after the year. the company either buys the phone or has an agreement with the carriers. failure to complete the agreement results in you either returning the phone back and paying a $50 restocking fee plus any damages, or you pay for it outright, maybe you get a discount say 30% off. after a year the phone is yours. you still have to buy and pay for a phone plan with a carrier to have service. the ads are tailored based on your online behavior and interests. this works better if the company doing this is say google or facebook. the ad either starts when you power on your phone, try to unlock it, or you can open the app to complete it proactively. the ad is most likely a video ad, with an option to skip/end after 30 seconds, similar to youtube. after the ad, youll be asked very quick questions about it. 1 - name of the company/product 2 - company/product description/category 3 - did you like the video/product 4 - would you buy/recommend to your friends 5 - was this relevant to you? if you are interested in the content presented in the ad, you can click it to learn more or buy xyz. revenue the revenue model is pretty straight forward. we have a total 730 ads in only one year. we must cover the price of the phone and make money. the idea is to charge advertisers a huge premium since were guaranteeing youre attention and feedback. for example $20 cpc , $10 cpm , with a 2% royalty on anything the user purchases. the revenue could be hard but i think its doable. many phones cost about $1,000. you only need a handful of clicks to breakeven. the gross revenue target should be $3,000 per device. partnerships. because we would theoretically become the reason people upgrade their phones, this should give us enough bargaining power with phone makers and carriers to give us discounts. so the iphone x at retail may cost $1,300 but we would only pay $900 for it. with apple transition into services and subscriptions, i could see them discounting the phone to us while maintaining high prices. carriers would be incentives to offer us discounts because it gives them greater opportunities to sell you accessories and phone plans such as unlimited, headphones, insurance, etc. maybe phone carriers such as t-mobile kick back $2 from whatever youre paying for your phone plan for a year or 5% whatever you buy while upgrading phones. what do you all think? could this actually work? its really expensive, i know.

i accepted two job offers. one i'm currently employed at and the one i really want. what do i do now?	hi, so for starters i am a college student who is graduating next semester. i interned with company a this past summer. i liked my internship, and wanted to continue it into the school year but the only way i had seen prior interns do this was if they accepted a full time offer at the end of the summer. i wanted to apply later in the fall, but felt pressured to apply during the summer to maintain the internship. so i applied for a full time position, received an offer, and accepted it. i did not sign any binding contract for that position. i am not really sure if the job i do at company a is what i want to do after graduation, i like it for now just maybe not forever. so i applied to other places and got another offer from company b with similar pay doing something i think is more interesting. i accepted the offer from company b and plan to follow through. it has now been ~2 month since i accepted my offer at company a. i still work there, and i need to keep my job there until at least april because i have bills i need to pay. i am afraid that if i retract my acceptance from company a they will fire me . how do i handle this situation in a way that i can keep my job until april without burning bridges?	itontoyo	/r/business/comments/dv5ds9/i_accepted_two_job_offers_one_im_currently/	2	5	0	1.0	1573535912.0

advice for business	hello everyone i have an idea of starting my own clothing business in the country i live, because i notice the lack and need of some type of clothing and i see this as an opportunity. at the beginning i plan to order some stuff online from other countries and have it with me to be able to deliver instantly or up to 2 days i'm not interested in dropshipping model, because i think 80% orders would be from this city as my clothes will be quite specific. and i want to be able to deliver it up to 2-3 days. i have about 2000$ to begin with and i can comfortably risk them, without being too worried about loosing it. so the main questions are should i create an eshop? instagram is very popular platform here and my main idea is to promote everything on instagram, do sponsored posts and etc. could 2000$ be enough? or should i save some more?

question from someone who has no idea what they're doing.	i apologize if this isn't the place to ask this, but for someone who never went to college and having no friends who've gone to school for business, i'm not sure where else to go. the long and the short of it is, i've got a good decade or so of service industry experience in pretty much every position possible. recently some acquaintances of mine came to me with an idea for a restaurant/cafe and while i don't want to get into details about that, i feel its a pretty solid idea if we play our cards right. problem is, they've got the money and i've got the know how but i feel like its the perfect time for me to at least get some form of degree in business, so i can round out my knowledge and know i'm going in with as much knowledge as possible. along with the fact that a business degree never hurt anyone. problem is, i've been shopping around local universities and online courses, but i have absolutely no idea what kind of classes to take. every list of programs i've seen is like reading a foreign language. does anyone have suggestions on where to start?

what to do if you don't have a technical cofounder	see full post with images introduction one of the most common issues that entrepreneurs run into, that no one seems to like to talk about, is the lack of a technical cofounder. in the startup world, it is almost a bit of a taboo to mention that you dont have anyone that can actually build out your idea. telling someone this will often elicit from them an exasperated but sympathetic oh accompanied by a glazing over of their eyes as they lose interest. my goal here is to relieve the pain, confusion, and desperation that i so often see this issue causing entrepreneurs. what do you do when you have a great idea and are ready to execute but there is no one on the team who can actually build the product? you have four options. yes that is right, the decision can actually be distilled into four different options one of which, depending on your unique situation, will stand out as a much better choice than the others. the path you choose has far reaching consequences for the future of your company so dont make this decision lightly. at various companies and times in my life i have experience with every single one of these options and have seen the resounding successes and devastating catastrophes that can result from each, many times over. finding a technical cofounder this option is both the best option and the most unrealistic. finding a technical cofounder is like entering into a marriage, it is an important decision and one which a lot of the time does not work out. if you rush into a cofounder relationship out of desperation there is a high likelihood that it will not end well. on the list of why startups fail not the right team is the number 3 reason at 23% usually commands a six-figure salary. most startups that dont have a product yet just cannot afford this. furthermore, without a product and traction, it is very difficult to impossible to raise enough money to cover a six figure salary. you are in a bit of a chicken and egg situation with this option where you need the money to build the product and you need the product to raise the money. hiring an overseas developer the other sub-option is to hire an overseas developer to build the mvp. this option can be affordable for most startups the final decision so final decision tree goes like this can you afford a significant amount of time looking for a technical cofounder and abide by the possibility of not finding one or one not working out? then try to find a technical cofounder. otherwise, can you afford to pay out a six-figure developer salary? then hire a local developer after a rigorous filtering process but keep in mind that most of the time you will be better served by learning to code it yourself. otherwise, do you have the technical knowledge/native bilingual proficiency to manage overseas developers? then possibly hire overseas developers but keep in mind that most of the time you will be better served by learning to code it yourself. finally, if you didnt fulfill any of the conditions of the routes above, learn to code it yourself. conclusion a lot of people will tell you that learning to code will take years and is a waste of time. i was told something similar by a lot of very talented technical people at well-known companies. there is a lot of a gatekeeping attitude around coding unfortunately. for someone who is intelligent and committed this is just not true. learning to code is one of the most useful and rewarding things you can learn as a software-focused entrepreneur that will bear fruits for the rest of your career. note i offer this opinion free of commercially influenced bias. i am not selling nor am associated with any product that teaches people to learn to code.

what should i charge for mentoring/coaching?	i own a successful wholesaling real estate business. we do low 6 figures a month. 1 years ago i started mentoring my best friend of 10+ years. i kind of talked him into getting started in the biz, he trusted me, worked really hard reading watching all the material i gave him. and his first year 2019 he will gross really close to 500k, with a net profit of ~400k. i gave him the 5-10k it took to get started and im return i got 25% of the net profit for the first year and 10% gross every year after year 1. its been great for both of us. since i started working with him in late 2018, ive had a couple other friends slowly get started in the biz. one friend from middle school spent a week 1v1 with me last month and will net 46.8k on his first deal. i have one other friend who has started part time and in the last few months has profited ~20k. with everyone ive worked with so far have all been close friends so i havent taking a fee upfront. everything is on the backend depending on their success. my question is, ive had a few people reach out to me for training that im not as close with. what would be a fair price to ask for 1v1 mentoring for a year? that would also come with my full blueprint of my business. all my data connections, my developers, literally everything. and maybe 3-5hrs a week of 1v1 coaching calls. with my friends ive risked my time, but i knew these guys wouldnt quit, i know they would do what it takes. with the people i dont know as well, i dont want to do the same equity deal incase they dont see success in the first 30 days and quit and i just wasted my time. i share almost nothing about work on social media, im not looking to be a guru. but im getting to the point i can take a step back from the day to day and will have more time to do mentoring if i please. with that said id maybe take on another 3-5 students max. what would be a fair price to charge for a blueprint and 1v1 training for a business that would can be doing mid 6 figures your first year and possibly 7 figures within a couple years. excuse all the grammar/spelling errors im a college drop out with dyslexia.

exit strategy advice seeking 	my family has been running an average-sized private hotel in a tourist city for like more than 15 years. tourism was booming in my place around 2005-2015 or so, the hotel's performance doing so well at the time. however, recently, too many of small hotels are built everywhere, according to my country system, doing business is quite easy, the city is small, taxi cost is cheap or everywhere is reachable with scooters so good location hotel like ours doesn't really matter when people consider one to stay. people open hotels, hostels literally everywhere with really low price, now we have the rise of airbnb which makes it much worse. due to the scale, it's hard for us to cut cost and compete with the others. along with the country's economy slump, trade-war and other tensions, the hotel's performance going down so bad recently. we currently having quite high debt from different to swap to pay off interest monthly and those debts been building up bigger and bigger. so, i'm looking for some advice for him to exit this business, he got another estate for rent with pretty good passive income now but it's not enough for the entire hotel's interest. it's a limited company but due to some specific way we do business here, we have borrowed much more than we could. we living in a big estate now too, but selling it should be the very very last choice as it's considered as going bankrupt, we've been here for more than 10 years. the performance is so bad so no one really wants to buy the stake, and the land belongs to council, we can't sell it. the economy been slumping recently, too many worry about the upcoming regression with all the tensions happening around, when a regression happens, estate value as a collateral is dumped hence debts goes to bad debts and bank will do what they do. anyone has some ideal for this case? i'm not sure if this is appropriate subreddit to post this but please let me know if there is some where else better to post this! thanks!	clirous	/r/business/comments/ekcbcj/exit_strategy_advice_seeking_hoteltourism/	4	2	0	0.75	1578226624.0

why is it impossible to find a decent point of sale pos system with a wms for my retail store? what do you use and why?	naturally, like me, youre probably using shopify pos, clover, square, or any of those top 10 best pos systems for your business systems. but these unfortunately are very limiting, and restricting, and arent beneficial to a retail store that moves a lot of merchandise. what im looking for is something that could sync with a solid wms / ims , , which would allow me to track multi-store inventory, as well as track track bin locations for my multi-store locations, all for 1 sku. i would need a system that can track multiple skus for 1 sku. for example, my own made up sku + product sku in 2 separate text boxes for 1 item. the system would need a solid barcode labeling system as well, with many label shapes and sizes available and full label print option customization. and lastly, a great integration system, to sync with my shopify website, quick books, ship station, and of course the wms/ims. but for all this to help me, i need a solid pos system for front end retail sales. i need to be able to pull all of this information up quickly, barcode scan, customize multiple receipt options, such as gift receipts, etc. and have a gift card system as well. i dont know why, with months of looking at everything i can online, the only conclusion i can gather is that this type of system doesnt exist. if you can possibly direct me to something that falls somewhere in line with what im looking for, or maybe assist me in letting me know what other medium sized businesses use, and how they created/got such a system, im pretty desperate and would greatly appreciate your help. thank you so much!

when starting a business and applying for a business loan, can you include your personal salary income as business revenue?	let's say a person starts an llc with a partner, but it isn't registered as a partnership. when filing for an ein, the irs determines it as a partnership until certain forms are filled out disputing that fact. the total business income/revenue is $0, but they put $5,000 into it initially. they continue to work separately for private companies with annual salary of $100k. since it is a startup, they haven't sold anything yet and have made $0 with the company. when applying for a business loan, can they include that salary as a business revenue? do they put that the business revenue is $0? is it too early to apply for a business loan? if so, when is the best time to apply for one?

how do i tactfully stop a nearby competitor, our aunt, from visiting our store and copying us?	my parents run a fashion store that sells clothes imported from japan. li, my copycat aunt, opened a similar store in a different mall 400 meters away! she didn't tell my parents until her grand opening as a surprise ! li's riling my parents, but they don't want offend or end relationship with her. how can they stop her competitive intelligence? li and her 16 y.o. daughter, eva, pretend to pass by my parents' store twice a week on their way to the restaurant or supermarket . but her motive is to copy whatever my parents do, like dressing her window-display mannequins the same way, and importing the same clothes from japan. my parents see eva using the phone they know she's taking pictures and videos of their mannequins and clothes.	erasthai	/r/business/comments/elwsh5/how_do_i_tactfully_stop_a_nearby_competitor_our/	6	8	0	1.0	1578508726.0
 how do i deliver a formal corrective measure to my severely depressed employee? im left with no options.	im a new manager at a fortune 500 company. i have an employee who is really a great guy with great potential, but simply will not do his job properly. he cuts corners, leaves work early before his work is really done, and generally does sloppy work. over the past few months, i have gone out of my way to help him do his work properly, clean up after him, and work with him to show him the best practices and the fundamentals of his job . i started the process of giving him a formal corrective measure because his work is just not improving despite me coaching him and training him on why its important to do things the right way. today, i found out from a coworker, that this employee took a leave of absence before i started working here due to being in a mental hospital for a long time due to severe depression and what i presume to be a suicide attempt. naturally, this makes me hesitant to driver this corrective measure, because i understand that he may be unmotivated at work due to his own mental health issues. that being said, if he cant perform the basic fundamentals of this job, its not fair to our clients who pay us for this job. i need to tread carefully here, and im relatively new to this role, and obviously dont fully understand his personal life. what advice can you give to someone who needs to break this hard news. this corrective measure puts him on track to being fired within the coming months if he does not improve. thank you	apiculum	/r/business/comments/em14wf/new_manager_how_do_i_deliver_a_formal_corrective/	4	1	0	1.0	1578527273.0

trying to figure out how to legally hire my spouse as an employee?	background i own an llc as a sole proprietor. i am a psychologist, she is a therapist. while i am already licensed in south carolina, she is still working on her sc license, so she can't yet see patients in the sc office . according to the irs website, i am what is considered to be a disregarded entity. however, that also means that i can't hire anyone else or i have to change my designation? at least that's what it looks like. how can i hire my spouse as an employee in order to qualify for group health benefits while she is still working on her license in sc. at this point in time, my spouse will not be taking in any income, however it will be through the business. is there anyway to have her as a 0 income employee, qualifying the llc for group health benefits, and not break any tax, federal, or state laws? what would be her tax obligation and what would be mine? thanks guys!	wontwasteme	/r/business/comments/ent2fg/trying_to_figure_out_how_to_legally_hire_my/	3	3	0	0.81	1578861609.0

looking for opinions employers, why would you hesitate to hire a veteran?	 background i'm a small business owner. pending a new contract that i'm working on i'll be creating a new sub-business and hiring my first worker. recently relocated to nevada and going through the tedious steps to get set up. one thing i noticed is the patriot employer program which is basically a tax-incentivized program for employers of veterans. while that's good it got me thinking. why would such a program be needed? veterans, by and large are trained to be prompt, follow orders, and keep the boots shiny/be clean shaven . it's engrained into who they were. on paper, they should be the perfect workers. obviously things like ptsd and other ailments are things to watch out for, but in general, every vet i've met has been upper echelon. so i'd like to understand. what reasons would make an employer not want to hire a vet .	mrstackz	/r/business/comments/eoqrnu/looking_for_opinions_employers_why_would_you/	14	8	0	0.76	1579033064.0

what to do to deal with so called entrepreneurs with no ethics and value.	1. most of the startup entrepreneurs lie and they try to trick to get the services in a low amount by false promising a better project next time.. why do they do it? and the other problem is that they dont know what they want and then we explain them everything, provide them complete insight how, why, benefits etc, they take second, third, fourth....keep taking suggestions from infinite people and the end they get confused and some even feel like being cheated when they find that the same service someone else is providing in 50% less $ ... if they can't understand and value and can differentiate the difference between quality and cheap/spammy services how they are going to be successful? i am facing two issues i am providing digital services to startups and mid-sized company. now i don't provide services to such entrepreneurs or startups...but i know this is not the best thing to do.. now some of you might say that you should know how to convince but that isn't true.. 2. mid-sized companies are having such a bad work environment, they forgets to follow up or respond to emails... really? and the most common excuse from their team we receive is we were really busy with xyz project , we were having this and that ... why there is no rules and standards of becoming an entrepreneur? why anyone from anywhere of any age without any discipline or professionalism even call them entrepreneurs? why can't there be some sort of standards..? why shouldn't an entrepreneur or startup should be certified? ps i am not saying all the entrepreneurs and startups are like this... but there are still a lot of so called entrepreneurs with zero sense of discipline.	tech1210	/r/business/comments/eqk2rr/what_to_do_to_deal_with_so_called_entrepreneurs/	2	4	0	0.83	1579371696.0

why does an e-commerce that only sells to brazillians and has its only office in brazil has its address in the us?	there's an e-commerce called produtosmax that works with dropshipping in brazil, selling chinese products to brazillian for a higher price without a stock in the country . one curious thing i noticed is that their adress for contact is 690 s highway, jackson wy 83001 , an american address that, when looking with google maps, only shows a bank at the location. what is the purpose of that, knowing that their offices and workforce are all in brazil, and is there a service to buy addresses in the us or something similar? i'd guess they do this to dodge brazillian laws, but i'd like to understand more why and how they did it.

i need help to start a fictional business... in d&d.	long story short in a non-industrial fantasy world, my character needed a way to keep body parts fresh in transportation for his many rituals. so he went off to hunt a monster that lives by consuming heat. he then found a smith who built a metal box to contain that creature. anything put in that box will be kept cold... he made a fridge. &; now, he wants to make a business out of this new-age idea. but i have no idea how to make that work exactly. i want him to have full rights to the fridge, so no one can just claim they made it or can make an alternative version based off his designs. i also want him to make a lot of profit from it while also letting it be accessible to the poor and the commoners. the idea is that this will spark an industrial age in his world. i also hope to inspire my party members to invent new shit too. &; details worth noting making a chest-sized fridge requires 600lbs of copper and 6lbs of cast iron. that's 300 gold pieces worth of copper, and 6 silver pieces worth of iron. that's the total price of building the fridge, and it'd take a total of 35 days to build it. that's all if a single person builds it without assistance. but with a business, i'd assume there would be a lot of people building them to increase work flow. the creature that absorbs heat also expands when in contact with it. this means farming it should be relatively easy . probably will need dedicated farmers for this though, to avoid the creature expanding uncontrollably due to untrained hands. &; i already have a contact in mind to start the business, she's a pretty skillfull engineer. but i'd like to sell the license or whatever it'd be called, to mass produce and sell the fridge while making sure they can't keep the designs to make their own versions or whatever . then depending on how well that goes, probably sell that license to multiple companies to make sure the technology is more accessible and more likely to spark a new age. the main issue is the percentages. how do i split the percentages with the contract? i'd like to split it between the companies owning the licences, the original engineer who helped build the first fridge and then obviously my character who came up with the whole idea. &; &; feel free to ask any questions, i'll answer them as i can.

this is my first real job out of college and im almost positive that i dont want it to be my career.	i work as an analyst at a bank. graduated last year with accounting and statistics. i enjoyed both majors, but this job doesnt really require either of those skills. its a lot of data entry. a good bit of problem solving too, which helps the day go by. honestly its a great job that anyone would be proud to have, but i know ill get tired eventually, so im trying to plan my exit. my biggest priority is living somewhere that it snows, and with mountains relatively close by. currently living in the south. i want to move to colorado or pennsylvania. i think where i live os more important to me than what i do. so regardless, that is going to be my first hurdle. second, i want to work around cars. driving is my favorite thing to do. i want to have a job where the context of the work is centered around cars/transportation. i dont want to be locked in at the office all day long, and i want there to be travel required on occasion. looking for $50-60k/yr, so i know that i need to build my resume up a good bit. im working on some online certifications. this probably sounds like venting but if anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated. i love to work, and looking for something less political. in my current role, everyone is stepping on everyone elses toes. not my style. im about honesty and integrity. i need to make a change within the next 1-2 years and i want to get it right.	driveanywhere	/r/business/comments/eu7ryr/this_is_my_first_real_job_out_of_college_and_im/	3	1	0	1.0	1580051277.0

how to do business like an experienced business owner?	i'd imagine that a long time business owner has traits of being patient, knows to be consistent and get things done on time, and to do it to a high standard. technical side they have standard procedures, due diligence, and a time tested way of doing things. being educated and going beyond business standards strategic side they may have a specific idea to be aggressive, calculated, and take on new opportunities yet keep the business consistent. governance side to make sure the entire business model is making the 'car fast, agile and reliable' executive/philosophy to compete with competitors by executing in a certain mindset. an entrepreneurial vision to optimally reach a goal. reflective/adaptive willing to adopt the best ideas/results from different sources. willing to change and sculpt the business or previous ideas to a new way high achieving ability to thrive to become an olympic level business. and to make the consistent good decisions under pressure to sum up, an experienced business owner has a clear picture in what needs to be done to reach a high level. which includes adopting novel ideas, and removing redundant ones. using the most modern ways of doing things. to execute and sustain their entrepreneurial vision, until that needs to be adjusted. do you think this is on the right track? what are your feelings about what mentality leads to strong experienced businessman? i appreciate any responses.		/r/business/comments/ew5qyc/how_to_do_business_like_an_experienced_business/	7	8	0	0.85	1580392373.0

hitting a wall when it comes to equity	i am the ceo and founder of a small team launching a new business. i've been at the company obviously the longest. this is the first company i've launched of this size and scale, but a private investor came in but required significant equity at 60%. i retained 20%. i have spilt the other 20% up among the other people who have helped start the company. there's a few problems. two of the people who have equity only put in a short amount of time and for one reason or another have stopped over a year ago. they represent 6%. we are trying to attract some new staff including a cfo. they of course want equity, but at the moment everything is assigned unless i dropped below 20% which i don't really feel is appropriate or best for me.

i have a bunch of ideas for specialized tools. how could i put these into ideas into production? 	the process seems to go i idea, ii blueprint idea, iii manufacture product, iv sell product. for certain, there is more involved-- pitching your idea , distribution, cost analysis, labor, etc... i'm curious how to blueprint idea and begin manufacturing it. i imagine a prototype would first be involved. even this prototype seems to baffle me let's take a silly example. let's say the idea is a double-headed ice cream scoop. i can look at the ice cream scoop, learn its mechanism, and conceptualize how to create a double-headed scoop. but i wouldn't know where to get the metal for the scoop, the small working pieces, the plastic handle, etc... it's just a idea that i could make if i had complete knowledge of all factories. i imagine there is a way to pitch an idea to a manufacturer. i am curious about this--- what i would have to do to effectively blueprint it, and how much money i could get off of it? a more profitable and ambitious project would be to make my own company. if i were so ambitious, what are some referential knowledge for manufacturing companies that would custom produce small working parts that i could assemble-- or manufacturing companies that would make the whole product with an effective blueprint? primarily, how would i effectively blueprint this?	band_in_DC	/r/business/comments/f1kulk/i_have_a_bunch_of_ideas_for_specialized_tools_how/	4	2	0	1.0	1581307839.0

who is my target audience?	i am trying to figure out what niche my website should mainly cater to. i have a couple of online businesses, but i am primarily a website developer/designer. most of my clientele is local, but i am wanting to switch up my income streams. so, i am planning on adding content marketing to my web development site. starting the blog on the site isn't the issue, figuring out what audience i am trying to appeal to is what is tripping me up. basically i have two options in my mind . either way, my audience is basically small businesses and entrepreneurs, as that is the majority of my client base. first off, i could write content about creating a successful business in general. this would be things like basic marketing tactics, the best onboarding systems, things like that. the ultimate purpose would be to drive more website service sales and possibly grow my business enough to hire other developers. the second option would be to write content to teach others about website building, maintenance, hosting, etc. to appeal to those who want to do it themselves. this would have a goal of creating and selling products and courses to go along with that. as my current business stands- which makes more sense? to write things relevant to my target audience that just so happens to also try to sell them my services? or to create products that would create more passive income, but essentially is competing with my own services?	abcde0123	/r/business/comments/fa011f/who_is_my_target_audience/	2	1	0	1.0	1582750321.0

a lifehack about how to get to know your employees and your top management	when i was ceo, i always had between 7 to 9 employees reporting directly to me. naturally, not all of them had the same relationships with me. with some it was easy for me while i felt some tension when communicating with others. they were all professionals, but professionalism does not guarantee personal compatibility. at the same time, i considered the understanding between me and top managers to be a crucial factor in the success of my company. and then i came up with a way to overcome the problem i started taking such employees with me on business trips. sometimes under a vain pretext. my goal was to spend a lot of time with them in a relaxed atmosphere in a plane, train or taxi. whether one likes it or not, people, when sitting in neighboring chairs, begin to communicate more. little by little, i used this opportunity not only to listen to them, but also to speak myself. i tried to explain my position to them on various issues. it's true that sometimes the result was different - after two or three trips, i realized that the top manager and i were incompatible, so we parted. not all relations can be brought to perfection, but it is definitely worth trying. how do you build a rapport with your employees and subordinates?	sbiryulin	/r/business/comments/fa8cqk/a_lifehack_about_how_to_get_to_know_your/	40	136	0	0.9	1582787554.0

advice for choosing european business school?	hello. i recently received a few offers from european business schools and was wondering what everyone's opinion is regarding those schools in general and what choice i should make. the offers i've received are 1. university college dublin smurfit business school msc in international management / cems 2. copenhagen business school msc in economics and brands & communications management 3. emst berlin masters in management i'm conflicted because i've heard of these schools before, but i'm not sure which one would be the best fit for the career of someone looking to go into management long term around the world, not just in that particular region. i've been very interested in pursuing a cems degree as it's quite highly prestigious among these schools and it's related to what i want, but i also heard that for cems the reputation of the school is important. and i'm just not sure how a school like ucd would stand out to the likes of cbs and hec. cbs would usually be my top choice, as they also allow students in the msc in economics students to apply to cems, but i hear that the competition is quite tough and am wondering whether it would be worth it to risk that. anyway i'm just looking for some third person feedback here, so any tips or advice are appreciated. thanks in advance!

how to tell my parents they arent a part of the business anymore??	my wife and i bought a small cafe last year and my parents decided to help us with our business. that shortly turned into arguments about whether or not they should be partners bc of all the work they have put into the business. my mother has helped in certain aspects. she had contacts in construction to ease the cost of improving the business. however, they are incredibly toxic, have arguments in front of customers, constantly disrespect myself and my wifes decisions for the business. all the while draining the savings that my wife and i have worked so hard to grow in order to help achieve our dreams. i dont know how to tell them to please stop being a part of this any more than i already have and they refuse to believe that what i am saying is true. i also dont want them to try and hit me with a law suit and claim that i havent paid them or anything. ive been paying their bills since the inception of this as well as giving them a weekly salary apart from it. i really dont know what to do anymore to get them out of my hair. tl;dr parents are toxic and are draining the business and i need help to get them out.	tommyijr	/r/business/comments/fjzin3/how_to_tell_my_parents_they_arent_a_part_of_the/	3	0	0	0.5	1584421410.0

what is my best option for online business management courses?	hi. i'm a 23 year old with a sporadic job history. i went to college for something science related, and dropped out after a year, and have been doing entry level jobs since. i don't plan to go back to college, but i have a sense that i need some type of business education in order to have any success in the future. i don't consider myself a business person. rather, i have worked with animals and food. i know that although i enjoy working under authority, i am very independent and eventually i see myself running my own business. i don't think i'll just start my own business right away but i do think that i need some courses to set the foundation to move forward in any way, either with a company or independently. i have some money to spare so i don't mind spending a little bit on online courses. but i want these courses to be legitimate. i think some type of certification would be nice, but not necessary for me as i feel i just need the skills. i just don't know what website is my best source for courses. i don't want to accidentally commit to classes that do nothing for me, especially if they are paid. i need a very strong sense of structure and purpose in these classes. if they're too casual or i feel like they're not designed well i feel like i will lose confidence quickly and just won't do them. i have a sense the business i would be developing, or at least would be utilizing these skills in, would be landscaping and home design. i don't know if this is relevant, but i thought i should mention it here. especially since there are a lot of different types of business classes. thanks for any insight! edit i'm a very much learn-from-doing type of person, which makes me hesitant to take online courses as i feel i might retain nothing. my college experience also makes me wary of my ability to commit to/learn from courses . this is why i am so concerned with the structure/design/quality of the courses. just something to consider.	huuugggttfdf	/r/business/comments/fm5fwm/what_is_my_best_option_for_online_business/	2	3	0	1.0	1584748203.0

im 17 and need business advice	hi, im a 17 year old entrepreneur. im looking to start my first online business. up to this point ive ran a couple offline businesses selling at multiple flea markets and also have done fairly well selling on ebay. id like to start an online niche marketplace. i have a solid business plan and an estimate of what itll cost to get up and running. its not incredibly expensive, but its a lot for a 17 year old. ive never started an online business, and am scared to put most of my savings on the line launching this idea. should i go for it, or find a less expensive model to try to get a feel for online businesses before i put that much money at risk?

what will the consumer want when the crisis is over?	no matter how terrible the economic recession is, which is waiting for us around the corner, the consumers will still remain in the market. money will not be withdrawn from circulation. when the crisis is over, we're in the same world as before, but a worse version of it. that means the main question will still be what business often forgets to ask in calm times, i.e. what will the consumer want tomorrow? as of today, entrepreneurs around the world are tormented by other questions. how to get help from the state? how to reduce payroll expenses? how to negotiate a reduction in rents? how to repay the loan? but no matter how important these questions are, there is a more important question, i.e. what will your consumers want after quarantine, and how will you be able to offer them that? the difference between those who will survive the crisis and those who will not is whether they will ask this question and what answer they will find. what will they buy after the crisis? in the acute quarantine period, the following items will be in demand 1. medicine. 2. everything about home entertainment from board games to video streaming services. 3. online courses and training. 4. delivery of food from restaurants and stores. 5. e-books. 6. tv series. as soon as the pandemic disease has passed, the demand will increase for the following items 1. delivery. delivery services will continue to grow as more and more people have tried them and now will not give up. 2. cooking . restaurants will become unaffordable for many people, but people will not like cooking again. so cooking, especially with delivery, will be in trend. 3. temporary hiring agencies. businesses will be more interested in temporary employees as unemployed people will be looking for some job at least. 4. interim management, that is, hiring top managers on a temporary basis, for the project. you manage an ongoing project and your contract expires when the project is implemented. no permanent employment. 5. online education in different domains, including business. 6. software and devices for remote work. 7. automation for all that helps reduce costs. simple solutions that do not require huge costs will be in demand. 8. repair of everything from shoes to appliances and telephones. 9. power tools, as people will repair their things themselves again, at least some of them. 10. medical examinations. scared of the pandemic, people will see doctors more frequently. 11. equipment for independent and cheap tourism, i.e. tents, skis and campo vans. 12. everything for the cottages, including seeds, glass-houses and garden tools as many people will grow vegetables in their country houses again. and what else do you think will be in demand?	sbiryulin	/r/business/comments/fstr30/what_will_the_consumer_want_when_the_crisis_is/	2	10	0	1.0	1585720206.0
is anyone interested in creating a new company solely sourced by redditors? during the covid-19 pandemic	hey everyone! i have this crazy but potentially worthwhile idea. what if we created a totally crowdsourced company consisting of reddit users? the current climate is particularly terrible for finding new work. but what if if we were to pool resources together to create a new company? before i begin diving into an explanation i will explain a little about myself. i have a background in digital marketing and website development but also experience in a variety of sectors . i am a product development manager for a virtual reality company based out of atlanta. in 2014, i started my own consulting firm and was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with a number of different startups over the last 6 years. i have had several ideas for new startups during this time i have kept in my back pocket for a rainy day remote situation. one of these ideas, i have already completed extensive customer discovery for. i know the pain of the customer is there and the solution is quite simple. but i would need help in achieving this goal in all reality. totally open to pursuing new ideas as well! i know so many redditors have experienced being laid off or temporarily let go from their jobs and are sitting at home looking for something to do. so the thought hit me, what if we pooled our resources during this downtime and all worked together for a common goal? surely our combined industry experience could have this product to market in almost no time if we put in the work. the risks are incredibly low for this project besides the overall willingness to help. it's mainly just the investment of time and energy into developing something that has value for others. i am not propositioning this idea for personal gain but with the idea to help our community benefit during this crappy time. and to maybe have something to show for our efforts once things go back to normal. how cool would it be to say we started a successful company from an internet forum? i'm sure there are others out there who have done the same thing but the climate right now is much different than ever. if you have an interest in being a part of this whether you have no startup experience or tons i would love to talk with you. i think it would be so cool to start this idea together and measure our success as we grow. i look forward to seeing the variety of crazy responses i am sure i will get from this post. my only intent is to see how far we can take this idea. thanks! and hope you all stay safe, g	gratefulterminations	/r/business/comments/ft89t3/is_anyone_interested_in_creating_a_new_company/	2	0	0	0.38	1585773962.0

i have a fintech business idea. i would appreciate some feedback on this idea.	imagine a website where you can make money on the popularity of pop culture trends. thats what my idea is. you can invest in different trends and based on the popularity of that trend you can make money. its sort of like a stock market for trends & memes. for example if someone wants to invest in the stonks meme, if the meme popularity goes up based on the amount of shares it has on the internet the price of the stonks meme would rise in price and the investor could sell and make a profit. users would be able to buy, sell, short, and cover pop culture trends and memes. in a way itd be like skilled betting, because you technically cant have random people own a pop culture trend. in a way it would be a combination of buying and selling stocks and betting but for pop culture trends. its a silly idea but please tell me your opinion on this and if you think this could be a successful business. thank you for reading!	-SaagarD	/r/business/comments/fv9t19/i_have_a_fintech_business_idea_i_would_appreciate/	5	1	0	0.56	1586071037.0

taking over my company's e-commerce platforms, any suggestions on strategies?	i work for a very small company of under 10 employees. we do around 600k in e-commerce sales yearly through amazon , wayfair, bed bath and beyond, macy's, and other similar drop shipping websites. after learning a lot from this subreddit and other similar subreddits, i have been put in charge of managing all of our content on these websites. we have been steadily declining sales from over 1m down to 600k yearly from the past few years. a lot of this has to do with the oversaturation of sellers on the market but a lot of it has to do with us not putting any time into our product listings, never adding our new products , seo, and various other things. do you guys have any strategies for a small company that's selling on many different sites? i am thinking that 75% of my time should be spent focusing on amazon since that is where most of our revenue comes from. we also only do maybe two sales a day on our own company website, with such a higher profit margin selling direct to consumer, this may be something worth spending a lot of time on. we are a wholesaler so that is why we never focused on our own b2c website, but with retails stores dying at an incredible rate, especially during and after this pandemic, we should be focusing a lot of time on our own retail site. i looked and we have thousands of newsletter/email signups from over the years to take advantage of if we need to advertise something like free shipping. we have never done free shipping on our own retail site , and i think we need to advertise free shipping on orders above 75$. if any of you have any thoughts/suggestions, please let me know. thank you!	smithz1123	/r/business/comments/g4b0x9/taking_over_my_companys_ecommerce_platforms_any/	2	4	0	1.0	1587315401.0

is anyone interested in creating a new company totally sourced by redditors? during the covid-19 pandemic.	hey everyone! i have this crazy but potentially worthwhile idea. what if we created a totally crowdsourced company consisting of reddit users? the current climate is particularly terrible for finding new work. but what if if we were to pool resources together to create a new company? before i begin diving into an explanation i will explain a little about myself. i have a background in digital marketing and website development but also experience in a variety of sectors . i am a product development manager for a virtual reality company based out of atlanta. in 2014, i started my own consulting firm and was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with a number of different startups over the last 6 years. i have had several ideas for new startups during this time i have kept in my back pocket for a rainy day remote situation. one of these ideas, i have already completed extensive customer discovery for. i know the pain of the customer is there and the solution is quite simple. but i would need help in achieving this goal in all reality. totally open to pursuing new ideas as well! i know so many redditors have experienced being laid off or temporarily let go from their jobs and are sitting at home looking for something to do. so the thought hit me, what if we pooled our resources during this downtime and all worked together for a common goal? surely our combined industry experience could have this product to market in almost no time if we put in the work. the risks are incredibly low for this project besides the overall willingness to help. it's mainly just the investment of time and energy into developing something that has value for others. i am not propositioning this idea for personal gain but with the idea to help our community benefit during this crappy time. and to maybe have something to show for our efforts once things go back to normal. how cool would it be to say we started a successful company from an internet forum? i'm sure there are others out there who have done the same thing but the climate right now is much different than ever. if you have an interest in being a part of this whether you have no startup experience or tons i would love to talk with you. i think it would be so cool to start this idea together and measure our success as we grow. i look forward to seeing the variety of crazy responses i am sure i will get from this post. my only intent is to see how far we can take this idea. thanks! and hope you all stay safe, g	gratefulterminations	/r/business/comments/g5l34b/is_anyone_interested_in_creating_a_new_company/	15	8	0	0.75	1587494972.0

what software exists that is used by service centers to handle incoming calls and are companies happy with them?	particularly, i've always wondered at why there is so much difficulty in verifying my identity and why i have to give over my basic information so many times . shouldn't the operator know who i am based on my cell phone number? why aren't these companies storing my information in my profile instead of requiring that i repeat myself when passed between departments? i'm hoping to build an application that resolves these sorts of issues, but i'm trying to determine what already exists on the market, what their pros and cons are, and how i can make the cs experience seamless.

how good would a location like this be for a dinner theater restaurant?	exact location 7461 kamehameha v hwy, kaunakakai, hawaii. this used to be the ah ping general store up until the late 1960s/early 1970s, then it was abandoned for a long time until someone converted it into a vacation rental house. but starting this year, vacation rentals with houses have been banned on this island, so its value went down. i have a feeling that if someone were to buy the place and convert it once more, it'd be a good location to have a dinner theater restaurant. if i did that, i'd have it open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but have the stage shows be during dinner, with a two-item minimum for admission. the only competition within a 12 mile radius is a convenience store with a fast food counter. also, it's a quarter mile away from the local elementary school, about half a mile away from a condo resort, situated between two home neighborhoods, and directly on the road to town one way and to beaches and parks the other way, so a lot of traffic passes by. how good of a location does this sound like it'd be?		/r/business/comments/g9fa1i/how_good_would_a_location_like_this_be_for_a/	2	3	0	1.0	1588042681.0

 how do i find my brand?	im 23 , married, homeowner, and i work a normal 9-5 office job and make a little below 60k a year, however with this job i am so freaking bored with it. like i feel that i am literally just working my life away doing some idgaf about. my job is a decent job, and im very thankful for it, but i want something bigger. i want to be able to have something i can scale to grow, instead of slaving away just to earn another load of work the next day. i want to do something im passionate about, something that lets me express and be myself. i dont care if i dont make money within the first two years, as long as im building up something that im passionate about. ive asked a couple guys about this back when i was 18, 19 and they told me to just try a whole bunch of different things, and see what i like. so i did, ive tried and started up like 5 businesss, but i eventually lost interest, no not because i wasnt making money. its because it just wasnt me, like its not what i wanted to be. i always get so angry and jealous going on instagram and looking at everybody with their brands and doing their passions, looking as if their living a fulfilling life. i want to find my brand, my passion. ive studied so much aspects of business and put my knowledge to the test and have done decent, but for some reason it never feels right. i dont wanna be known as a big time dropshipper, blogger, etc.. i am currently very knowledgeable in web development as my current job incorporates a little bit, and ive studied and created since i was 16. i am currently in a web dev startup. however i still want to have more of a millennial persona, like a clothing brand, influencer, or music artist. no young guys my age are web developers.. and no i am not complaining about my life, im very thankful for what i have. i just basically....want more. i am more of asking, how did you find your brand? what inspired you to do what youre doing? how did you know it was right to continue to pursue?

what is a no loss business idea ?	developing garment distributing business. this is kind of b2b business, but also connects with the customer. i have some experience in this business. you dont need to set up a shop. just sell it to shops on credit basis. big shops will not accept this kind of business, because they buy directly from the big dealers or directly from factories.try small shops, only thing they need from us is credit. means they will get the products from us and but pay after a month. more the credit period , more you can sell it to them. but getting the payment, you want to follow it up consistently. but there are other ways , ask for a space in their shop. place your own rack and place your items in that. monthly or weekly , visit once and get paid only for the sold items in the rack. this makes easier for shop owner to pay , as it is a smaller amount. also you can find out on yourself, which product is going well, how much business you are doing from a particular shop. based on that , you can dump your products. if any product is not doing well , you can replace it or transfer it to other shops. first you can try with 5 shops in different location and slowly make the progress. you can also try this out as part time business. but follow up is very important her thanks-warm regards---good luck for more business idea read	rohtashmehla	/r/business/comments/gbzrud/what_is_a_no_loss_business_idea/	3	1	0	0.67	1588390990.0
how to learn how to scale my business when i don't know how to?	i started a supplement business and built my own brand. it started out as a little side hustle, wasn't making too much money or getting too many orders. i do everything on my own, from capsuling, packaging a variety of supplement powders, and designing labels, fulfilling orders etc. just in the past few months i've gotten an incredible surge in order volume. revenue has skyrocketed. i am happy about that but am starting to run into a few issues. i want to learn how to be more efficient, what machinery i should get, how to go about fulfilling orders , if there's anything i could be doing to save time. an example is capsules. i use a rudimentary manual machine to make capsules and then distribute them into bottles that i seal. i want to automatize this process but don't know how to go about doing it. should i be hiring employees, should i get a warehouse instead of storage unit, how should i delegate tasks to these employees to make my business run as smoothly as possible. should i contact a business consultant or lawyer? thanks for any advice, i really am not sure what to do to help my business grow.

how do i price my specific business?	i am in the process of starting my own business, i'm going to give an example of the business model. were trying the get annual/monthly payments from bars, clubs in exchange for our service. these bars and clubs are all various sizes. we had the next two pricing options in mind divide the prices in three categories, for example small bars , medium bars/clubs , and big clubs/bars . lets say the price categories are along the lines of 20, 35 and 55. is this fair pricing? there's a decent chance the biggers clubs/bars will benefit more from our service and they have alot more to spend so it seems logical to charge them more. a concern here is that bigger clubs could get upset about paying more than small bars. the second option is to have 3 packs along the lines of gold platinum diamond. each having certain benefits but giving the choice to the bar/club owner to decide. a concern here is that big clubs are more likely to always choose diamond because they can afford it easier in comparison to a small bar. also it seems like a challenge so far to really create relevant differentation between the three packs. so are issue is that our customers are all in various sizes and financial situations. we are open to any other possible ways of payment. do we charge them based upon their size? is there any literature or insight someone here can provide me? i'm new here but we've had this question floating trough our mind for a while now so i thought maybe someone here could give some insight. thanks!

customer intentionally messing up cheques. please help!	i've been a sub trade of this company for almost a year and received about 5 cheques from them. well the last two have been a shit show. the first one was written all over because his printer ink was running low. i brought it to the issuing bank, they called and verified it was him who wrote on it and proceeded to certify it for me. i then met with my bank manager who did her due diligence and deposited the cheque. well the back office pinged the cheque and froze all of my accounts for almost 2 weeks while doing their own investigation. eventually the cheque cleared. now the last cheque i just received is again written on and issued in my personal name, not my company name. they've been in business long enough to know how to write proper cheques. they've written 3 prior that were perfect. do i have any options here to scare/ penalize them for consistently doing this? this is a 5 figure cheque that i've already been waiting over a month for.	czechme_out	/r/business/comments/gfk1aj/customer_intentionally_messing_up_cheques_please/	9	8	0	0.9	1588902533.0

what would you do if your employee did this?	me and my brother own and operate a small/medium business, and we had decided that all office staff would get a 3% increase this year. our accountant prepared the salary sheet for our payroll person to enter the info into the pay system. all the salaries match up with the correct increase amount, except the accountant, she tacked on an extra 0.11$ an hour to her own salary without checking with us. it was not a mistake, when the payroll person asked her about it she replied to get it approved by my brother. when confronted this morning she says that she was sure he would see it, and that she felt she deserved the extra increase. now that's just an impact of a couple hundred bucks a year, but by principle, isn't she technically trying to steal from us? scares the hell out of me having someone capable of pulling a stunt like this in charge of our finances. what do you think reddit? is it attempted theft? would you fire her? she's definitely not getting the extra 0.11$ that's for sure!

why do you think the pbs kids channel, and pbs kids sprout never really took off?	on september 6, 1999, pbs changed the branding of its children's programming lineup to pbs kids. in addition to the traditional daytime block that airs on pbs, pbs kids was also available as a 24/7 channel that launched on the same day. the channel was available on directv channel 295, as well as being distributed by stations who paid a $1,000/year license fee. stations would either air short simulcasts of the channel during their main daytime block lasting five or more hours, broadcast the channel on a local cable system, or broadcast the channel as a separate over-the-air signal. it was primarily made to compete with noggin, a 50/50 joint venture between nickelodeon and the children's television workshop, which launched on february 2, 1999 and was designed as a 24/7 edutainment channel for preschoolers and pre-teens. because all of the cable rights to ctw's programming belonged to noggin, no ctw-produced series were ever allowed to be aired on the pbs kids channel. dragon tales and sagwa, the chinese siamese cat were the only exceptions to this. the channel was very unsuccessful and was way behind noggin in both subscriber count and ratings. as a result, pbs decided to launch the pbs kids sprout network, as a four-way joint venture between themselves, sesame workshop , hit entertainment, and comcast. pbs kids sprout officially started as a video-on-demand service for digital cable and satellite services on april 4, 2005. it was later launched as a 24/7 channel on september 26, 2005, after noggin's rights to sesame workshop programming expired, taking over the space of the pbs kids channel on directv and existing cable services, while also expanding to new cable and satellite services. it featured both cherry-picked programming from pbs kids , as well as original and acquired programming from its co-owners. about half of the 350 pbs stations gave up their kids channel and promoted pbs kids sprout, receiving grants as a reward. pbs kids sprout did not replace the traditional pbs kids branding on the standard pbs daytime block, and the other half of the 350 pbs stations refused to turn their kids channel over to pbs kids sprout, instead locally programming their own 24/7 pbs kids channel. pbs kids sprout was also unsuccessful, though less so than the pbs kids channel was, and around 2009 it started to refer to itself on-air as simply sprout and slowly started to distance itself from the pbs kids brand. hit entertainment was sold by apax partners to mattel on october 24, 2011, but the pbs kids sprout ownership stake was retained by apax. sesame workshop sold its stake in december 2012. apax's stake was sold on march 19, 2013, and pbs's stake was sold on november 13, 2013, making comcast the sole owner and ending the pbs kids sprout branding for good. what do you think went wrong with these channels?		/r/business/comments/gk7fmt/why_do_you_think_the_pbs_kids_channel_and_pbs/	2	1	0	0.66	1589542348.0

i want to start a lawn care/landscaping business and a media business and then quit my job and when i can live off of it, any advice?	i have known for a long time that i want to be my own boss. my dad and his dad both owned their own hvac businesses and they were really successful for a long duration of time. i currently work for a local construction company and i have learned a lot as well as got to use some of my own personal skills i developed through out my life. i have always enjoyed making home movies, youtube videos, etc and i have become pretty good at doing it. at this construction company, they asked if i could help out with their social media so i made some awesome videos and photo posts for them and grew their accounts big time! this gave me an idea to start my own social media marketing company that does all of the videography and photography in house. im also branching off and doing wedding videos and photo shoots to pay off my equipment. i invested into a $4,500 camera package and only owe about $1,300 on it now with at least $1,500 worth of more jobs this year to tackle. as far as the lawn care/landscaping with also small construction projects, its just something i also happen to enjoy. i have a good friend who does commercial lawn mowing for a living. he maintains over 60 yards by himself and i help him in my spare time when he gets behind because of the rain. i know this sounds extreme and that most people recommend starting just one company and building one company at a time but life is short and i need to build some capital. im also tired of working and building other peoples dreams when the benefits of working on my own are so much greater. do i want to run both of these businesses for the rest of my life? probably not but i do want to earn as much as i can and have the means to invest into all the different industries that im interested in. i used to dream of being super rich but the older i get the more i realize that i would rather just have all my bills paid off and a couple hundred thousand sitting in the bank with the ability to take time off when i want to. my end goal is to be financially free and im willing to put in the work to get there. so if you were me, what steps would you take to accomplish these tasks? what would be your road map to success?

if spotify paid joe rogan over $100 million for his content, how do they expect to recover that revenue in subscribers?	i saw the jre deal today and was just thinking about how this would make financial sense for a streaming service. before i get into my thought process, im sure im overlooking something so im genuinely curious. if we round off rogans content to $100mm exactly and say that a spotify premium account costs $10 a month. youd have to attract 833,334 new users in a year to make that investment worthwhile. that could be broken down a bunch of different ways over different periods of time but i wouldnt estimate that almost a million people are willing to pay for solely joe rogans content. with this, i am considering that joe rogan has a huge following and tens of millions of views on a single podcast but id have to estimate that a good to fair portion of that audience already has spotify premium. the other portions probably pay for another streaming service and id imagine that jre would only be enough switching power for a small amount of those people. i also acknowledge that they are going to generate more ad revenue from free listeners but id venture to say that they are targeting paid users with this type of move and it wouldnt be a considerable amount in the scheme of the deal. in short, are joe rogans podcasts enough to actually attract slightly less than 850,000 new premium users or am i missing out on other sources of revenue? note tried to post this to eli5 but its speculatory...genuinely just trying to understand the thought process. edit i acknowledge ad revenue and user base. just trying to see if anyone had any general numbers as to conversion rate to premium because 1/10 to a paid service for one form of content seems high. ad revenue per user is relatively low and 8 million users wouldnt be enough to cover their purchase.

i have a business idea for a fintech app with a round up business model. i would appreciate if you could let me know if you would use this app and if this idea already exists.	the idea is an app where you can link your bank account to the app and whenever you make a purchase it would be rounded up to the nearest highest dollar or cent amount. the spare change from your everyday purchases would be put back into your bank account in order to build an emergency or rainy day fund. i believe this would be a really good idea for people who may not want to put in the time and effort to move parts of their income into an emergency fund and have the ability to move money into an emergency fund in small bite sized amounts. thank you for reading and i would appreciate some feedback for this idea and i would like to know if this idea already exists.	-SaagarD	/r/business/comments/gnswmf/i_have_a_business_idea_for_a_fintech_app_with_a/	5	1	0	0.67	1590049300.0
advice on next move.	i am currently working for a tyre importer that wholesales across the country of new zealand. i have been working here for 2.5 years. the company was barely keeping by when i joined and starting gaining them new clients through social advertising and marketing . with the new clients and business my workplace has been able to keep the doors open and are again profitable. my problem is this, the company has told me they will change my job description and position to head of sales and description to match but they say they don't have enough money to pay me any more. i'm on around 50k a year. now none of the actual jobs i've been doing would transfer very well at all. other than a general warehouse role. so my job prospects aren't that great. the job security here seems to be not too strong if sales fell. also they have told me if i left they would just count their losses and close up shop. the clients i have brought in account for about 60-70% of all sales. the stress of doing the work is a lot and i feel as if i need to run the whole operation just to keep a job. any advice would be very much welcomed. thanks in advance 	highkinglion	/r/business/comments/go5tux/advice_on_next_move/	9	1	0	1.0	1590096907.0
im 14 and want to know how to open my own restaurant.	now im not gonna own it now, i mean like in ten years. i feel like it has great cashflow and is fun to do. not to expensive and workers are reasonably cheap. you only need a few cooks probably 2 a shift. one person to work the register/ waiter. yall know that one from bobs burgers? basically im going for that, a diner like thing. bar with bar stools, few booths and tables. small restroom in the back. nothing crazy of food but maybe ill go for a theme or just do burgers and stuff like that. id think a nice restaurant would cost about less than 100,000$. of course you have to put rent but thats separate. im talking about kitchen equipment and commercial ovens, stoves, and fridges. also that fan thing that hang above stoves. id get a large one of those over the stoves. i wouldnt think i would have enough room to have one of those islands you see in five star restaurants but again im going for a small place. another thing im worried about is the next pandemic. or even this same one depending on how long this one lasts for. maybe i could start the business with someone else too, like a partner. i also know that rent is expensive depending on where you live but its worth it if you get a lot of traffic. but im sure the nicer the location you would want a bigger place. thanks yall!! by the way i am from texas if this helps but i plan on moving to florida because i love the beach and want to surf when im not working.		/r/business/comments/goyiqh/im_14_and_want_to_know_how_to_open_my_own/	9	2	0	0.67	1590207124.0

addicted to money/profit... need help on fixing my perspective	i created a business out of a small passion project around a year ago. it ended up doing better than i could have ever imagined. when the money kept growing, more and more of my focus started centering on maximizing profit. i've recently realized that i'm addicted to this money rush, to the point that i'm disappointed if daily earning don't hit an arbitrary goal i have in mind. to complicate things, im in school, and im spending less of my energy on my studies. every 30 minutes to an hour, i feel the need to check on how things are going and constantly find myself distracted from more important things in life. when i started this whole business, i didn't imagine that i'd be motivated by money. in the end, im feeling a lot of cognitive dissonance and shame. are there resources to address wealth addiction ? and are there any tactics to separate yourself from this endless dopamine-fueled circuit? the thought to ask r/business as there must be many of you who have learned how to manage these kinds of emotions through growth... please help. i don't have irl friends to talk about this stuff to either, and the others who know about this business think it's much smaller than it is.	eduroamDD	/r/business/comments/gpxmjv/addicted_to_moneyprofit_need_help_on_fixing_my/	4	0	0	0.5	1590355124.0

what factors would you take into consideration when deciding whether to buy an established business or start your own?	here is an applicable scenario i am watching unfold my friend works in a construction related industry and has for a few years. he wants to have his own business. he has been considering buying an established company, putting down as much as what you would pay for a house. this would be a businness loan. he owns his apartment in an expensive area outright and has an extremely wealthy father so he isn't coming from poverty. the niche he wants to get into is heavily competitive and large businesses have contracts with the government for example. given i had to explain a concept as simple as the difference between profit and revenue and given he tried to tell me a $600,000 business turned over $2 million in profit, i simply dont believe he has the aptitude to run a company that big. i found another worth $1.5m and after he was sent the info i kept prompting him and asking questions about the one he wished to buy. eg whats the revenue? whats the profit? what's included in the sale? isn't the equipment included in the sale, is that why the price is what it is? are the owners going to stay on board to train you? he couldn't answer a single question. i questioned him about the amount of work it takes and he said he won't run it, just own it and business would be business as usual .... he also got angry about the fact he had to sign a disclosure form and didnt seem to understand the technical and legal neccessity for that and said it made things suss... i had to explain to him it was related to them making sure he wasn't a competitor stealing the $$ info on their books or sticky nosing at their contracts for example but he still didn't understand. to start at the lower end of that industry it would take only a bit of money but far more work since you would have to find your own clients and contracts. to be honest i dont really know what route it would be advisable to take, i am not his business advisor. i have worked for myself for about 7 years as a subcontractor but not in the capacity of a business owner or adviser. but what factors do you take into consideration when you decide a. i would rather start from zero. or b. i would rather just buy this established company with a client base for a huge chunk of money.		/r/business/comments/gy17us/what_factors_would_you_take_into_consideration/	3	2	0	1.0	1591485562.0

what kind of business would this be considered?	so i've been interested in starting a business for a while that would essentially exist to provide resources to small businesses that could otherwise not afford them on their own. for example, if a business wanted to expand their marketing but couldn't afford to bring on a full time marketing person, for a one-time or ongoing retainer fee, they could go to this larger firm that would be able to take over their marketing with a team of professionals as part of their portfolio that would provide better quality content at a lower price than what it would cost the small business to hire their own marketing person. ideally this business could provide services like this for all aspects of operations from management to finance to marketing and everything in between. to my knowledge this is somewhat similar to business solutions or venture capital without the firm actually investing in an ownership stake in the small business. so would this be considered something like consulting or business solutions? and are there companies like this already? are they considered good a business to try to get into? thanks in advance for any input	vipor3d	/r/business/comments/gyhk3g/what_kind_of_business_would_this_be_considered/	2	5	0	0.86	1591554529.0

what is the name on a business credit card?	i'm fixing to create an llc and get a business credit card and business bank account for it. from what i've seen, business credit cards often have the business's name, as well as the owner's name. for example, if someone named john smith owned xyz, llc , the card might say john smith xyz, llc i am wondering something. when submitting credit card information online, the name on the card is typically asked for. what name should be specified with a business card? should it be xyz, llc or john smith or john smith xyz, llc . it would probably be best if it was xyz, llc because i've heard the name on the credit card should match the name on the bank account , or it may cause problems with the entity the information is submitted to. i'm assuming the bank account name would be xyz, llc . thanks	ans3456	/r/business/comments/h93jqa/what_is_the_name_on_a_business_credit_card/	8	0	0	0.25	1592174787.0

looking to start a clothing brand and i'm not too sure where to start. i have some questions on the manufacturing process, and would be interested in knowing where i can read up on everything.	firstly, it's mostly for hats, and i'll be trying to do some actual market research on before i jump right into getting these manufactured. i have some designs that i want to put on hats, so i figure i could pay someone to make the designs and have something written up that says that this is mine and that they designed it for me. i think that's how to start/end that. as far as manufacturing goes, this is where i'm confused. there are various manufacturers. do i literally just pay one for the hats, and then i sell them and keep all of the revenue? does it matter if i change manufacturers halfway through? i don't see why it would, but i don't know. this might depend on a contract with them, but i figured i'd just pay for x hats and then i'd sell them on my own website or whatever, and not at all give credit to the manufacturers since they were already paid. i suppose that these questions would also be applicable to the distribution process, although i figured i could just mail them myself for the foreseeable future since i don't expect to get large volume of orders. i'm just not sure where exactly to start in figuring this out, and i again would like to do some research into whether or not people would even want hats like this, but i would appreciate any advice or resources you may provide. thank you.	paxmlank	/r/business/comments/he61bh/looking_to_start_a_clothing_brand_and_im_not_too/	5	2	0	0.67	1592878666.0

question on the difference between industries and sectors 	hey everyone, a bit of a basic question but i have been asked to make a spreadsheet with a ton of businesses and list their sector and industry. the industry is simple enough, e.g. marketing or real estate. what is the actual sector though? for example, marketing. is marketing itself a sector or would that fall into the business services sector? how many sectors are there? i have read in some places there are 12 science, education, health, art. however, i have read on more business style sites that it would be more production, finance etc. i would really like to know how many sectors there are in this context and ideally what they are. if i know the context though i can find out online. a prime example i have is a store that sells clothing. i assume this is sector - retail, industry - apparel and accessories? or is retail the industry? i am a touch confused. i know this is back to basics stuff but i can't mess this one up. thank you!!	jiggyciggy	/r/business/comments/hemqci/question_on_the_difference_between_industries_and/	2	1	0	1.0	1592945389.0

what do you think of my economic plan to get rich?	i have two plans one as a single person and one was a couple . my single plan is to save up my money that i will make at dominoes . 12k on expenses and 24k in savings. in 1.5 years i buy/payoff a tesla and that eliminates almost all costs to maintain a vehicle like gas as it can go 250 miles without needing to fuel up. then i plan on getting a mortgage on a house and renting it out so i can pay it off in a little over 1 year. there are properties for about 100k where i am moving to. after that i plan to basically keep on taking out mortgages and using the same method accruing wealth and paying each house off faster and faster until i have 10 properties and am renting 9 out at about 2k a month. quick house payment math. house 1 30k + 24k = 54k a year down on the house making the 100k house payed off in under 2 years. house 2 24k + 24k + 24k = 72k payed off in 1.3 years. house 3 24k x 4 = 96 ~ 1 year house 4 1 year house 5 24k x 5 = 120 years house 6 24k x 6 = 144 years house 7 24k x 7 = 168 years house 8 24k x 8 = 192 years house 9 24k x 9 = 216 years house 10 24k x 10 = 240 years that will give me 216k a year without having to work and i will use that money to make business ventures like starting up a ninja gym for example. successful ones make between 200k and 500k a year. the other business venture would be buying up franchises by stealing their workers by agreeing to pay them say $20/h forcing the franchise to go under and then offering to buy it for cheep and reinstating the workers. i would do this to all the local franchises regardless of chains so that all the money made from fast food restaurants would go into my pocket. couple version is just twice as fast is this a good, okay, or bad business plan?		/r/business/comments/hgu27v/what_do_you_think_of_my_economic_plan_to_get_rich/	4	0	0	0.5	1593266664.0

i'm scared because i don't know how to handle bookkeeping/taxes. help!	i just started my business in february. everything else is great. i'm a mobile groomer, and i have the grooming, van care, and customer service handled. i'm making lots of money and i'm booked out over a month in advance. i'm so scared of the financial side of things. i track how much i make from each dog, write down my mileage each day, keep all of my receipts, but besides that i don't know what i'm doing. i have a bookkeeper and a quickbooks account, but i've had her go over how to use qb with me twice now and i retain nothing. i'm going to just end up paying her to handle my books, as i just don't seem capable of it right now. i just learned today that i need an accountant to do taxes, i didn't know the difference between a bookkeeper and an accountant until today. so i'm about to call an accountant my bookkeeper recommended and set up my first appointment. does anyone have any advice for me? i just finished up a meeting with my bookkeeper to relearn quickbooks and my heart is pounding because i feel so incompetent. i want to be good at this, and right now i feel like i'm flying by the seat of my pants.

who really buys expensive online marketing course about making money?	greetings ladies and gentlemen recently ive been interested in affiliate marketing, and im planning in promote high ticket marketing courses, supposedly to people who wants to create businesses and create money. the thing that ticked into my mind was, why would someone who is desperate in making money and pay such high prices for a marketing/business course? im asking this question since i'm trying to figure out who to target, cause the line between people who want to make money but dont have money at all and people with big starting budget is kinda hard to distinguish. thanks edit im thinking of dismissing the idea completely. it seems to be ethically wrong to indirectly support the idea of taking advantage of vulnerable people.

how to calculate the profitability of your agency?	research shows that most business takes 2-3 years to become profitable. so, if you started a new agency, chances are that you dont have great profits. you need a strategic plan to keep a close tab on your finances to start earning profits. but if your agency is older than 2-3 years and you still arent making any profit, you seriously need to reassess your expenditure and cash inflow. the tricky thing with running a profitable agency is that you cannot take it for granted. if your books showed profits in the previous years, it doesnt necessarily mean that your agency will make a similar amount of profit this year as well. clients come & go but you cannot control your expenses as easily. if 2 of your 5 clients left, you cant just fire 40% of your team, right?

young aspiring entrepreneur, open to all advice!	hi all! so for some years now ive really considered 2 business ideas that id like to pursue, i believe im ready to act on the 1st now & the other once im more settled in life. these are ideas completely created by me & i guess im looking for some sort of approval if you will, on whether they seem potentially prosperous or not since i personally have never seen them played out. 1st wood working i was leaning more towards the furniture side that i can make myself in the basement. ive also thought of the idea to make smaller pieces, maybe for example hidden gun compartment night stands. things that i could have all the prices finished w/ paint & maybe a simple guide to put together so that i could package & sell worldwide. also really using social media to my advantage & offer discount codes for sharing a small video i could put together of my products w/ website. im really good with my hands & currently a welder so i may as well get involved in some fab work such as building utility trailers. 2nd having some sort of dog business, maybe breeding golden retrievers/ labs plus training them. also thought if i can learn to train labs to duck hunt, i believe there is some sort of official papers for duck hunting labs? & that would really raise the value of them versus what i first buy them at. i know this is a lot, to anyone has has gotten this far, i thank you for your time regardless! im open to all advice, which is my reason for this post id love to hear different perspectives & advice from people who have experience to pass on!	brward1996	/r/business/comments/hw5j28/young_aspiring_entrepreneur_open_to_all_advice/	2	1	0	1.0	1595463424.0

i could use some ideas... how to find a junior partner	hi, i hope you can share some advice. im having difficulty finding the right person for a viable opportunity. i appreciate your help in advance. i own a small carpet cleaning and restoration company in south carolina. i have for the past two years had a great opportunity available. i initially tried hiring employees with the potential to be partners and after many attempts i have pretty much decided that route is not the direction i want to go. it felt like i was a babysitter. i know that is on me for not being systematized and all that. i am leaning toward selling off or subcontracting out at least one of my divisions that i no longer am able to fully keep up with but that could be lucrative for a go getter. i have all the skills to train them and everything they would need to make it a big success if they hustled. after several failed attempts with people who are either not a good fit or are not serious about the opportunity i am having a nearly impossible time connecting the opportunity with the people who could benefit by it. i worked with approximately 10 young men, and they all fizzled our for various reasons. im positive the majority of it is my fault for not being organized enough to offer them a bulletproof pre-planned package. but that is the problem, details are not one of my strength areas, i am just the type to keep at it until everything works out. it worked for me.... compounding that, i am swamped. i could use some suggestions. my latest idea is to sell a carpet cleaning van and equipment at fair market value with the possibility of letting them subcontract. they would own the equipment outright. i would like to find someone who wants to build their own sister-company i would also consider bringing on a junior partner in my existing company. i am leaning toward expecting a investment if it was the latter option. more to weed out people who are going to waste time then to try to grab money. but so far offering young guys a ground level opportunity just hasnt worked for me. if im going about it wrong i am definitely willing to listen to suggestions. thank you for reading!

a business i was thinking of marketing for could use a lot more help. how do i persuade them to pay me for assistance?	the title probably sounds weird. but it's a gentlemen's club. it's under new management and may have a bad rep but they open too early and close to early and also they don't serve alcohol due to laws about what the dancers can do depending on if alcohol is served or not. i spoke to the manager yesterday and he's all for me doing digital marketing for them but i've found some simple things they could do to improve and i don't want to give up value for free. issue is i don't have business credentials or experience. this is just me seeing weak points in the business and looking up ways to improve it. some solutions may require consulting a lawyer but there's other things they can put out there that can draw more people and possibly help them there longer. what can i do to have them consult with me?

a client is lying to me...now what?	tl;dr i'm 99% sure my client is lying to me and i'm not sure how to handle it anymore. asking for advice. background i'm a bookkeeper for multiple small businesses. i do bookkeeping, payroll, state tax filings, and i get files ready for the cpas to do federal taxes. earlier this year, a cpa called me about one of our shared clients - there was a big problem. the money i reported as income to the state was nowhere near what it should have been. it turns out, the client in question had the money going to a different account i never knew about. the cpa knew this because he had the 1099 form for the federal taxes. after repeated attempts to get the corrected information from the client, he finally sent me new numbers for his 2019 income with permission to correct his state returns soon. the problem is, when i add up the corrected numbers with what i already reported, i'm still only at half of the income number the cpa gave me. i'm really not sure how to handle this with the client at this point. should i play dumb and send an email saying something along the lines of i'm not sure why these new numbers don't add up to the cpa number? should i fire him as a client because i've previously explained that i can't knowingly commit fraud? do i just ignore it because the world is on fire and there are bigger things to worry about? something else? advice appreciated or direction to other subs if not appropriate here. edit there seems to be a consensus. thanks everybody!	blankempath	/r/business/comments/i0vbau/a_client_is_lying_to_menow_what/	7	2	0	1.0	1596146820.0

question to business owners and economists. how much of the economy runs on late or non-payment ?	how much loss do businesses need to factor as a result of willful delinquency and how does that scale with business size relative to the cost of the service. i'm an architect. my business involves high dollar people or entities who buy buildings. by definition my clients typically have a higher net worth than i do. but ability to pay is evidently in inverse relation to promptness. by the time a client pays, most or all banks consider the account delinquent. i cannot borrow against most accounts because most pay between 90 and infinity days from an invoice. my very best accounts are people who are in the same economic bracket as the rest of the service sector. how does the economy run in this reality ? how much of high value individuals wealth is actually just due to the fact that they expect you to starve before they will ?	iuseallthebandwidth	/r/business/comments/i6xf9x/question_to_business_owners_and_economists_how/	4	1	0	1.0	1597030423.0

what stops banks from hostile pricing?	i think this may apply to r/greed loosely but this seems more fitting. &; walmart has been known to destroy local businesses using hostile pricing. they sell items at an often extreme loss with the padding of a global corporation and kill any business that can't do the same . &; my main question is what is preventing banks from doing this? it would seem that whichever bank has the largest amount of cushon, would want to slowly take over by starting in small towns and destroying small, family owned banks by setting interests rates to 0% or negative. then when all the banks that locals have access to are removed, they move to the next city/state. as the company gains capital they can take bigger banks like an economic fish frenzy game. &; i'm sure there is an economics answer to this that isn't something ridiculous like banks/corporations are ethical .

need advice to convince ceo of b2b marketing	hello fellow marketeers, i'm 28 years old and currently quality manager in a poultry slaughterhouse. during my free time i do pizza catering and now with the corona i worked out a new project called buitengewoon which fills most of the needs that many people have during the corona crisis. however, i still don't want to do this fulltime. i actually just love doing marketing and pin out strategies. i feel that i'm less motivated during my time as qm. recently i've been trying to sollicitate for marketing jobs but they believe i don't have the experience i should have to be able to start, which i understand. now i've been playing with the idea of talking with the ceo to ask for a new function in our company. however, we have only a sales team and nobody for marketing. i know the ceo do not believe in the added value of marketing for our company, since we are b2b. i need to explain and show the added value of marketing if i want to create this new function for our company. the following problem is that i'm not experienced with b2b marketing and if i consider talking with the ceo about this, i need to have a plan. i need to have a vision that can make a difference in our b2b approach and something that will increase our sales. can somebody give me some ideas on how to approach this problem and maybe some lecture for b2b marketing in the food sector or similiar activity? thanks in advance.

one guy tries to make my family bankrupt and close our farm, i really don't know what to do.	in brief summary my grandpa, who made a couple of businesses owed to one guy a little bit of money in 2012, and now, after the accidental death of my grandfather, my family owe a great deal of money to that guy, who wants to close grandpa's shop and farm which my grandpa was working on for 20 years. in details we are from ukraine. in 2012 grandpa took 400 000 uah in credit . but the currency uah usd was 8 uah per dollar. and in the next 5 years, it changed to 25 uah per dollar, and with additional percent, he owed 1 300 000 uah... in the next 3 years, that sum has grown to 1 800 000 uah . and our lovely grandpa died one week ago because of the heart attack... we wanted to continue his work with a big farm and little shop in zaporozie, but it happened that the guy he owed money filed an application to the court, and now they are about to take everything from us... we don't have even a 20% of the needed sum. court sentenced a sail of farm and shop in order to pay the debt. my father, who was among the part of the family who wanted to continue our grandpa's business now applied to appeal to the court, but with the only purpose of postponing the decision. but actually we are completely out of ideas. perhaps we'll make a meeting with the guy who applied to the court and propose him money after we will sale the farm. if you have any ideas about what we can do or where to get the money, i'll be pretty thankful to hear that.

how do i approach management when i see a needed process improvement	tl;dr how do i approach upper management with a needed process improvement as mid-level employee, without coming across in the wrong way? tia company background real-estate acquisitions, been around since the 50's, family owned but only a few actually work for the company, has around 150-300 employees across the country depending on the economy. we buy land for municipal infrastructure, and have many contracted employees. we have appx 35 corporate employees that run the day-to-day ops; acct, hr, mktg, etc. process improvement this company has always seemed to be slow to update their processes, for instance hand stamp mail, hand stuff mail, using excel for timesheets, original fax machine from the 80s still used and website looks to be from the 90s. the process issue i see from my limited perspective as a contract employee, is hr and payroll. we are currently using excel to build our timesheets, for each individual contract we are on. i'm currently on 4, some are on 6+. just for mine alone, it takes nearly 2 hours, as we can't just copy & paste. goal to approach upper management with a new approach to hr and payroll, to be more efficient and user friendly. paycom and wrokday are the first to come to mind. how do i approach upper management with this idea, without coming across in the wrong way?	rod2480	/r/business/comments/ic3mkz/how_do_i_approach_management_when_i_see_a_needed/	2	1	0	1.0	1597766065.0

looking for some advice on how to respond to an objection a potential client has raised about our product	so i sell decentralised ventilation i.e. one ventilation in it per room. each unit had a filter which must be changed annually. we are up against a centralised air handling unit i.e. one unit serving a number of rooms. each one of these had a filter which must be changed annually. the potential client has come back saying they are concerned about the burden of maintenance with our product because historically, filters arent changed as regularly as they should be. my proposal was for us to generate a service contract such that the maintenance is our responsibility for an annual fee. this was stated in the initial meeting, and his comments followed this. i offered him a number of existing customer contacts for him to speak to, at his request, but i dont believe hes spoken to any of them. i was hoping to get some advice on how to respond to this guy. my instinct is to say something like the following, but i have been known to react without thinking with all due respect, the maintenance issues that is describing related to his past experience of maintenance operatives employed by , experiences which bear no reflection on us. hes not the only person that needs convincing, but hes the only person to raise an issue. how can i handle this?	dirtychinchilla	/r/business/comments/icun9y/looking_for_some_advice_on_how_to_respond_to_an/	13	1	0	1.0	1597865689.0
companies who lost their core business and changed to a new one by using their core competencies	i'm interested in reading more about companies who did just that. one interesting example i've found is fujifilm . they started out in 1934 by producing different kinds of films . fast forward to the 21st century and people bought less and less analogue films . so they leverage ed key photographic film technologies to develop original skincare products . e.g. by using collagen which is a crucial substance in both photographic film and human skin or antioxidants and nanotechnology which apparently are being used in photographic film technologies as well as for skincare. ten years after entering this entirely new market for this company, by their own information, fujifilm makes close to 100 million usd in revenue each year . summary i find that very intriguing and inspiring and would love to read more about similar examples where a company uses it's core competencies of a dying industry to enter a new one successfully.

foodtruck in norway - advice needed	hey guys! my father lives in norway for couple of years now, speaks fluent norwegian and loves to cook. i also enjoy making food, and have pretty good taste. he came with idea that we could start a foodtruck with hamburgers, kebabs or something else, since he's tired of his current work and always wanted to have a gastronomy business. he lives in city that's very popular among tourist yet there are only two low quality places where you can eat. here are my questions 1 how hard is running a foodtruck if neither of us had any experience in working in gastronomy? it seems simple but i guess i would have to spend a month working in such place. or do you think that simply speaking with someone who worked in such place would be sufficient? 2 are there any traps in setting such business in norway specifically? is their market unique in some way? 3 any general protips in starting foodtruck business? any must read/watch or something?

help about how to manage a client	i am new to this community and i need some advice related to a new independent services i have started providing recently. if my question isnt allowed here then please feel free to ignore and i apologize in advance. so i have recently joined an internet platform which is basically a freelance platform for developers. i have started with a fee of $8 per 15 minutes session and slowly i raised it to $10. at this point i have created a small loyal clientale who felt comfortable to keep using my help whenever they needed. a few weeks back i have raised my fee to $11 which everyone happily agreed to and some of them even asked me to raise it to at least $15 because they said i deserved it. however i kept it at $11. there is this one client who actually got surprised and asked me to make my fee back to $10. i did not want to harm my relationship with him so i gave him the benefit of the doubt that he wasnt ready just yet. now at least 3 weeks have passed and he has been taking my help quite a lot and he always insists to put it back to $10 whenever we he needs my help. i just dont know if i should go on like this or i should ask him. i also feel bad about it, thinking that he might not afford it but $1 doesnt seem like such a big amount, it does make a difference for me though. he also seem to have his own business so sometimes i feel like he is just fooling me because i am letting him. i am new to this. i used to work in companies where i never had to negotiate about money to the clients, i just had a fixed salary. any advice would be highly appreciated.

how does devaluation of the chinese currency impact american companies?	so i was watching a few videos on donald trump, and i saw a video of his speech in cpac 2014 where he talked about how the chinese were devaluating their own currency which hurts american companies. in what way is this true? i'm not much of a business guy however this interested me a lot and i searched this up and found that the search concludes that lowering the currency leads to more exports, would this also impact outsourcing of jobs from america to china? would love if someone could explain this to me as if i knew nothing.

i am helping my uncle with the finances of his upcoming business, and i need help understanding exactly what i need to do.	i am currently a full time student, and my uncle works for a telephone cable laying company. specifically, he splices cables. he has already worked out in advance that he can find work if he starts his own company and goes solo, but now he just has to start the company and buy tools, a vehicle, and so on. i took a general business class and consider myself a fast learner, but i don't know exactly what i would be doing. from what limited conversation i've had with him, he knows all the details of what he needs to do on the legal side of things, but he isn't good with accounting. i have always been a math guy, and this could be an opportunity for me to make some money, as well as get experience with finances and such. now to the questions. 1. what should i expect to be doing exactly? all i know is that every 2 weeks i need to create an invoice that has something to do with the larger businesses hiring him, and manage the purchases he makes. i'm assuming i also have to manage the taxes and deduct things like gas from it, but again, i'm kind of clueless. if this cant really be explained over reddit, where can i go to learn all of this? 2. this is only something he reached out to me about today and is much simpler. what are the rules with naming the business? he has a couple name ideas but i don't know where to go to find out if those names are already taken and what the rules are with similar company names. 3. what programs are good for this exact purpose, or where should i look to find programs for this? he said they don't need to be free. what i mean by this exact purpose is that it is a business run by one person, but just me doing finances, so it doesn't need to be optimized to handle hundreds of people or have specific permissions or anything fancy like that. thank you in advance for any help given to me. all of this is kind of a lot to ask from strangers on the internet so if there is even a website that can help me get started with all of this just a name would be awesome. thanks again.

why is it said that zoom has no network effects?	my doubt is doesnt each user that uses zoom make the product more valuable for other users just as it is the case with the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each? ben thompson says this all might not matter if zoom were able to use the massive surge in usage to create network effects that lock users into the service. thats the thing though zoom is so popular and so viral in part because it has no network effects. only a host needs an account; everyone else just clicks a link. is it the point that because you can use zoom without having an account the value of it to users doesnt increase when someone joins zoom because the value stays the same for users no matter if people create an account or not? also, is a person only considered to have joined the zoom network if they create a zoom account?	fuufufufuf	/r/business/comments/ikyiun/why_is_it_said_that_zoom_has_no_network_effects/	2	0	0	0.5	1599014269.0

i dont know where to start from to start my own business	hey guys, so this is a pretty generic question but im graduating college in 4 months, and starting a full time job making $75k/ year in jan. i have no debts at all, 11k saved from doing part time in an emergency fund. i want to have my own business one day and my dad is willing to help me start with 40k, but bec of my young age i have no experience at all in what exactly i want to have my business in. i was wondering if anyone here was in my shoes at some point and figured it out later, if so how did you do it? a lot of people told me wait and keep researching and you will find something, others told me to make as much connections as possible and try to invest in someones business since it will save you a lot of time, money and effort. all i want is to own something that at some point will make me more money than my 9-5, bec being an employee there is only so much i can earn but i feel like if i have a business sky is literally the limit. what are your guys thought?

how to profit from saving businesses money?	i used to work in the transportation business and have seen many businesses waste money daily. one example of how they waste money is by ordering a shipment to be delivered as fast as possible and their shipment would be delivered to their office hours before anybody is in to receive it which can cause the shipment to be brought back and reattempted at a later time. if these companies knew that ordering a cheaper delivery time would get them their shipment at the same time they already do or sooner due to there being no reattempt needed it would save them a lot over time. i believe a big reason that this consistently happens is because usually it is the shipper that pays the delivery fee and the recipient businesses never tell the sender it is unnecessary to send the shipment the fastest most expensive way because they wont be in the office when it arrives. is there any way to profit from informing these businesses how they can save a lot of money over time? would it be unethical to try saving the businesses that i know are wasting money this way due to the fact that it would be hurting my previous employers revenue?

advice to start up a business as a young female?	so to start off, im a 19 year old female. i know im young, i know this is a big endeavor, and im not completely serious about it right now, just wanting to know what i would be getting into. also, any hate comments will be deleted. so theres this skating rink in my small town, thats been around for like 40-45 years i believe. it was really popular when it was open, especially in the 70s and 80s, you know like it would be. towards the 2000s and 2010s, it started to become a sketchy hangout on friday and saturday nights for teens and others wanting to sell drugs to them , so it deterred a lot of families and just other people in general. it slowly lost business and closed down about 3 years ago. the same old man ran it forever, and i think is wanting 1-2 million for the establishment. the building is obviously very large, a large skating area, a ramp area that used to be used with skateboards back in the 80s but he eventually banned. theres lots of storage in the back, an arcade area, some vending machines and a side room that people hosted parties in, and bathrooms. its not the cleanest place, but its not awful from what i remember. my dad and i have always talked about opening it up and making it cleaner, more family friendly, and nostalgic. making it 70s/80s themed, keeping the small old arcade games and pool/air hockey/ping pong tables, having a small snack/concession area, a skateboarding area and opening the ramp area up, keeping the party hosting room, etc. i know this is a huge thing to do, but it includes things ive loved and grown up around, along with my dad. i was wondering how i would go about starting that. is that something i could get businesses to sponsor? it was a huge thing in my area, especially since theres nothing else to do around here really. the bowling alley is doing really well, and i would want to do about the same thing with the skating rink. any advice, steps, anything helps. thank you all.

what would you do in this situation ?	hello, i am thinking about ways to make quick money -- yes! i get it. that's not how it works. first, time and effort must be paid to bere the fruits of labor. i can assure you my financial vision & plans are already pretty long term. however, right now, i'm quickly running out of food and i'm starting to get literal headaches bc of it. it's actually getting kinda real for me. i'm currently in germany so i know there are institutions i can go to before i'd actually starve. my family would probably welcome me should i wash up on their porch as well. though, i am looking to avoid even having to let them know about the struggle. i'd rather find out a way to make a quick buck or two so i can stay above water for a little longer. i've been thinking about freelancing but i really lack the skill. i thought about drop servicing but that seems to take some time to properly set up, especially because i need to first set up a profile with references, and that in general looks legit. i'm currently building an ebay store but the last money i made from that, was 2 month ago. than life happened and i am just now getting back into fixing my store up. i'm not expecting much from my ebay store to come in for this month at all. i though about buying water bottles in bulk and selling them on the streets but it's getting too cold for that to be viable let alone the reality that i have nothing to buy the water with. i'm counting pennies rn. i have pretty much sold everything i own. i still got an old gopro that i am getting rid off at the moment. that could actually bring in a buck. my uber license is in the works. because of cov19 the paper work is taking its sweet time here in germany. there is other things i've been thinking about doing. from selling feet pics to selling on shopify. the thing is i need the money as soon as possible. i have no real world qualifications and absoulty no euro to give. and i'm trying to avoid reciving financial handouts, from my family, or the government, or anyone to be honest. i'd love to know what some of you would think of doing in a situation like mine. any creative idea is appreciated and i'd love to engage in a discussion with you.

creating an ecommerce website on woocommerce for the first time? checklist for website building and what plugins and extensions should i install?	hello internet, i am creating an ecommerce store on woocommerce with the help of a web developer, haven't hired one but i am about to hire someone. this is the first time i am making a website so don't know about many things. i would be forever grateful if you could help list down all things that i should take care of to develop a great and smooth running and working ecommerce website. i know of few things that i am required to do such as domain registration, web hosting, ssl certification, theme/template for my website, web builder, payment gateways, security , etc. but i know there are also a lot of other things that i should take care of, so if you can, then please help me note down what other things that i should take care of. i will personally research each and every category to know what is the best solution that works for me or makes my website better, for example, i know for ssl certification - let's encrypt is a good option. if you have a personal recommendation in those categories then please feel free to mention them. also same with the plugins and extension that i should/must install for woocommerce. both different types /areas of plugins such as payment gateways, shipping and tax calculations, and other areas, also recommendations in those plugins if you have any. i know i can ask the web developer but knowing all this stuff will help me make better decisions and know what and why they are important for my website and what i am paying for, it can also help me in the hiring process for a web developer. some context about the store. it's an ecommerce website for modern toys and games for kids with around 500 to 1000+ products, both local and international shipping and maybe even drop shipping, rental, and slot booking functionality. thank you, and would really appreciate any input, thanks once again.

majority of employees want co-founder out of biz but we have $1.4m in liabilities. is he responsible?	co-founder has 28% fully vested in 5-year old llc. over the last 12 months, a majority of our employees have spoken to both me and other employees about not wanting to work with the co-founder anymore. a few weeks ago a few key employees gave me an ultimatum so it's time to split. we have accrued $1.4m in debt. about $500k is money i personally loaned to the business, $75k is money he loaned, $400k is in government loans that i personally guaranteed, and the rest is from individuals that loaned to me personally for the business. i presented him with 3 exit options and he is arguing that he's not responsible for any of the debt, claiming that would an employee who was given 1% equity be responsible for 1% of the debt? . imo those are different share types, but maybe i'm wrong. 1. is he responsible for 28% of the debt? 2. if so, would a fair exit be value of equity minus value of debt? the 3 options presented were a walk away free and clear of all debt obligations and get $x/mo for 10 years, where x is reduced if we lose certain clients. b walk away and retain equity and receive profit distributions equal to equity, only once half of our liabilities are cleared. c walk away free and clear of debt, and take 20% of our clients. this was the most generous offer and he is arguing for 28% of our clients because he does not believe he's responsible for the debt. is he wrong? why or why not? any other exit options that would make sense for him/me?	queensgambit52	/r/business/comments/j92qln/majority_of_employees_want_cofounder_out_of_biz/	3	3	0	1.0	1602409970.0

there are zero plastic container recycling plants in canads why?	with the abundance of canabis products being sold in plastic containers usually much bigger than what is needed to contain the weed that is inside them. why the hell do we not have a factory or plant to process these plastics and repurpose them. that is a lot of potential jobs for canadians. instead the containers are being shipped off to europe to be recycled. i mean this is just stupid from my perspective and it could be benefitting canadians with potential work where ever we built these factories in the country. but not only this the government could offer insentive like they do with recycling beer bottles & pop cans. by paying you like 0.05 or 0.10 per container you return. and allow you to save that up and cash it out whenever you wanted. just a thought. -made a typo with the title canada.	deathadder90	/r/business/comments/jaofrc/there_are_zero_plastic_container_recycling_plants/	10	2	0	0.63	1602629451.0

ex-client refusing to pay up. what are my options?	i worked as a consultant with a fitness firm. we signed a contract and work was good as well. they decided to hire me for secondary service mid-way which i gladly accepted as an extra income source. however, we don't sign a contract for that service as a sign of trust. i too let it pass in good faith. fast forward two weeks, the client decided to hire an in-house manager which meant i was no longer needed. i end things amicably. it has been 20 days since then no money has been released till now for the work i did. it is a substantial amount as it makes 45% of my monthly revenue. they are directing me from one department to the other. they are not even receiving my calls now. i do have a contract but for the other work that i did, i have nothing except whatsapp messages. what are my options from here? involving legal authorities is my last option as i dread the complications. i also, want to know - how to avoid such a scenario in future where you're working as a 3rd party service provider. any help is appreciated. thank you	WhatRemainsAfter	/r/business/comments/jbp1qt/exclient_refusing_to_pay_up_what_are_my_options/	7	2	0	0.67	1602773664.0

 need advice . how to convince neighbor we wont steal his customers	my business partner and i have been looking for a location to start a collision services business. we are a one stop shop for people who experienced problems with their vehicle that would require insurance to be involved. we set up the claim, deal with the insurance, obtain their rental, pick up their vehicle, setup the repairs, detail the vehicle and return it. we have searched for 6 months for a perfect location and found it. the landlord was going to rent to us but the body shop that rents in the same building is against it. saying we will steal his customers. all our customers are going to be scheduled and are coming from my business partners rolodex. we arent interested in his drive up cash customers looking to haggle prices. we have tried to convince him till we are blue in the face. we even offered to give him work from our pool of clients but he keeps going back to what if you give my customers better prices? is there anything we can put in the lease to assure him or any ideas to what we can do to show him we arent full of hot air? if not we lose the spot and i cant afford to do this for another 6 months.	tonitoni81	/r/business/comments/jcfaty/need_advice_how_to_convince_neighbor_we_wont/	2	0	0	0.5	1602872821.0
advice	good morning, all! im a new business owner and have hit some roadblocks. my partner is consistently criticizing my management style and is saying that im struggling with basic office tasks such as following deadlines. i want to put out there that yes, sometimes my deadlines are not met due to unforeseen situations that cause me to need to reprioritize what is on my task list. for example, i have been creating data sheets and graph documents on google sheets for data collection purposes. she was waiting for these documents. i experienced many formatting issues that pushed my due date back . for her this is the end of the world and it turns into her accusing me of cutting corners because its not 100% perfectly done on the due date. for me, there is no sense in getting hung up on it because it took the amount of time it did so i could ensure there were no errors. the main issue of having different managing styles is grating. we are equal partners and this is both our first time owning a business... and we live together. i want to avoid having issues like this in the future and make it work because where i am bad at something she is good at it and vice versa. does anyone have any resources about becoming a better manager? i want to do everything in my power to understand her method of thinking and make things work so we are not encountering so many bumps in the road due to things we are currently writing off as personality differences. thanks in advance!!	gabZy421	/r/business/comments/jcug1n/advice/	5	0	0	0.5	1602938497.0
how do i respond?	ive started my photography business recently, because its something i enjoy and i want to make money off of it. i was at the gym a few days ago taking pictures for someone and another person came up to me and started telling me their life story then followed up by asking if i can take their pictures. i obviously accepted, and made it clear to this person that this is my business. after a day they offered to give me free sessions of a bunch of things at the gym in exchange for my services. when i told them again that this was my business and that i needed the money, they persisted with the same thing and said that it would bring me more clients. ive never been in this situation before and quite frankly i think its a bit disrespectful because they were initially trying to build a friendship and then they tried to take advantage of my business, also i charge incredibly low due to everyones current situation so theres that. you wouldnt go to a grocery store and tell the cashier that youll teach them jujitsu in exchange for the groceries. i dont understand how some people can be so bold. how do i tell this person no in a professional manner?

how does it work?	i'm curious to know how the economy works, how currency functions, counterfeiting etc., most people refer to the ray dalio video and proceed to say small transactions at whole form the economy. i do understand that's the simplest one can say. however, that answer proceed to pinge more questions. on what basis does a central bank determine the currency notes to print. which inturn leads me to find about the fractional reserve banking and credit creation theory and private shareholders of central banks aka rothschilds. kindly clear up the fog all for once. and direct me to some worthwhile resources that possess the ability to make sense of the world instead of making it further complicated with unnecesary and unasked jargon. fun fact during the second world war, 1/3rd of the u.s. dollar in circulation was forged by germany so as to weaken the u.s. economy. so, i do get it that in the grand scheme of things if we counterfeit or not, doesn't matter. our ancestors have already done all sorts of shady shit imaginable except nuking each other. thank you	Yaqoob_	/r/business/comments/jetnho/how_does_it_work/	2	1	0	0.6	1603213216.0

small business - how do you close the information gap when clients submit an rfq?	hi everyone, im currently working on a small engineering team of six people. were relatively new in the space but we do a lot of fixes/builds for companies in our area. recently, weve been getting a lot more rfqs in and have responded with some solid proposals. our proposals have great templates we can use for different scenarios, though, weve noticed there is an information gap between what we are given by the client company and what we find out along the course of the project. this frequently causes rework to happen during project cases and were looking to eliminate this issue. ideally, we would like to standardize the intake process so we are missing as little information as possible at project start. we are not facing an issue with winning the bid, rather, we are missing needed information that may not have been included in their schematics/our questions which is causing the rework to happen. however, we are the service company, so we dont want to hand out forms for clients to fill out and we definitely dont want to come off as less-than-capable when asking for tons of extra information. we know it really depends on the customer as to how helpful they will be, however, because we are newer to the space, we are getting project request that we havent done in the past that leave us with a lot of uncertainty. if you, yourself, work for an engineering company or have experience with this, it would be awesome if youd offer suggestions. karma coming your way if you do!! again, during the rfq /proposal submission process, we are looking to close this information gap as much as possible so that we can work more efficiently and effectively, with less uncertainty. thank you so much, trevor	trevormcmahon	/r/business/comments/jkkm10/small_business_how_do_you_close_the_information/	2	1	0	1.0	1604011431.0

looking for advice, ideas and tips on how to disprove false customer complaints about product quality, incomplete orders, etc.	firstly, i apologise if my post doesn't fit here but i have been doing hours of research in the past few days and found nothing specific to my situation, so this page seemed the most appropriate for the advice im looking for. . secondly, i will try to shorten this post to the best of my abilities and i thank, in advance, everyone who will take their time to read through the end. i work at a company that manufactures high quality children's transportation toys, ranging from simple push strollers to scooters. customers can start with a basic package and then choose between a wide arrange of add ons aswell as purchasing a complete set. in any case, we provide all the necessary parts, include a detailed manual, a 24h customer support contact and it is up to the customer to assemble the product themselves. i'm guite new to this company but it has recently come to my attention that we have no system developed to protect ourselves from false customer complaints, ranging from product quality to missing parts and the list qoes on. i'll give an example each box of add ons or complete sets is assembled on a production line with no fewer than 5 people, each of whom double checks for missing or broken parts and a person at the end, who's sole responsibility is to check that the box is complete and has been assembled correctly, after which it is sealed with a company logo sticker. this means each box goes through at least 6 pairs of highly trained, attentive eyes. i can't claim mistakes don't happen but they are kept to an absolute minimum. a few days ago we received a customer complaint, claiming that a set of add ons was missing 2 major components . both components are roughly the size of a dinner plate, meaning the chances of 6 experienced workers forgetting to include them is pretty much zero. but since its our word against the clients, of course we apologised and sent them the missing parts on our cost. example number 2 one of the add ons we offer is a set that includes a motor, battery, charger, throttle and a number of other parts. assembling a motor is a job that requires absolute precision, is costly and is the most time consuming job at our production. myself and another colleague are the only two who have been specifically trained to handle this item. in comes a customer who has now complained for the third time that their motor arrived incomplete. the first time it was supposedly missing 2 outlets, the second time they said it came without the on/off button. now i'm not claiming that i'm perfect and never make mistakes but it is pretty much impossible forgetting to include these outlets because they connect to everything else inside the motor. same goes for the on/off button. we did ask for a photo of the motor as proof, but to be honest anyone who knows how to use a drilling machine can just take out the 8 screws that hold together the motors outer shell, remove the 2 outlets and thats it. again, the customers word against ours so they have now received already the third motor . so finally here are my questions what options do we have, in what ways can we protect ourselves from these kind of situations? how do we obtain proof that a certain set box is complete, before it is shipped to a customer to prevent these kind of false claims? one idea was weighing each set box another was asking the customer to post back the entire set box in its original form, so it can be assessed, fixed and shipped back with no extra costs to the customer. i believe to the most part, if the customer is lying, they will not take things further in that case. im asking for ideas, advice, basically anything that could help a business protect itself from false customer accusations. i thank you for taking the time to read this long post and appreciate every single reply.	katzefura	/r/business/comments/jpm9rz/looking_for_advice_ideas_and_tips_on_how_to/	4	1	0	0.6	1604731790.0

what do you call the person/company who take care of funding or grants for business startups?	i'm working on a particular video games technology, aimed at an audio breakthrough for blind and impaired vision players. in order to hire the right professionals, i will require funding. this is a business, but the focus is on the cause of improving the lives of an underserved demographic. there are a number of grants that can support the development, there are investors, there are funds, there is this and that. there are video games dev grants, as well as grants to improve the lives of the underserved. what i'm looking for is someone who will do this on a commission, meaning that their salary will come through once the money comes through, paying that person first, the creators of the technology second and myself third if the accumulated amounts can handle that. i did this for a short film years ago, where i sought a little bit here and there from large companies and managed to get everything we needed. this time around, i want this handled by a real professional who both understands the process in today's age, the legal stuff, can negotiate & sell and is driven by commission. due to the nature of the project, the money can be both public and private, so i'm not sure at this moment if i'm looking for a grant specialist, fundraiser, investments specialist or some combination of the three. what is the job title/business type that i'm looking for? thank you for your time and may your success shine bright!		/r/business/comments/ju1a8p/what_do_you_call_the_personcompany_who_take_care/	8	0	0	0.33	1605357242.0

businesses are the main sources of distribution of many services and products and are also key for boosting the economy of a nation. so how come businessmen are always portrayed as machiavellian or unhuman in many forms of fiction and media?	i am not a businessman, and neither am i adept in economics or business. i have a very vague but a bit understandable knowledge about how a business is made and why it works in terms of economy, society and so on, even though even capitalism has its many disadvantages and history of exploitation of many kinds which is how laws and rights that support workers are made. i encountered this video this is similar to the portrayal of a politician in media in general - maliciously charming and charismatic and a visionary but apathetic, machiavellian and even selfish. i internalized the idea that politicians are maliciously charming but apathetic, care more about using their words instead of their brains, empty promises and only care about themselves. while this is definitely true in some areas and politicians can be very utilitarian and selfish and stubborn in order to let their agendas to be fulfilled but judging by the hundreds or even thousands of politicians that are out there, it is impossible to say that all of them are like that.	sammyjamez	/r/business/comments/jxqkwe/businesses_are_the_main_sources_of_distribution/	2	1	0	1.0	1605884589.0

high shipping costs from suppliers, how can i mitigate it?	hello there, pardon me if this is not the right subreddit to ask this type of a question. so i have found a niche market that can work out as the good dropshipping start of the store....buuut the problem is with the supplier. the products from this supplier are basically the same product but with a variety of colors and materials. the supplier products are generally low-end products costing an average of 20-30 from other retailers and there is a demand. the supplier asks for a high amount of fixed shipping cost fee of 25 per order making it difficult to hide the shipping costs in the retail cost entirely if not partially. it means that once i have received an order from one customer for that particular product color variety, i have to order from the supplier the customer product and lose money due to shipping or add a sensible amount of other products in the pro forma and get more out of one shipment than by ordering one product but lose more money from the rest of the products. this in result means that i need a large start capital to engage in this niche dropshipping business. and there is an unevenly distributed demand for the supplier products making it difficult to actually pinpoint the most demanded variety to somehow overcome the losses in the longterm. one idea that came to me is that i could assess a requirement of a minimum number of required orders in a week for supplier products, that i could order at the end of the week and avoid making customers long shipping times. the problem with this is that it is not guaranteed that i can come close to the number of orders to actually achieve this assessment at the current stage of the e-store. are there any tips, good practices, or models on how i can avoid or adopt the shipping costs without large investment? any help is appreciated!	showtek320	/r/business/comments/k1ebws/high_shipping_costs_from_suppliers_how_can_i/	3	2	0	0.63	1606393294.0

business is for young people - seeking career advice for the long term	my dad has always told me to pick a career in which i can specialize in something. he always pushed me to become a doctor, lawyer, teacher, or something like that because you become more valuable with time and experience. he is a businessman and has always been stressed out about his job security, saying that after turning 50 years old most companies will look for younger talent. im currently 25 and on a business career path. my fathers advice has always stuck with me, and sometimes i feel that business is a young persons job. im worried that once i get into my 50s and 60s ill be less valuable and will regret not going to law school, for example. im currently working in the sales/marketing world where most people really are younger. does this mean my future is at risk? im hoping to get your opinions and hear your experiences with long-term job security in the business world. which specialties are most and least at risk? is my fathers thinking way outdated? thanks in advance!	chrisgs31	/r/business/comments/k26xpl/business_is_for_young_people_seeking_career/	5	2	0	0.75	1606502505.0

behind the scenes detailing business advice	i own a mobile detailing business thats still in its first year, but is generating me some decent income. i have two vehicles and two employees that each take a vehicle each day to go out and detail. i give them each $15/hour and on a good day they work about 10 hours each and i get $1200 on sales leaving me about $900 after paying them. the business is ran out of my house so i can avoid paying rent. what im trying to do is eliminate myself as much as possible from the business. does anyone have experience doing something like this? basically all i do now is schedule appointments and talk to customers . i want to not have to do any of this anymore. is it a good idea to hire someone to work from home and be sort of like a secretary? the only problems i have with that when i do it myself i can answer questions and calls 24/7 and when i hire someone to do that theyll only have to do it within their working hours. im a college student with a newborn baby and i just want to have more time to study and spend with my girlfriend and son. another thing to consider is that i live in an area with brutal winters. detailing does slow down in the winter a little bit from my experience working as a detailed somewhere else, but im not sure how much. im in the process of insulating and heating my garage and ill be done with it in the next couple days. we still plan on doing mobile details, but only if customers have a garage for us to work in. for the customers who dont have the garage, we give them the option to drop off their vehicle or have us pick it up. i would love to hire someone to do all the behind the scenes, but i fear that it will be difficult to afford to pay another person if im not getting as much business throughout these coming winter months. on the other hand, it would be a perfect time to get someone trained in to learn how to handle this kind of stuff. there would also be a few more expenses mixed in if i were to do this. such as business phone and phone line for the secretary/manager. and not having someone able to answer calls and messages around the clock makes me nervous. i know i could still answer calls and messages after hours, but i really would just like to have time to spend with my family and study my major. any tips about running this business are greatly appreciated!

the communist manifesto was written as a critique against the exploitation of industrialised capitalism of the time. what measures have been made or can be made to safeguard against these possible exploitations?	i am not a business major so my knowledge in how business works is limited and my understanding of communism is that it delves more into the political and social element instead of just the economic/business side of things as a main theme of communism is the divide between the upper and lower classes and how those in the higher class get more benefits and profits than those in the lower classes and this exploit this that the lower classes never get a chance to catch up or are limited in their opportunities compared to the upper classes. &; there are still criticisms of capitalism today like the hyper-capitalism of america in the 80s and 90s, the opportunities that are limited for smaller businesses because of the free market, and there are claims that capitalism is still designed that favours the upper classes and the wealthy than the lower classes which still causes a lot of disparities between the two. &; and of course, every time a communist system was implemented, it did not work - it was implemented in a way that is a dictatorship and led to a lot of economic and social issues. &; so given that capitalism is far from a perfect system, what measures have been made to safeguard against the exploitations that the communist manifesto talks about and/or any other possible advantage that can be exploited in the workplace ? what other safeguards can still be done to counter the exploitations or the problems of capitalism that exist today?	sammyjamez	/r/business/comments/k3ae1x/the_communist_manifesto_was_written_as_a_critique/	1	4	0	0.74	1606660703.0

why quality service triumphs other dirty tricks in business	ray kroc was a phenomenal salesperson that built an empire. mcdonalds is one of the best-known brands in the world and is worth billions of dollars. mcdonald's owes most of its success to ray kroc and his business philosophy. fortunately, ray kroc has an autobiography that talks about his journey and business philosophy. in the book, ray kroc mentions how mcdonalds focused on delivering quality service and a superior experience rather than sending spies into other companies and trying to sabotage their operations. at the time, fast-food restaurants were known for sending spies into competitors to steal trade secrets and possibly even sabotage operations. this one time a mcdonald's franchise owner went to ray kroc complaining about the competition he experienced and asked ray kroc if he could send spies into the competitor. after listening to the franchise owner, ray kroc started lecturing him on how mcdonalds was going to focus on quality service and providing customers with superior service rather than fighting petty fights with competitors. despite this happening multiple times with other franchise owners, ray kroc did not compromise and held his ground. this helped mcdonalds' achieve success in the long term and prevail. this does not mean you should totally ignore competition, mcdonalds still had to engage with competition under certain circumstances. however, focusing on quality service rather than the competition does have its benefits. what do you guys think about this story, do you agree with ray kroc? why or why not? p.s check this youtube channel out for more content on business and success 	Desong_Productions	/r/business/comments/k4jo9r/why_quality_service_triumphs_other_dirty_tricks/	2	3	0	0.8	1606824540.0

i want to start a business from quarantine but need advice	me and my older cousin want to start a business. i'm not going to say what it is, but it's a recreation business that can't be done digitally and would have a massive market in washington dc. this specific thing surprisingly is not currently being done in washington dc, but is in places like new york city and some places over seas. due to covid-19, it's kind of put the project on hold. i want to know everything we could get done now from our homes, so that we can immediately get a head start to get this business up and running post covid-19 vaccine distribution. it wouldn't be a very cheap start up either	Geek_Voltage	/r/business/comments/k72344/i_want_to_start_a_business_from_quarantine_but/	4	1	0	0.66	1607147100.0
how to bring in a food chain to a small country.	my country is a small muslim asian country. mcdonalds, kfc and jollibee are the biggest food chains here, being the most popular and successful. i have this idea to bring in mexican food here in the future, seeing we lack diversity in our fast food and how the people here have started being more fond of mexican cuisine. speaking of our diversity, even the variety of japanese restaurants have only just started increasing and we so far have at least 5 different ones. so i would like to bring in more exciting food. but the question is, how? how would one bring in tacobell or chipotle? how did these other food chains even come to exist here? what processes must one go through to own one of these restaurants or have them in this country? i would like to know your thoughts.

how does this idea for a bar for kids restaurant sound?	i don't mean bar as in a place to sell alcohol to kids, i mean as in a place for kids to come after school and socialize over beverages and simple food. the lengthwise wall on one side would be lined up with booths, and across the room there'd be the counter with barstools. booths would get table service from wait staff. the drinks would be things like juice, smoothies, milkshakes, coffee, soda, mocktails, etc. the food would be simple to make stuff like hot dogs, cheeseburgers, saimin, musubis, pizza, nachos, soft pretzels, bowls of cereal, scrambled eggs and bacon, waffles, pancakes, chicken nuggets, lasagna, spaghetti, toast, club sandwiches, etc. there'd also be things like ice cream, cookies, cake, and cinnamon rolls available for dessert. nothing on the menu would cost more than $10-15. the place would be open from 9 30am to 8 00pm, with sundays being closed. from 4 00pm to 6 00pm, all drinks would be 10% off, and all food would be 20% off. there'd also be a membership that parents could sign their kids up for, or if you could sign up for yourself. for about $20-30 a month, you get a card that allows you to get 2 free food items and 2 free drinks every month , and 5 cents in spending credit for every $1 spent on food and drinks. this way, i can collect monthly fee for something that some people might forget to use, and i'd have a lot of people coming into redeem those free food and drinks, which would attract non-members into coming in and trying the place out. the main demographic for this place would be kids who'd come here to socialize with friends after school, so probably ages 7 to 15, and they get out of school at 2 00pm . a such, various extras would be provided to attract customers a tv constantly playing cartoons on nickelodeon, disney, cartoon network, or a movie on a dvd player. coin-operated pool and/or air hockey table skill crane a few multiplayer competitive arcade games, like street fighter or mario kart arcade. the secondary demographic would be parents and people working or running errands downtown who wanna stop by for breakfast or lunch, hence the 9 30am opening. i don't know what i'd do to entice parents though, and i'm aware that that's a key aspect. maybe i'd have a couple tables be reserved for adults 16 and over only, so the parents can all sit and chat while the kids sit together and hang out. i think a cool thing to do would be to hold tournaments on fridays once a month for pool, air hockey, or those arcade games. people could pay a $2 or $5 entry fee to join, and the entry fees would be split into 70% for first place, 20% for second place, and 10% for third place. that'd be a fun thing for people to come play and watch, and then i could sell food and drinks to them.	hunter-da-hammah1	/r/business/comments/k8xix0/how_does_this_idea_for_a_bar_for_kids_restaurant/	9	2	0	0.67	1607402162.0
how to be more productive	as aspiring entrepreneurs being productive is imperative. sometimes we have a lot of work to get through and diversions like social media distract us. that is why trying the pomodoro technique can help you, you basically work non-stop for 25 minutes and then take 5-minute breaks. you need to be hyper-focused on the task at hand for that time period. no checking messages, calls, social media, or anything else. after the 25 minutes, you take a break for 5 minutes and you continue doing that for the whole day. take a 5-minute break between every 25-minute work block. you can either use an app or website to do this for you or just use the timer on your phone for it. i hope this post has added value to you, let me know if you think this strategy is effective! p.s if you would like to receive more advice about work, business, and more check out my youtube channel for more!

advice on market niche for app where people pay per-minute to speak with someone	my stealth startup built a general purpose paid-calling app that can be applied to many use cases. i was wondering if i could get some advice on what target use cases or demographics i should be aiming for when we launch. here's how it works. a person can set their desired hourly rate for a phone call. this person gives out a 'call link', which is just a link that people can use to call them directly. the person placing the call enters their cc information before being able to place the call. the call goes through, the caller is billed per minute, and the person being called gets paid. that's more or less how it works. it seems like it'd be useful for consultants, tax advisors, lawyers, possibly doctors, but maybe there are some better more obvious use-cases that i'm missing. any thoughts/advice is most appreciated.	zumpoof	/r/business/comments/kdbn6y/advice_on_market_niche_for_app_where_people_pay/	13	1	0	0.66	1607995671.0

turning family farm into event venue advice	i'm looking for advice, maybe some sites to the legalities, etc. i've inherited the family farm. 100acres. no, i'm selling not any of it. currently living on one of the houses on the property. . i don't know anything about farming. i like the cows and horses cause they're cute. i don't want to sell the cows to the meat market like my family did in the past. what i do know is it's gorgeous out here. huge oak groves. lots of fields, etc. i've done photography out here for years and people tell me it's gorgeous as well. i would love to turn it an event venue. i have several idea for different parts of the property. 1 the field closest to the road is going to be where my husband's shop is and gun range. . 2 i would like a lot of the land to be used for weddings, or birthday parties, or other weekend events. 3 i'm going to keep some of the animals just because i like them so i'm thinking use that as a petting zoo to cater to kid parties 4 the back side of the place could very easily be used as an air soft or paintball arena. 5 i could easily run a summer camp weekdays during the summer . my husband would like to open a solar panel or hemp farm but there's already 2 solar farms in the area and we don't know anything about agriculture and i don't want to hire that many people an would like something i mainly deal with the legal aspects and cleaning it up. so my questions are where do i learn about the legal aspects of these things, would it be possible to do this many things since we have the room? or would it wayy to much? we are in a rural area, but there are several larger cities nearby that have clientele who look for these type things, and as far as kid parties and a summer camp there is a big need for that in this area, especially for local farm kids. neighbors wouldn't care as the houses nearby are family and the rest is bordered by farm land. no one would hear anything there would be no noise complaints. the closest event venue is about 40min away and they only offer a barn, no where for outdoor events, an no petting zoo. we do have nearby places to cater as well tldr i want to do a million things with large property owned . should i narrow it down? where do i find out about the laws, regulations, costs of license, etc. other than advertising what should i be looking at if i want this to be successful? does this sound like something that would succeed to you?	subbratkinky	/r/business/comments/khj1tr/turning_family_farm_into_event_venue_advice/	7	1	0	0.66	1608562973.0

how to split profits?	hi guys! hope you're all doing well. me and a friend are starting a bar and lounge, due to open in a few days, and i just wanted to know how we should split profit based on our current situation. would really appreciate any help here ! so i currently live in australia, and my friend who is my business partner lives in india. the bar is located in india too. we decided that we will both invest 50% each to get the business started, and, the profit split will be 60% for my business partner and 40% for myself. we decided this as he will be the one looking after all operations there from getting the venue setup, organising and managing the staff and bar and everything else. i can't do much as i am located here in australia, other than maybe look after the marketing side of things. in this case, will this be the right profit split? to add, my friend has had to put in extra money recently, as we went over board on our budget. currently, he's invested about 56%, and i've invested 44%. in this case, considering he's invested more so far, and, he's managing everything, will a 60/40 profit split still be appropriate? is there a method which should be used to calculate profit splits? would love to hear. thank you for reading and look forward to hearing everyones responses 	parvezs27	/r/business/comments/kis55g/how_to_split_profits/	3	2	0	0.67	1608726211.0

how do i get out of a verbal partnership with my father without a legal contract?	how do i get out of a verbal partnership with my father without a legal contract? back in june i decided to invest ~$18k into my family horse racing business, which my dad has run for over a decade. i had money saved up and rather than let it sit, i invested in a few horses as verbal partners with him and have done pretty well with it. problem is, as my dad, i did not think a legal contract would be necessary and the llc is under his name with the money being sent to his bank account by our trainer. well, me and my dad had a bit of a falling out recently and i need money to cover my living expenses and i am not interested in continuing the partnership. i am owed a little over $7k in profit right now and i would estimate that the half of the horses that i own are worth at least $25-30k. i am willing to let those investments ride out, i just do not want to invest any more. however, my dad says im either in or out and he is only willing to give me back the initial investment. im not legally savvy, but ive got to be getting the short end of the stick here. what do you guys think my realistic options would be? i dont want to completely lose out on my earnings, but i do recognize that my dad holds most of the leverage here. thoughts?

how am i protected from a lawsuit in a rental business?	so i have been asking in some forums and small business ideas and it seems it is impossible to be protected from a law suit. i just started a rental company business with my atv and dirtbikes, and currently store them in my back yard. they come to my house to pick it up, then drop it off essentially. this is my life line as there is nothing else i know how to do yet alone this is what is keeping me from being homeless. my small business. i currently just use a waiver that i am not responsible for any members getting hurt or your own negligence. they sign it, and move on. now i am looking to get insurance to protect my small business because i know someone getting hurt is bound to happen one day, and from what these people told me, my contract and waiver does not hold up in court and its pointless to have a waiver essentially. i had a person comment back, even if i have an llc and liability insurance, they can still come after me and wipe my business clean. i mean so what is the point of insurance? is it true it is impossible for me to be 100% protected? this business, i dont even make much money. but it is enough for me to live and put food on the table. honestly makes me just want to give it up and work minimum wage somewhere. i also had someone reply back that liability alone for this kind of businesses is very expensive, and almost not even worth it unless my revenue is high, which is not. they recommended that i should just give up the business because the risk is too high. it sounds very unmotivating to be honest and i feel like i should not continue if i am going to lose everything since i am not 100% protected in the event if someone gets hurt. what should i do?	ridewithwill	/r/business/comments/kqyj6a/how_am_i_protected_from_a_lawsuit_in_a_rental/	3	2	0	1.0	1609853588.0

why a website is important for small businesses?	 why a website is important for small businesses? &; there are several questions that come to our mind when we hear the word why a website. the very first question that comes to our mind is, why we need a website in the first place? if we want to reach out to the world and our customers, then it is important for us to have a website where we can promote and communicate with them. the reason why a website is important for small businesses is because it gives us the opportunity to reach out to our customers. &; many people do not know where to find information or to whom they can depend. this makes the customers not able to get the attention or the support they require from the small business owners. the website becomes the one place where you can provide the right information to the customers. when the information provided is correct and accurate, then the customers are able to get the necessary support they are looking for. &; it is not necessary to hire an expensive seo professional to help you promote your business. you can do it yourself! there are many ways to make your own website that is affordable for you. you need to plan and choose the content to put on the site. if the content is poor and not up to the mark, then the traffic you will receive will also be poor. &; reputation another question that people ask about the importance of having a website for small businesses is the impact it will have on your reputation. you can make sure that your reputation remains intact by creating a website for your small business. the main reason why a website is important for small business is that you will be able to reach out to more customers. by reaching out to more customers, you will be able to convince them to make a purchase or at least visit your website. &; engage with customers this is very important for any business, but especially for a small business. with a website, you will be able to keep in contact with your customers and understand their problems. this understanding will lead to customer loyalty and increased sales. customers are impressed when they find a well-organized website that has been designed by a small company. a small business website should have clear navigation and easy-to-follow links. your customers will appreciate the effort that has gone into making the site work. &; a website is a powerful marketing tool. it can build the reputation of a small business as an expert in its field. customers will feel comfortable spending money with a small business because it has credibility. the credibility and goodwill that a small business has built will be felt in the products and services it offers. many customers prefer doing business with a company that has been in business for a long period of time and that has a good reputation. &; for customers, having access to the internet is vital. with the availability of the internet, you will be able to reach customers from around the world. customers will feel less intimidated when dealing with a small business because the website is localized. customers who shop online also have the advantage of shopping at their leisure and thus they can compare prices and brands without being pressured by store clerks or representatives. &; conclusion a website is an important investment for a small business. not only does it help you communicate with your customers, but also allows you to expand your market and make more profits. a website will not only draw more customers but will also give you more visibility on the internet. this will not only help your small business but will also increase the popularity of the brand and the website will attract more customers, which means a boost for your sales.	rubel120	/r/business/comments/ksji0g/why_a_website_is_important_for_small_businesses/	6	1	0	1.0	1610044672.0
how do i ask to be moved to a different branch during promotion?	hello r/business, i am looking for insight and advice and appreciate your responses. soon, i will have a zoom interview for a much sought after promotion within my company. my company has 8 branches spread out through 5 states. theoretically, and under current circumstances, i am a shoe-in for the promotion. the company promotes from within and i am a clear choice for the job in my branch. i would, however, like to move to a branch in a much larger city 2hrs away. i am at a place in my life where i feel limited by my current city. im sure that citys branch will have people moving up as well however i do not know the details like how many people are interviewing and how many positions they need to fill. at my current branch i know their are several open positions that need to be filled, so again, i am not worried about getting the promotion for my current location. first i will let them know that i am committed to the company and want the position. my question is how do i let them know my preference is to be moved. do i bring it up during the interview? do i wait until july or august to say i want to move next year? is there any downside to letting them know my desire to move? i will be on my phone all day and try to respond as quickly as possible. thank you	moshquit0	/r/business/comments/ksjnke/how_do_i_ask_to_be_moved_to_a_different_branch/	2	1	0	1.0	1610045080.0
created an seo company, started strong, but lost in how to grow and scale.	hey everyone, i'm looking for some business guidance/advice, especially from those with any seo business experience. a bit of background, in may 2020, i started a small company focusing on seo, based out of canada. as i had no results to my name, i started doing work for basically nothing, just to get some reviews and results. i've been doing seo for my own sites for 4 years now and seen solid results - which is why i made the jump and created this business. in the first 3-4 months, i worked with around 15 clients and 5-6 of them turned into monthly clients. the last couple of months have been stagnated in closing new clients. i have much more confidence in myself and my results but havent been able to close any new clients in about 6 weeks. im in the middle of setting my monthly packages i offer at a rate where i earn decent money. ive talked to a handful of business coaches that want to take my monthly income 20k+. i dont want to jump to that level without being comfortable in my ability to get there. im honestly not too sure what im after in posting this, but im feeling a bit lost in it all and feel like im shooting blindly at how to get new clients, sell the value of the services i offer and basically how to create more of a predictable income, month to month. im really struggling in understanding how to market myself to get the higher ticket clients . i seem to attract those looking for cheap seo, and while i started out there, i want to look for those with bigger marketing budgets. anyone have any guidance, advice, resources, etc that helped them understand and be confident in their next moves? im up for investing some money, for sure. just kinda lost in where to go to get the advice thats going to help me grow steadily. thanks for any advice/help!	horizon-unknown	/r/business/comments/ksmb8q/created_an_seo_company_started_strong_but_lost_in/	12	4	0	1.0	1610052276.0

marketing and sales plan 	hello redditors! i recently opened a cargo company in the middle east. we load and offload containers from the middle east to the rest of the world. my current market is undetermined, we get the sale from any customer no matter where they are. our first year operating was phenomenal, and we even managed to record profit. i wanted to make a marketing and sales plan to expand our business. i am a management major by nature, which means i know so little about marketing and sales. i seem very lost whenever i try to formulate a sales plan or a marketing plan. what do you guys suggest i do in this situation?

bad experience when trying to start my first business, just wanted to share...	on new years eve, i paid a company to form my first llc and provide ra services. i wanted some privacy from my personal address becoming public record and receiving a bunch of junk mail as a result. i also didn't fully understand the implications of having my place of business be my home, because that seems like it would count as co-mingling, invalidating the liability protections i wanted in the first place. so i did what was suggested on the secretary of state website, and tons of seemingly credible sources found on google, i signed up for a virtual mailbox service. that went fine, they gave me the address so i used it for my formation. shortly afterwards, i discovered that to actually receive mail at the provided address, i had to get a usps form notarized. normally, that wouldn't be an issue. but i had to move to a new apartment unit due to renovations on the previous one, so my ca id's address doesn't match the proof of address document for my current unit. going to the dmv in my county is dangerous, daily cases of coronavirus have been climbing majorly since november. we are the strictest state lockdown as a result. i quickly reached out to the company and explained the issue. unfortunately, customer service was out of the office for 3 days. someone still submitted the documents to the secretary of state. i then filed a short form of cancellation as soon as it was active. that was submitted yesterday. now i have to file my initial/final tax return , even though i did no business with the llc. i am intimidated by this form, so i might now have to contact an professional to help guide through it. i forgot to mention, i'm low income. so low, in fact, that i don't typically have to file both my personal federal/state taxes. i survive by basically being a caretaker for my elderly, disabled father, while enrolled in college for computer science. i wanted this llc to have some liability protections for internet marketing of affiliate products. i can probably do this as a sole proprietor as long as i follow ftc guidelines. i feel discouraged from ever having my own business. it's hard to get going for someone that is trying to escape their circumstances by starting a successful business, and have the benefits of an llc. does that mean i will give up? no, but this experience sucked. maybe one day i will look back and be glad my first try was perilous, but for now i'm just frustrated.

advice for going into the family business?	my father has a medium sized business and ive been involved in some capacity throughout my life. the truth is im not too passionate about it and we dont get along too well so i never stuck around. i also hate the idea of being a daddys boy and not starting something on my own. long story short, the past 5 years ive completely separated myself and pursued my own passion. but the lifestyle isnt great and neither is the money, especially during a pandemic. so i am thinking about going back to the business. weve discussed it and hes already offered me to lead a certain branch of the business. but i hate the idea of being in my dads shadow and following him around like a little pet. i feel like a sell out. hes one of those men that impose, whose presence is felt etc etc. however, im not blind enough to see that there could be some valuable training he will impart on me and i love the idea of getting the business to a point where it more or less runs itself, consequently giving me freedom to pursue other projects and passions. anyone ever been in a similar situation? how do you make a business relationship with a strict, hard, tbh intimidating father, frictionless? thanks beforehand! tl;dr thinking about going into fathers business but hes the strictest, smartest guy i know and its gonna be miserable.

why do you think fun factory has become so sucky?	fun factory is an arcade chain based in my home state of hawaii. they used to be really good when i was little. you'd go in and buy tokens to fill your plastic cup , all games were only 2 tokens per play, and they'd give you tickets after you're done playing. then when you spent all your tokens, you'd take your tickets to the prize gallery and pick from all kinds of cool stuff like toys, electronics, art supplies, sports equipment, etc. i remember winning a watercolor paint set and a fishing pole there when i was little. but ever since they started using cards to store tokens and tickets digitally in late 2010, they've gone really far downhill. now, half the prizes are candy, and the other half is cheap pharmacy toys. gone are the days where you can bring something good home from fun factory. what tf? why can't they have decent prizes like they used to? also, the prize prices are ridiculous. you used to be able to get a single mini/fun size candy for 1-5 tickets. now you're lucky if you can get them for 10. also, the game prices have gotten really weird. now, instead of all games being 2 tokens per play , the amount varies between 4.4 and 9.8 tokens per play . why decimals? why not just have whole amounts? make it 5 tokens, or 10 tokens. all decimals do is make sure that you'll always have unused tokens left on your card at the end of a visit.	hunter-da-hammah1	/r/business/comments/kydi2v/why_do_you_think_fun_factory_has_become_so_sucky/	9	1	0	0.6	1610777571.0
why would a personal checking account not be allowed to link to a business checking account?	i have accounts at 4 banks. i know that's a mess. but due to the pandemic and not being able to set up certain kinds of accounts online, and the fact that i just started a new llc this month, it has to be this way. anyway, i got a bluevine business account recently for the llc. i tried to connect it to my capital one 360 personal account where my start up capital is sitting, so i could transfer it. it turns out co360 doesn't allow that! i got a generic error and a prompt to call them, so i did. all they said was we don't allow you to connect business accounts to personal accounts. what........the.......? this is not the case with any of my other personal bank accounts. my bank of america personal account connects to it no problem. same with my personal synchrony savings account. now i will have to transfer this money from my co360 account to my bank of america account to my blue vine account lol is this a security precaution? what is this benefiting or protecting? does anyone know?	angelhair0	/r/business/comments/kza1ry/why_would_a_personal_checking_account_not_be/	2	1	0	0.66	1610902759.0
how do i start a business online with a website and an app with no experience?	i literally just searched business so please let me know if there's a better place to ask this lol so i have a novel idea for a business im fairly sure will be successful. the only problem is that this will largely be a digitally based service as an app or website, and i have no relevant expertise and have no idea where to start, so please use small words and treat me like a fifth-grader haha. i'm looking for someone we can trust to make the app for us, but we feel like telling an app developer our idea doesnt stop them from going off and creating the business themselves, so i hope that you can understand the sensitive nature of this question, ie. im probably not going to give any specific details about the app/website itself. is there a possibility of writing a contract so whoever builds my app will be obligated to work solely with us? i feel like this is something i should have been able to easily find online, but so far i havent found anything useful/companies trying to sell us something demanding excessive amounts of money for dubious services. were also needing some general information on possibly getting business grants, patent lawyers, legal disclaimer authors, applying for a business license, and creating a way to process secure payments online. any help or advice is greatly appreciated. thank you 	rackjabbit_	/r/business/comments/kzi7oj/how_do_i_start_a_business_online_with_a_website/	3	1	0	0.66	1610927564.0

i still wonder why moviepass didn't work out	moviepass was trying to emulate something that has existed in france for a long time. the two large cinema companies here both offer passes with annual subscriptions , with unlimited movie screenings and no geographical limits - and it is highly successful and popular. they even offer discounts to theatres and operas, ability to watch movies at affiliated theatres across europe, among other subscriber benefits. this kind of model is so popular that there's similar subscription services for art-movies, small-theatres etc. given this, i wonder how moviepass could have sucked so much at modelling its business. i mean it's clear that they didn't invent this kind of service, they had a pretty solid business model to look at and study before setting up their own shop. sorry if this question has been asked before - i tried looking for it and couldn't find any suitable answers. genuinely interested in understanding what moviepass did so wrong.	drashya	/r/business/comments/kzv2yq/i_still_wonder_why_moviepass_didnt_work_out/	9	2	0	0.75	1610978133.0
how to approach conversation with boss about unhappiness with workload	hi all, not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this but i hope so! looking for advice on how to approach a conversation with my boss about my feelings about work. ever since i started at the company there have been ups and downs in workload. some days we work insane hours but then it's always compensated by the calmer days. ever since summer, it has been nonstop insanity and it doesn't feel like it's slowing down. i actually got a 20% raise, which is amazing, but i have now realized that the money isn't all of it. i'm so frequently burned out and stressed that i just am not enjoying my life. if i could be 100% candid i would say that i love this job but no matter how much i love it, me having a work life balance is key if i'm going to stay with the company. how can i communicate this in a non threatening way? i legitimately want to stay, i just would love to work 40 hours a week like a normal person.	shaesammy	/r/business/comments/l01r8i/how_to_approach_conversation_with_boss_about/	2	0	0	0.5	1610998121.0

how important is founder fit?	everyone talks about the importance of finding product-market fit, which i completely agree is important to at least build a scalable product. but what if you do not have the correct founding team to even build a product or even build a testable mvp? now before i get shot down, i think there are instances where founder-fit might not be relevant at all or rather an easier obstacle to cross due to the technologies and resources out there that can be leveraged. but i make a case for the scenarios where founder-fit might be a dealbreaker to even get a concept off the ground, or in the hands of your beta customers to get feedback. lets go back to pre-covid days. you are going out for dinner with a group of friends. there are 6 of you, the waiter takes you to your table and offers you the menu. you catch up with your friends, decide what you want to eat, and wait for the waiter to come back and take your order. the restaurant is quite busy and the waiter still hasnt come, but thats okay as you are having a great time hearing about your friends adventure volunteering in a school in brazil, that was within a drug cartels stronghold. the waiter finally comes, takes your order, you enjoy your mealand now fast forward to completing your meal and ready to pay so you can leave. the restaurant is still busy, and you continue to wait to settle the bill. a few minutes go by, then 5, then 10if only there was an easier way to pay so you could leave. that is the problem roundtwo hoped to solve automating payments in hospitality. you would be assigned a code for your table, the waiter would put your order into the backend system, and you can pay directly via the app, and leave when you were done. the aspiration was also to automate ordering from your table or ordering-ahead. our target market was anywhere from quick-service restaurants to mid/high-end full-service restaurants. we knew the problem was real, for both diners but also restaurants they worked on tight margins and table turns was important. roundtwo helped move that flow along. the opportunity was huge! the founding team though was an unfortunate mismatch. conscious how long this can be....but the rest of the essay is here link &; keen to hear from other people too, any stories you have or thoughts?

hiring managers, what would you do?	i am the executive director for a small non profit home for disabled adults. im currently interviewing candidates for the position of resident house manager. its not a big budget job however the pay is very competitive - it also includes living expenses. my conundrum is this. i have a candidate who looks great on paper, gave a very good first round phone interview despite some technical issues . i followed up for another round and to finish what couldnt be gathered in the first round bc of said technical issues. i asked for a zoom meeting trying to be flexible and because his phone connection was the issue first time around. made the appointment, connected with the candidate and it was if i woke him from a nap bc instead of just appearing on the screen, he rose up from what looked like a lying down position on the couch. his hair was a bit disheveled and he was wearing a tattered up hoodie. i politely asked him if he remembered we had an interview and he said yes - and we got to talking. however, he gave me a pretty good interview- surprised me to say the least. he had more experiences than he had listed on his resume, but is younger than what i want in a candidate for the responsibilities the job entails. however with some coaching, i felt that he had the energy and a lot of other life skills that made me feel like he could definitely be mentored. there is something about this person that i really liked, despite the second odd impression how will you manage others who need a lot of structure, attention, care, etc when i asked him about my quandary. however, this person also has a strong background in the area im looking for, just not the administration part. the candidate answered all my questions well, he had a lot of enthusiasm and energy- and i could tell even though he didnt exactly dress for it, he wanted it. when we talked about salary he was - i dont know how to put it - very humbled. he only wanted to make sure it was a living wage. i feel like hes worthy of the next step which would be an in person meeting with some more of the board members - im just afraid he will show up looking more like a starving college student than a potential job candidate. i dont expect him to wear a suit or go beyond his means - bc maybe he doesnt have the means. i just wonder if anyone else has had this experience and if so, what did you do? were your instincts on or off? can i coach him at all or would this be a no no? if its not, how would you say it so as not to insult him, but to encourage? even a pair of jeans and new plain white t shirt would be fine. i dont want to insult him - hes clearly got a lot to give, but i also know that i can be wrong - i could have a person who talks a good game - but it didnt seem that way. im a bit older, so i over think at times - and i am a bit self conscious about appearing put together so i ensure i always dress for the situation. i know that many things are different now in our work culture - but i would appreciate kind advice, thanks in advance.

how would i get a foothold on the open market?	hey guys! i hope that all of you are doing well. i've been a freelancing translator since about 2017. the pricing is extremely low on freelancer platforms, so i want to develop a customer base outside of my company website. in the past four years, i have been able to work on about 3600 projects for 1800 people around the globe. over 99% of my reviews have the highest rating, so people liked it a lot, i believe. out of all of those orders, about 97% were middlemen, though. people who are hired by agencies and then hire me to do the work for them. they make huge profits off of it while not knowing anything about the stuff they pretend to do and while not willing to do a single handshake even if you threaten to kill a relative. that is, of course, only illustrative! they really wouldn't do anything to help you out, even if their life would depend on it. also, they often have a kind of god complex, which makes it hard often, they are incredibly unprofessional, coming from a third world country , and therefore it is always questionable for his potential business partners if a guy from, say, pakistan is on a native level in german which also makes it harder for me. again, most people only ever buy once. and i am concerned about that fact. some middlemen ordered from me 90 times already, but what about those one-timers? maybe somewhere in the chain upwards towards the agency, someone decided that my work was deficient and chose not to work with my middleman again. it also happened that i received the same files from 3 different middlemen within a few days. i also heard of other translators that those people in the chain alter the work and make it worse. the direct feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but the big unknown beyond that is concerning. the platform doesn't allow me to contact anyone outside. they are running a chatbot that recognizes specific keywords in messages. if it is positive too often, the message is locked and forwarded to support, who decides to take action against me. and they are very militant about it. over the years, i collected about 400 company names i potentially worked for whenever i saw a logo in a document. the people who ordered me were paying a low price, but the actual company would still hire an agency. the prices on my company website are designed to be quite a lot cheaper than those big agencies. also, they are still 4 to 5 times as high as my current price situation, so that it would be a massive upgrade either way. also, what i think is a big plus on my side, is that agencies are a lot less transparent about who does the actual work while i would be working with the company first hand, and they are assured that the one they talk with is an expert in what he does. i tried to mail about 150 of those 200 companies before. mostly through a general contact email or a contact form. direct email addresses are kept a secret, as many of you will know. i saw a few techniques on how to get those internal addresses, but every time i try those combinations, i get the wrong email. so i am not having any success in getting in touch with the companies i worked with before. another pain point would be how to contact them. i mean i did the work for them, but they don't know that i did it. i could prove it by sending the work files from my archive, but i am terrified of getting sued. gdpr and stuff. and also, they might have an nda active with the agency, right? and then someone like me contacts them and tells them to have a look at their files. that could be risky. how else could i get their attention? as far as my website goes, it is pretty professional and has everything you could ask for. tos, privacy policy, german and english version with a little seo for the texts. i am also running some google ads but only limited to the german region since that is a limitation of my hosting web service, offering some additional marketing services. according to my wp statistics plugin, i am getting between 15-30 active visitors a day. this started about 3 weeks ago while the website is live since about october. none of them ever ended up using my contact form to send me a job request yet. however, only about a third or so of the visitors each day are sent to me by google. so i am also drawing some attention to my website from other sources, which is good. so far, i have only received one email from a baltic translation agency interested in cooperating with me. i wrote them back, but i have yet to receive an answer from them. but i guess that is another plus if someone from the baltics finds me if i am only running ads in germany so far. i have a deadline of april 2022 where my monthly costs will increase significantly since i am turning 30 and some benefits are taken away from me. until then, i need to get some consistency in orders from the website to make it. even 2-3 orders a month would make a huge difference already! it would be nice if you guys could point me in the right direction with a few of those challenges.

advice for a newcomer to the business world	so i've been running my own small business for 6-8 months. just finished my degree in marketing and knew a few people that needed help with their own businesses. i've really been enjoying doing it on the side of my full time role as i see every dollar i make as profit at this stage - since my overheads are nearly non-existent. i'm just wanting some general advice, about what to do with the money i know have sitting in my business account. it isn't much, as it is only a side hustle/very small business, but i feel like i should be doing something with it instead of letting it sit there doing nothing? should i be investing in something? basically want to maximize my potential income from this venture while i have the time to do so. any advice is greatly appreciated! i'm very new to this whole business thing.

please explain why dogecoin is going to the moon	i, basically financially illiterate, have now invested a few days to try to understand the gamestop-stock-thing. i think i get it now. a hedgefund lent way too much stocks they instantly sold that they now need to give back, but since a group of totally uncoordinated stocks-hobbyists decided to buy that stock and hold, the stock is now extremely expensive and the hedgefonds have no choice but to buy it back at any price at some point, leaving them in a slightly awkward position. the doge-coin thing though? that's just a lot of people collectively driving up a price, right? or is there some 5d chess going on here as well? such thanks in advance, wow!

low startup cost business advice please	im 19 and not in school right now and unemployed. i took a gap year and hopefully will start uni in fall. i come from a very poor family and i have been looking for jobs but havent found any yet. im starting to worry more because i need to support my mum and i know a minimum wage job wouldnt be enough anyways. im currently making ends meet by doing little things here and there like tutoring or babysitting for family, i dont consider this an actual job as its not stable or consistent. i have many business ideas but most of them need some money to start with which i dont have. im wondering what to do in the short term to garner enough money to later start a business. or a business model that doesnt require a lot of start up costs. do you have any suggestions? i also feel very lost sometimes because its hard to distinguish who to trust when it comes to business advice. especially on youtube. the only thing i can think of that will solve my immediate issue is digital products. i recently learnt more about these and it looks very promising. any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

i want to major in business but im worried...	im a freshmen in college atm, taking classes remotely. im undeclared and even though i like psychology and artistic things, i wanna make money and i actually came up with a business idea that im really passionate about and best of all, i could target rich clients. both my grandpa and my dad started their own business, both successful. i told my dad my business idea and he thinks its the best career path i can work towards because it has potential for growth and i can make more money. this means a lot coming from him because he makes $250k a year and he started his business in his basement with $500. im a little worried though if im capable of even doing this for a few reasons - im pretty sure i have adhd, i have a screening soon. either way, i experience a lot of executive dysfunction with school and other things i need to get done. for months of quarantine i told myself i would work towards my goals, but all ive done is sit around and waste time. inaction is my biggest struggle and im not sure if im cut out to start and run my own business. both my grandpa and my dad are grinders- they just grind and get s done meanwhile i can take months just to do a simple thing. - im not really the leader type. both my grandpa and my dad are very assertive people and they have no problem making decisions and being in charge. im the complete opposite . im definitely more submissive even though if i really have an idea, i can speak up but i hate bossing people around - im horrible at math. i hate math. my grandpa and my dad are both really good at understanding math, money, and numbers. im better at english class where i write essays and analyze books - also, since i go to an arts school, they dont have an actual business major. they have communications and economics so i guess i can just do economics. i can try and do the make your own major thing if theyll let me idk, im just worried about it. i guess i can just suck it up and force myself to work towards what i need but im worried that ill fail because im not the typical business type. be honest if you think this is a bad idea for me	coopersushi	/r/business/comments/lamz83/i_want_to_major_in_business_but_im_worried/	3	1	0	1.0	1612238696.0

a suggestion for restaurateurs	covid-19 has been bad for the restaurant business. we all know that, and we know it's a business that will spring back big as the pandemic subsides. here's a new and original concept that could be wildly self-promoting and will have an extremely loyal customer base. its not all rosy. there are serious hazards too. but this is a concept that needs to exist, and whoever creates it will be celebrated if they do it well. roughly 12% of the population cannot safely eat at restaurants because of food allergies. my daughter is one of them, as was one of her friends, and a few other people we know. these kids would love to be able to eat in restaurants without the fear of getting sick or dying. a kid in england with a milk allergy died when the friend chicken he was told was safe had actually been dipped in buttermilk as part of the battering process. people with celiac disease are given safe foods that were seasoned with soy sauce, which contains gluten and can make them sick for three weeks. people with peanut and shellfish allergies are especially at risk of cross-contamination from a busy kitchen. it's a big problem. fortunately, only 8 ingredients are responsible for more than 90% of all food allergies. it is possible to craft a pretty wide menu that excludes all these items -- i know, because i've done it for my own family. the allergens are fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat , soy, eggs, and dairy products. what can you make without those things? a lot of bbq, most mexican foods excluding cheese , grilled foods, pho , most country foods of europe the list goes on. i'm imaging a restaurant called all free signifying a kitchen completely free of the top 8 allergens. safe from cross-contamination. safe from ignorant servers. safe from line cooks who get too busy to wash their hands from one station to the next, expediters and servers who can't wash their hands between handling every plate, etc. it will be the only safe place for 12% of the population to eat at. they will be the regulars, and they will bring their friends, because the food is also authentic and good. the celiac community is large and well connected, as are other food-sensitive communities. word of mouth is the best kind of advertising. i imagine a lot of free press will follow. risks you will need food suppliers you trust. a contaminated shipment could kill one of your customers. employees will have to decontaminate at the start of a shift in case someone was sloppily eating sushi just before coming to work. butter is one of the allergens. it may be a challenge to make great mashed potatoes and a lot of other things without the use of butter. but i'm sure a clever cook can do it. most of the food will have to be prepared from scratch, in-house. pre-packaged foods are risky. formulas, methods and shared equipment can change without you knowing about it. the small minority of people allergic to things like corn, strawberries, etc. will feel left-out and may complain. this will need to be addressed somehow too. there are a lot of kids in the world who crave the restaurant experience but can't safely do it. for them, for their parents and friends who want to include them in celebrations and get-togethers, this needs to happen. if anyone would like to discuss, please contact me. 	tomorland	/r/business/comments/lbszvu/a_suggestion_for_restaurateurs/	2	3	0	1.0	1612373597.0

20 lessons from elon musk on how to win	while some of these lessons might seem obvious, applying them to our lives on a consistent basis requires constant reminders and a lifetime of practice. even elon musk probably breaks many of these rules himself. if we all adhered to the following 20 best practices on a regular basis, we'd possibly all be 10x more successful than wherever it is we are... 1. listen carefully to the critics to hear what they have to say, but dont always think that they happen to be right! musk when henry ford made cheap, reliable cars, people said, nah, whats wrong with a horse? that was a huge bet he made, and it worked. 2. dont continue doubling down on a solution that isnt working. the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. musk dont delude yourself into thinking somethings working when its not, or youre gonna get fixated on a bad solution. 3. make sure youre surrounded by people you enjoy being with of course, if it is within your control. if the workplace becomes toxic, leave it. or try to work with others on the team to develop a more pleasant work environment musk its very important to like the people you work with, otherwise life your job is gonna be quite miserable. 4. learn from the successes and failures of others. musk you have to say, well,why did it succeedwhere others did not? 5. think about solutions that are 10x better than anything else out there. a slight improvement is not good enough to achieve rapid adoption and behavior change. musk you shouldnt do things differently just because theyre different. they need to be better. 6. think about all the pieces of the puzzle and focus on each of the individual puzzle pieces without neglecting the others. this is an ongoing effort of personal tug of war between various priorities and your time. never forget that time is your most valuable asset. musk if youretrying to create a company, its like baking a cake. you have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion. 7. build the right team or join the right team ; its often much more important to achieving success than the product itself. musk starting and growing a business is as much about the innovation, drive, and determination of the people behind it as the product they sell. 8. ignore the resume. think about a teammates character as much, if not more, than their specific technical skills. musk my biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someones talent and not someones personality. i think it matters whether someone has a good heart. 9. be a good person; whether you think youre an example or not, you are, particularly in a work environment. many people watch and observe your behavior, even if youre not elon musk. be a shining example to your teammates and colleagues by following the simple golden rule of doing to others what you would want done to you. integrity matters. musk we have a strict no-assholes policy at spacex. 10. learn how to tolerate pain. a lot of pain. the short and medium-term horizons are often loaded with obstacles and landmines. beware of them, and attempt to step around or disarm the landmines wherever possible. if your leg is blown off, figuratively speaking, of course, realize that youre still alive and continue moving forward. learn, iterate, and do better the next time in avoiding those landmines or disarming them altogether. musk being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death. 11. pursue what makes you happy, not only in work, but outside work. try new hobbies. join new meetup groups. try learning a new skill. start a side-hustle project that youre passionate about that could someday become a great company. musk people shouldpursue what theyre passionate about. that will make them happier than pretty much anything else. 12. after carefully planning a course of action and deciding that youre going to do something, go all-in. pour 110% of your energy into achieving the carefully thought-out objective. musk what makes innovative thinking happen? i think its really a mindset. you have to decide. 13. if you believe strongly enough in something, pursue it. if things dont work out initially , dont abandon too quickly. see point 19 below. musk when something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor. 14. try to think positive, even when things are down and remind yourself of the old proverb this too shall pass. its often in pits of darkness that we can see light at the end of the tunnel. musk if you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. otherwise, its not. 15. listen to criticism. ask for feedback, including negative feedback. absorb it. learn from it. apply criticism that is relevant and discard the balance. musk really pay attention to negative feedbackand solicit it, particularly from friends. hardly anyone does that, and its incredibly helpful. 16. get stuff done that will have a lasting impact on your community, environment and the world . do it specifically to make a difference in the lives of those around you and the reward will be significant and generous in overall well-being, and might even bring financial success .musk i dont create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done. 17. do not spend your entire life thinking about ways things can fail. get out there and do it. if it doesnt work, iterate, and then try again. iterate again. and again. most people spend their days optimizing for every possible downside scenario. this obsessive down-size planning ties up mental resources to think creatively and outside of the box to get it done. you should of course analyze the problem or deal at hand and solicit input from others on downside scenarios. dont let perfection stand in the way of bringing something good to market. you can always make it better over time. a corollary to this rule for entrepreneurs is to make the product or idea real and tangible as fast as possible. this will help in the feedback loop process discussed in rule 15 earlier and 18 below. musk theres a tremendous bias against taking risks. everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering. 18. develop a core group of advisors who will serve as a key part of your constant feedback loop . this core group of trusted advisors could be close friends, family members or even members of your community who know you well enough to offer meaningful advice. reach out to these advisors often and consistently. musk i think its very important to have a feedback loop, where youre constantly thinking about what youve done and how you could be doing it better. 19. have grit. do not give up. most importantly, have patience. its one of the hardest lessons of an entrepreneur since entrepreneurs often want results quickly. musk persistence is very important. you should not give up unless you are forced to give up. 20. embrace change. getting cozy and comfortable is easy. sometimes its the right thing to do. but oftentimes, refusing to accept the inevitable change will stunt your own growth and path in life, whether in the personal or professional domain, and prevent you from achieving lasting success. musk some people dont like change, but you need toembrace change if the alternative is disaster.	henry_gindt	/r/business/comments/lhmyrd/20_lessons_from_elon_musk_on_how_to_win/	3	1	0	0.6	1613057127.0

case study $0-$110,000 in two weeks. ideas on advertising	 i just wanted to give some perspective on how we advertise and some good things to keep in mind for those of you who want to advertise but need some direction. although we own and operate a few businesses, this venture in consulting is also a startup technically. hope this helps give some insight into effective advertising. remember. there are only two important things in business having a good product/service, and getting people to see it. i hope you all enjoy my take on how to get people to see it! ive attached an imgur link to a photo of the data so you can see where the main traffic source is coming from and all that. who i am my name is stanford nix. on paper, im a typical wall street mba kinda guy. dual mba in finance and business intelligence/analysis. currently in process of getting a phd in behavioral economics. i work and own a small cap investment firm with my twin brother stephen. we are literally identical in everything we do and we probably have an unhealthy addiction to coffee. imagine having a pashion for what you do, and having someone who is quite literally a carbon copy of yourself, who also had the exact same passion. thats us. what i do i am a consumer behavior analysis advertising consultant. in a one-sentence answer i help people understand their consumer data, where they are getting traffic from, and help them scale their revenue through the analysis and application of behavioral economics. we do this by advanced modeling, and buy-side analytical algorithms to accurately predict sales. basically, we help people generate more revenue through effective advertising. the if you spend 1$ here, you'll make $3 back kind of advertising. super detailed and super helpful. how do i know what im doing? we have started 3 separate companies. all in house, and grown by us. millions of dollars in revenue later, we have started a new venture. a consulting agency that takes our applicable knowledge of operations and advertising, and puts them to work with our partners. its building another business like we have before under our holding company, but instead of products, is a cashflowing service. account managers, sales team, media team, the whole works. case study i wanted to give a little insight on our advertising strategy for a company we worked with recently. pretty straight forward. we consult on their entire business, with a focus on our specialty of consumer behavior analysis, that feeds into the advertising strategy. we pretty much were given free reign to do what we wanted. the client ran day-to-day operations and all we came on board to help with was the advertising and scaling. once their in-house team came up with the content and copy of what product they wanted to push, we started doing some research and model building on what audience is most suitable for advertising, based on a few data sets we gathered. this specific company had never done really any advertising before, ran a relatively small company and didnt have to much budget to work with, which is totally okay by the way. you dont need to allocate tens of thousands of dollars off the bat. our initial advertising strategy was pretty simple we started with 4 creative variants, which all were built around the data we had already. this can be tweaked how you best think, but stay decently close to your base. we used video. this is much better currently. no idea why. probably has something to do with more time on peoples phone. im sure there is a huge analysis on how much more people watch video during the shutdowns. whatever. we usually ask our clients to come up with a lot of different photos and video, so we can have a deposit of material to work with. the other thing with video is it lets us breakdown interest in the ad even further between groups of people who watched the video at different lengths . our initial ads were built around current situations. most people are stuck inside. so we played on that. this usually works best in the headline. they are pretty simple but straight to the point, you dont need to spend a lot of time on them. you can always change these in the future and they dont need to be long. in fact, make sure they arent long. heres a few examples for ya - stuck working out inside? get these product to make your quarantine more enjoyable do you have need/problem . then you definitely need product . the initial ads were as follows. // formula 1 // or benefit social proof benefit //formula 2 // benefit 1 benefit 2 benefit 3 benefit 4 // formula 3 // _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ once we got results from the ads, analyzed the data, we started to scale. our current form of scaling is what we like to call horizontal scaling, or shotgun scaling started by duplicating the ad sets 10-15x. each of these ad sets had a slightly different bid level. we bid from a low to high level and covered everything in between. for example bid level - 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,etc we were able to pinpoint the winning bid levels very quickly without much work. lets say your best-performing bid level was $12 to dial in even further, duplicate the ad set 3x and make the bid level $11.50, $12, $12.50. this allows us to create a perfect balance between cpa and delivery. the only step left is to raise the budgets! we then raised the budgets, and cut the ad sets that didnt work. and repeated! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ all of this was in 2 weeks. we had such good results, and tailored all the ad sets so specifically, that they went from $0 on this campaign, to $110,000 in two weeks. here is the data breakdown of traffic sources etc now obviously its not every day that a client comes to us and literally gives us a credit card to do what we want, but i thought it was an interesting case and wanted to share. keep in mind there are only two things that make up a business. only two having a good product/service, and getting people to see it. you cant force sales. and what we see a lot of the time, and the reason we started this business, is we see a lot of passionate business owners out there who have great products and services, but dont know how to show them properly. sorry for making this so long. ive had too much coffee today haha. stay safe out there and keep working hard! -stanford nix	TheMarginCaller	/r/business/comments/lkqvr2/case_study_0110000_in_two_weeks_ideas_on/	2	2	0	0.76	1613433847.0

how to split a fair amount of money at 18?	at the age of 18, most kids in the uk receive a sum around 1500 based on what the government gave them at birth and what other family members invested into the account. before i start, i should make it clear that me and my partner are planning to go away for a few days after covid which will cost me around 200. i am currently 17 and turning 18 later in the year, this amount of money is something i've never had anything near and i want to make sure i invest it responsibly, i've had several business plans which all require around 250 investment plus my time, i also have some experience trading paper accounts which are currently at a 10% return for the year, as investing can bring small profits for the sum of money i would be able to invest , i am unsure as to where to focus most of my money, my parents want me to save the full sum for university fees however they're still somewhat in denial that they're son doesn't want to spend 15k a year on university fees. is starting a business or investing at 18 a bad idea and should i ditch this and move towards getting a degree or is it worth focusing for a few years on building a business or portfolio i believe in ?	doritofeet23	/r/business/comments/lomwev/how_to_split_a_fair_amount_of_money_at_18/	3	1	0	1.0	1613874503.0

when you hit a roadblock on your entrepreneurial journey, who do you turn to?	as an entrepreneur, wearing too many hats and finding solutions to problems you've never dealt with before happens every day. it's almost inevitable at some point you'll feel overwhelmed, and that you have no one to turn to for advice. i mean, youre not necessarily going to call one of your investors or advisors to tell them youre overwhelmed especially if theyve invested in the company. that's why so many successful entrepreneurs turn to business coaching to help them clear their minds and push their business to the next milestone. a business coach provides you with someone to bounce ideas off, and can even help you avoid some million-dollar mistakes along the way. when it feels like the deck is stacked against you, having an experienced business coach to turn to can be an invaluable resource. in this interview, my team sat down with serial entrepreneur and business coach diane prince to talk about how a business coach can benefit you, and everything you should know before onboarding one 	MiguelSFelix	/r/business/comments/lqfo26/when_you_hit_a_roadblock_on_your_entrepreneurial/	1	1	0	1.0	1614077662.0

i want to start a plant nursery and am really good with plants, but don't have any idea how to run a business. where do i start?	i have always been really good with plants and gardening. now with the pandemic the popularity of the hobby has exploded. i invested a few hundred dollars of my stimulus turning half of my basement into a grow room and have run some test runs on growing different types of plants over the past few months and have now invested a couple hundred more dollars in seeds, different growing mediums, varieties of containers to sell the plants in, etc. now though as i am preparing my final test run and to start some of the plants i plan to sell at a larger size i realize i don't really have much of a plan. honestly i just turned 30 at the end of last year and said i am tired of sitting on my dreams and started. i figured i could sell my plants at a flea market/farmers market and that my selection would be vibrant and healthy enough to stand out. i also thought about setting up a yard sale, but with plants. i also thought about how if i plan to make more than a few dollars, which i do, i really need to get things in order. get a business license and form a business model. right now i am using many starter pots from the dollar store and amazon as well as name brand seeds. as i am planning on selling hundreds of plants is branding going to be an issue, or can i avoid that by properly labeling? i had ideas for my own brand but i worry about how to intermingles with major labels. could i write on the label something like burpee brand luffa plant, sold by a cool nursery name . do i need to inform/pay burpee or did i assume full control of the product when i bought the seeds? any tips or guidance would be great! kind of a side note, but i guess somewhat relevant. as i said i just turned 30. i've been a super hard worker my whole life and have kind of just been shit on where ever i work. i got a hard start, had to move out young and have just been living paycheck to paycheck my entire life. i was even homeless for a while after leaving a job that was literally causing me to have a mental breakdown. in being homeless i... got a taste of freedom i suppose you could say. now i've been stable, living with a roommate who took me in a few years ago. paying bills though not currently working . after all these years of jerk bosses and mean customers i just can't do it anymore. i've been a workhorse basically as long as i can remember. now i have super bad scoliosis, i've developed nearly crippling social anxiety and being real with myself, my looks are fading. all the things that made me valuable are leaving me and telling myself i can keep pushing just doesn't keep me going anymore. i've always been strong and charismatic but i'm just not really anymore. it's for real do or die. i could probably get disability if i went and got thoroughly examined by a doctor but that's also not what i want. i want to work and contribute. i just can't keep going the way have been though. so yeeeeah. if anyone could help me on the path to success i would be really grateful.

how should i go about the payment system for my small business?	hello! i run a little business where i create code for people's games in exchange for money. for a while this has been working out pretty well, however i have noticed one person in particular who keeps procrastinating about the payment after i did all the scripting for them. that made me wonder how should i handle the payments? should i ask to receive the money first and then do the scripting or do i do the scripting first and then receive the money? the thing about getting the money beforehand is that it may seem a little suspicious to the client, plus i'm afraid something will happen and i won't be able to fulfill their request. the payment method is a digital game currency and refunds are hard to give. but on the other hand, i could do the scripting first and then receive the money- however people may exploit that and get free code from me. any ideas?

any tips/advice on how to understand business? where to start in terms of learning the ins and outs?	i constantly feel so dumb because i feel like people have almost a natural understanding of these types of things regarding business, finance, even economy etc. i didnt finish school unfortunately but i have always wanted to learn. its just when i start i feel even dumber when people use beginner friendly terms and i still dont fully grasp the concept. the ways businesses run, the money and everything all seem like such a mystery to me. my biological dad was a gambler who now has his own business yet so i know its there in me somewhere but its like i dont have a natural business bone in my body. but i want to be successful, not feel lame and id like to branch out and create something bigger, finally get over the learning curve and i want to start my own thing. i want to be of service of people, i feel like its my role in life but something that doesnt come completely naturally. i have many fun, creative hobbies but throughout my entire life when it came to future career ive wondered if we were to enter a massive worldwide crisis what would be something useful for everyone. so i want to do something meaningful and purposeful. also just to note im learning to code too bc its fun but also i feel like it may come in handy. i know this isnt an emotional help sub and im not asking for that, im genuinely looking for ways to begin educating myself, i just dont know where to start. i appreciate any and all help.	glucozaaa	/r/business/comments/lt7u38/any_tipsadvice_on_how_to_understand_business/	3	2	0	1.0	1614373559.0

i want to buy a business in the uk	hi, a few months ago i was made redundant due to the current economic situation, i have a decent amount of personal savings and would be willing invest about 25k of my own money. my question is that with no income or previous experience and only my savings and the willingness to invest all of my time would i be able to get the investment needed from a bank or other investor to be able to buy a business if it has a reasonable track record with the idea of paying it back purely from the profits? at the moment it's just an alternative idea to finding a job where their isn't many. i've seen a few businesses that could be worth buying but i'm unsure if it's even possible for someone in my situation. any advice is appreciated so thanks in advance!	saturdaynightstoner	/r/business/comments/ltr51k/i_want_to_buy_a_business_in_the_uk/	2	1	0	1.0	1614441853.0

need advice for running business with friend	im 17, and me and my best friend since kindergarten started making butcher block cutting boards about a year ago. we sold a lot of boards, but never made much for ourselves due to always needing a new tool or equipment. at the beginning, we decided we would do it 50/50. but 50/50 turnt into me doing 80% of the work, acquiring 80% of sales, ect. i also bought almost all the equipment myself, and he would maybe put 100$ in once or twice when i bought equipment we actually needed that costs a total of around 1200$. we moved away from cutting boards and one of my other friends started selling items on amazon, and wanted us to make them for him. we decided to do it together, but this time i said 60/40. we used my building, my equipment, so i assumed he would have put in the same amount of effort as i did, or at least invest money into some equipment we didnt already have. that didnt happen, i designed every workbench/assembly line, i came up with the whole entire plan of how we will build this item the quickest, i invested another few thousand to get the equipment, i pretty much built and designed a majority of everything needed to start production. now, were on track to make 5-6 thousand a month. he wants literally every single bit of what he considers his, which he sees as exactly 40% of the profit. he has no desire whatsoever to invest anything back into the business to make production quicker, to work equally as hard as me. i could hire somebody for 8$ an hour and they would work harder than he does. i am so fucking frustrated and have no idea what to do. when i try and explain to him why we need to not take all the profit and put it in our pocket so we can buy more equipment and move onto making other products, his voice instantly drops, he gets very vocally aggressive and says 40% of profits are his money and he can do whatever he wants with it. i think he might have some sort of slight addiction to day trading. he says he needs the money for his trading account, but i never see him make actual profit. hes been trading for months now and every single dollar he acquires goes into the account. ill ask how much hes up overall, and he acts like he just doesnt know. everyone that trades knows how much they are up.

how we outsourced to 5 countries and what we learned	started in 1996 as a var in the crm sphere, we set to resell existing crm applications and deliver consulting services to implement and configure those tools. during the first 10 years, we tried multiple market segments to take on projects and deliver value through crm solutions. over time, the market trends have changed towards specializing our offerings and making them more industry-specific. this inspired us to switch our vertical strategy and turn from a professional services company to a firm that specializes in building products and supporting them with our consulting services. the chosen vertical was commercial real estate. it was the moment we aligned ourselves with the top platforms and began developing our own ready-to-use software products that helped both small and large brokerages in the cre sector. we thought we could carve off or separate a subset of our professional services talent to perform theproduct developmentbut found that current consulting project demands and revenue goals continued to pull resources off product development efforts. since then, we have started seeking a software partner outside the us to outsource and get valuable resource allocation. how did we begin our story? at that time, we have heard some stories about it outsourcing from our network partners and some of them had great success. we thought it would be useful to get initial best practices and learn some lessons before we kick-off. one particular networking partner had just released some software using a group in china and this is where the official journey for outsourcing began for ascendix. our first try outsourcing to china if we knew then what we know now, we would not have started in china. facts and stats about it outsourcing to china $15-$35 hourly developer rates 140,000+ software development companies 7+ mln technical specialists $1,2 trillion it market size to be short, the key advantages of offshoring to china are lower bill rates and cost savings. however, we also experienced huge language barriers, time zone difficulties, and inefficient communication. most work requests were handled via emails for the team to work on when they got into the office the next day. we greatly suffered from the lack of dynamic and synchronous conversations so that this workflow type led to much longer delivery timelines and software products not tight enough. to sum up, this partnership lasted around 5 months, and then we started our research on where to find a development partner with a much more overlapping time zone. it outsourcing to argentina we came across the concept of nearshoring which was a huge surprise for us after the previous issues. ultimately, we found a software development partner in argentina. &; here are the key facts about software development outsourcing to argentina $45-$65 hourly developer rates 114,000+ software developers in the it market 15,000+ technical graduates yearly $7.5+ billion it market size. not to be wordy, we have not experienced any of the previous challenges like the lack of dynamic meetings. whats more, we kicked our relationship off by inviting their key personnel to visit our offices in dallas. most likely, we would have continued our collaboration but an improving economy in argentina has forced us not to see those reasonable economic savings. this way, we were unable to grow our tech team there and improve on. our third try it outsourcing to india probably the most frequent software development outsourcing location now came to our minds at that time. we decided to give india a try. the core facts and stats about software development outsourcing to india 50% of indian developers have a salary level of $10,000/year 2+ mln app development jobs in 2021 being a crm consultancy for commercial real estate, we first paid our attention to a reputable company in india that had the same domain focus. it was only a matter of time before we started suffering from the time zone differences that negatively influenced our relationship. we needed some special accommodations to have 1-2 hours of overlap in business hours. predictably, the indian rates were lower than those in argentina, but we didnt expect the resources and product quality to be that much lower due to the lack of synchronous conversations on projects items. so, the overall experience was not that pleasant again, and we decided to change an it outsourcing provider. software development outsourcing to mexico as we had moderate experience with nearshoring, we decided to give a try one more and started looking for americas software development providers. this way, we came to mexico in the hope of a successful relationship. the key facts about it outsourcing to mexico $35-$55 average hourly developer rates 13,000+ technical graduates yearly 115,000 technical specialists in the it market. in a word, the cost structures were pretty competitive, though higher thanin india, but they still motivated us to try the nearshoringmodel. the delivered software product quality was up to the mark, but the relationshipseemed more robotic in nature where tasks were delivered once assigned but there was no strategic guidance, alternative solutions nor suggestions being provided. whats more, we bumped into a resource retention issue that negatively influenced the software deliveredand products quality started suffering from this. that time we concluded that we need more than just staff augmentation, but a strategic partner that could assist us in ideas evolvement and innovation at a more rapid pace. after manyyears of highs and lows with it outsourcing, we started to wonderif we were ever going to successfully deploy a team outside of the united states. why we selected ukraine as our offshore development center we were close to finishing our outsourcing strategy, but suddenly we received an email from a custom software development company in ukraine and they asked if we had ever thought of eastern europe as a great potential market for getting high-skilled staff at reasonable rates. during the first review call, we were completely surprised by the new nature of the feedback. we expected the default words like we need n resources for this project it will cost $k it will take y time to complete the project delivery. instead, we spent the first meeting identifying alternative solutions and challenges to our technical specifications provided. this slavic culture became one of the fundamental reasons to set up a new company office there. &; facts and stats about it outsourcing to ukraine $25-$45 hourly developer rates 75% of european countries outsource to ukraine 40,000+ new tech specialists yearly 1,000+ events for it specialists, startups, and investors every year 1 hour ahead of western europe, 7 hours ahead of the us . our 8-hour time zone difference leads to 3-4 hours of meeting time to handle discussions between both offices, clarify ideas,come up with new strategies, and make efficient decisions. that wasnt possible with the software development providers from india and china as we simply had larger time gaps. speaking about kharkiv, ukraine, we could say that the abundant talent pool with 10 institutions of higher education is a huge benefit that helped us decide to open a second office there. a major reason we selected kharkiv, ukraine is the abundant talent pool that exists in this city. kharkiv has no fewer than 10 institutions of higher learning that generate fresh minds and resources into the workforce on an annual basis. to summarize, we started as a pure developer office and have now become a cross-departmental ecosystem with operations,marketing, sales, hr, and recruitment talents. &; the key benefits of software development outsourcing surely, the key and cornerstone reason for it outsourcing is the cost compression benefit which pays you off both in the short and long run. the number two argument is extended development hours that allow us to expand the development life cycle.if organized well, development progress can be made while team members in other time zones are sleeping. third, a large talent pool is also a great benefit as you can find multiple professionals with a much more diversified set of technical skills. itsimply allows you to cover more clients demands and build all-around software products. ultimately, the resource turnover allowed us to find astrong allegiance with the resources in our kharkiv office translating into efficiencies from the continuity of work product. &; here are some additional advantages of it outsourcing increased organizational flexibility reduction in overhead in higher-cost geographies expanded ability to invest in market opportunities increased speed to market. software development outsourcing the key challenges let us be shorty and just list the primary challenges you may face while starting your software development outsourcing strategy language barriers cultural differences round-the-clock development . final thoughts software development outsourcing can become a creepy journey for those starting it for the first time. we hope our story of protracted ups and downs around the world will help you simplify and protect your business from potential risks and waste of time, resources, and motivation. we would be glad to answer any questions you have to start a meaningful discussion around this ambiguous business practice. if you want to read a full story, feel free to ping us out in the comments so that we can share the link.	ascendixtech	/r/business/comments/m5he3m/how_we_outsourced_to_5_countries_and_what_we/	6	6	0	0.88	1615802665.0

need advice on ecommerce start up!	hi guys! my dad is looking at getting into ecommerce selling fishing gear . he called me about a company called ecom capital. basically, they want $10k as an initial payment, which gets my dad started on shopify , marketing, and sourcing material. they help him get good prices on stock, and then they purchase the stock and take a 1% cut of all the stock that my dad purchases through them for the store. they also provide a set amount of coaching, and training in the first bit as he's getting set up. i couldn't find much information about ecom capital except their website, and i really don't want my dad ripped off if something goes south. it feels not super great in my gut, but i also don't have any experience in ecommerce startups. does anyone have any advice or insight on ecom capital or the same type of company? much appreciated.	merfester	/r/business/comments/mg79q8/need_advice_on_ecommerce_start_up/	5	1	0	1.0	1617076364.0

need advice on making my clothing line an official business, connecting it to a third party credit card processor	so me, and 2 of my good friends have started designing clothes, made a website, but we ran into a problem making a merchant account for a third party credit card processor that will make payments possible on our website. we are already done with everything else, our sample products will come in in a few days for quality testing, but we will need official documents that state that we are a legitimate business. i can legally make a company in my country, but i dont know exactly what information i will have to give to the third party credit card processor, and i dont know if it matters what type of company mine is.

behind the scenes of a small freelance businessour 2020 revenue, profits, challenges, and future plans 	every year, i like to share how our business has performed over the previous year and how that impacts on our business and personal finances. my hope is that being transparent about our revenue, expenses, profits, challenges, and plans is helpful to other small business owners. the aim is to &; share our business finances transparently, straight from our bookkeeping and tax returns. show that small businesses can create a reasonable income, even tiny ones like ours! inspire other people that you really can make money working for yourself, although its not the easiest thing. explain our challenges and plans, because im sure there are many commonalities with other small business owners. lets get into it. &; about us and the business myself and my wife run a freelance business, established in 2014 in north carolina. i provide freelance writing services and she provides freelance editing and proofreading services, directly to private clients and via the fiverr pro platform. were both in our late 40s, and had professional careers prior to becoming freelancers. weve used much of the experience gained there to run this business. our business is set up as a multi-member llc, currently taxed as a partnership, although i have applied for s corp filing status from this year. our clients are probably around 50% us-based, and 50% from elsewhere in the world. the business is 90%+ of our personal income, with the rest being dividends and capital gains. were financially stable, saving for retirement, and middle-class, without massive personal expenses this means were not planning to radically grow the business, just get some moderate growth year-over-year. in fact, as were getting older, were realizing that time and freedom are just as important as money in the bank. between 2016 and 2019, we managed to up our revenue each year, both due to taking on more work and raising rates. 2020, and the pandemic, stopped that trend. &; our business principles im a huge productivity / automation geek, so i try to optimize how our business runs as much as possible. this means being very on top of our daily operations, and also thinking about medium- to long-term changes we need to make. yes, it also means i love a spreadsheet. we never compete on price, but instead on providing as much value as possible to a client. so, our services are definitely in the more expensive range of freelancing, but we provide a ton of additional expertise, reliability, flexibility, professionalism, experience, etc. our services are all based around demonstrating that value and experience, which means knowing our audience and their problems, and providing high-touch, high-value solutionsbasically being fast, hassle-free, and keeping our promises. we openly publish prices on our business websites, so if a prospect contacts us, we know theyve looked at our prices and considered us in budget. that saves enormously on conversion, as all of our leads are warm / hot. we rely completely on inbound content marketing and seo. we dont apply for gigs, advertise, cold email, or anything else. partly because i dont want the expense or time overhead, and partly because as a freelance writercontent marketing should be all i need to doas thats the service im selling to clients. i have no desire to start or run a freelance agency! alright, lets get into the finances. &; our business revenue, expenses, and profits in 2020 ive shown our business finances below, rounded to the nearest $1,000. ive also included 2019 figures in brackets next to each, so you can see how they changed. any disparities are likely to be rounding errors. revenue in 2020 $125k vs. 2019 146k annual revenue from proofreading / editing $37k annual revenue from freelance writing $88k total annual revenue $125k revenue per day from writing $370 revenue per day from editing $155 total revenue per day $525 revenue thoughts we saw an overall reduction in income of around 15% , which, given covid and the terrible impact it had on so many businesses, means i think we were lucky. my freelance writing business took a fairly big hit from covid, reducing income by around 27% . two of my biggest clients were related to currency exchange and travel money, and they fell off the radar completely, probably resulting in about a 10% to 15% drop by themselves, with the remainder coming from cut marketing budgets elsewhere. the inbound marketing work i was doing for our editing business in 2019 and early 2020 paid off, with almost a 50% rise in income there. &; expenses in 2020 $21.2k vs. 2019 24k ive shown our business finances below, rounded to the nearest $100. ive also included 2019 figures in brackets next to each , so you can see how they changed. health insurance premiums $11.7k accounting fees $1.8k computer software and subscriptions etc $2.4k bank and credit card charges $1.6k office costs $1.5k business donations to charity $1.2k internet and phone $1k other expenses $2.1k total expenses $21.2k expense thoughts nothing surprising here, my accounting in 2020 was less complex than 2019, so reduced fees there. additionally, less revenue meant lower card processing and bank fees. expected, standard increases across other areas. in total, expenses accounted for around 17% of our revenue in 2020 , compared to 16% in 2019 . &; total profits in 2020 $104k vs 2019 $122k again, no surprises here. reduced revenue from covid resulted in lower profits. our pre-tax profit margin was 83% of revenue in 2020 vs. 84% in 2019. &; taxes in 2020 c. $27k vs 2019 c. $33k no surprises here. our overall tax burden in 2020 was 26% of profits, compared to 27% in 2019. it was 22% of revenue in 2020, vs. 23% in 2019. some of these taxes are applied to other income like capital gains and dividends, but the majority are from business income. the rule of thumb i use is to pay around 30% of profit in taxes as estimated taxes through the year, resulting in a small refund at tax time. that held true again this year i hope to get s corp tax election status for 2021, which should allow me to reduce my self-employment taxes by around $6k to $7k . &; take-home pay after expenses and taxes in 2020 $77k, 6.4k a month vs 2019 $89k, $7.5k a month our take-home pay fell by approx $12k net in 2020 vs. 2019. thats around a 15% decrease. &; monthly living expenses $4.5k a month in 2020 and 2019, $55k a year our monthly living expenses didnt really change at all between 2019 and 2020. any cost of living increases were offset by things like not going out to restaurants. we have paid off our mortgage and dont carry debt. we don't have kids, which significantly reduces our expenses. we do have emergency savings to cover six months of expenses. main expense items are groceries, utilities, property tax, pets, entertainment, etc. &; disposable income in 2020 $1.9k a month, 23k a year, vs 2019 $3.3k a month, $39k a year we spend 20% - 30% of this on charitable donations, larger projects, and fun stuff. 70% - 80% of this disposable income is invested over the medium- to long-term, mainly in retirement accounts. only 15 years away from retirement and need to build those funds up! &; financial summary ok, thats it for all of the finances. to summarize our annual 2020 figures business revenue $125k business expenses $21.2k business pre-tax profits $104k taxes $27k take-home pay $77k living expenses $55k disposable income $23k looking purely at the figures, my conclusion is that covid19 had an impact on our finances, but we were still able to stay ahead of our costs and maintain a good standard of living. &; heres how 2020 compared to 2019 our overall revenue decreased by $21k , around 15% yoy. our overall profits decreased by $18k , around 15% yoy. our take-home pay decreased by $12k , around 15% yoy. our disposable income fell by $16k , around 40% yoy. my thoughts for 2020, 2021, and beyond if theres one thing 2020 taught me, its that small businesses have to be prepared and adaptable. heres what i learned and what we are going to do diversify even more we were already pretty diversified with our client base prior to covid, but losing just two major clients put a sizable dent in our income. im focussing even more now on getting clients across a wider range of industries. maintain healthy savings we have six months of living and business expenses in ur bank accounts, and although we did need to dig into them a bit, having that money there significantly reduced our stress levels. keep contributing to longer-term investments we delayed our retirement contributions while our revenue was unsteady, but caught up towards the end of the year. the compounding effect is so important that i didnt want us to miss out. get government help i applied for an eidl loan when our revenue took a nosedive. ive repaid the loan since, but the short-term security that provided, together with the small grant, was still very helpful. automate wherever possible i want to save time, effort, and cognitive load so integrating all of our apps together lets me streamline that process, putting aside more time for paying work. focus on inbound marketing the months of may through june / july were very quiet. i completely rebuilt my freelance writing website to drive up organic search performance. it worked, and all of our inquiries are now 100% inbound, with around 20 writing-related keywords in the top 3 google results. previous work on our editing website means we have about 25 there in the top 3. focus on value, not price all of our rates are published openly on our websites, which isnt something that a lot of freelancers do. we find thats very helpful for pre-qualifying leads, and also sets an expectation for the quality of work a client can expect. i also rewrote all of our services pages to speak to how we can help clients and make their lives easier. in a time of covid, people already have so much cognitive overload, and what to hire experts that can make stuff happen, without much oversight, so that was a real value-add for our target audience . maintain independence over your work although we do get some work through the fiverr pro freelance platform, all other work is either through marketing agencies, or directly with clients. i find this level of control very helpful, as it means i can speak directly with clients. be exceptionally professional, but friendly at the same time we dont see ourselves as just freelancers but as running a business thats as professional as those we serve. that means being very flexible and reliable, responding rapidly to questions and communications, staying completely on top of work, and being friendly and hassle-free, and charging fair, transparent rates. emphasize proactive communications part of business professionalism is keeping clients informed, rather than them coming to us. that means weekly emails and updates on when work will be returned, checking in, and such. keep your pipeline full ive struggled with the balance between existing work commitments and taking on new clients. i could move to retainer contracts, so thats something im thinking about. as it happens, our revenue does vary a fair amount from month to month. help your professional community we all grow through sharing knowledge with our peers . it sharpens up your thinking, lets you see how other people are doing, optimizes your approach, and gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling! realize that at some point in life, freedom and time are as important as money im not sure when it happened, but ive grown to value independence over my work, and choosing to do only what i want to as equally important as earning money. now, thats probably because i have enough money, but chasing the dollar is no longer as important as it once was. play with dogs! because, yknow, working from home must have those benefits, right?! alright, i think thats it. thanks very much for sticking with me through this. im happy to expand on any of these points or answer any questions. over to you!	paul_caspian	/r/business/comments/mh98j0/behind_the_scenes_of_a_small_freelance/	2	7	0	1.0	1617206386.0

i want to open my own art business from home at 19. am i crazy for trying to make it happen?	hi everyone, i am 19 years old and have always dreamed of opening my own art business. i am perfectly okay with it not being a full on business at the moment, i would just want to sell art out of my apartment essentially. i've gotten into contact with local places about doing an internship or to see if they'd like to host any of my art in their galleries. i know a little bit of the inner workings of businesses from my father and i am a graphic arts major and business minor in my fully remote college. the lucky thing about my situation is i'm not having to pay rent and i can take my classes whenever i want. i already know a bit about graphic design and how to set up and code a website. i would like to get business cards in the near future as well as stickers with my art on it. i want to also sell commissions, art prints, and originals of my art. i think the main thing holding me back right now is my finances. i have 25 different artworks of different mediums that i can sell right now. my pricing ranges from $2-$300 for different items. i have a full-time remote job that i can also work whenever i want. in a day, i normally work and do schoolwork from 7am to 11am, then later 5pm to 7pm. i'm a pretty big night owl and would absolutely be able to manage 3 different things at once. i guess my real question is, how do i prepare myself to do something as big as this? i know i'll make mistakes along the way but i'm prepared for the consequences. another thing, i live with my boyfriend who is willing to support me, i have zero credit except on a authorized user card. i am looking into secure credit cards too. i live in a very art-centric area that would receive my art very well. i have 5 local businesses within walking distance that want to host my art. i have a local gallery that all they need me to do is submit a fee and then i am evaluated with a board of directors who decide if i should be in the gallery or not. i have a small presence on all social medias. my business name is only connected to my etsy . so far, i have been able to sell 3 commissions to people on facebook marketplace and i am waiting on 5 people to buy my original artworks . none of my originals are on hold for people, except one, because it is sentimental to me. as long as i get a print of it, i will be fine. if anyone has any questions just let me know! examples of my art are in my post history.	helpmeplease2023	/r/business/comments/mhmorw/i_want_to_open_my_own_art_business_from_home_at/	7	2	0	1.0	1617247980.0

how to set up a business with the future in mind?	hello, i want to start a furniture business - simply selling furniture. i want it to be online, and if it ever succeeds, maybe make a store. my problem is regarding the website. i don't know whether i should go for popular choices like wix, square space etc. as there are so many opinions on them. i'm sceptical of some of them as the platform which my site is built on, cannot be changed in the future, which is a problem because if my business succeeds, but the platform that my website is designed on needs certain improvements which the platform cannot provide, it will be a difficult situation which i want to avoid. i don't know much about building a site but if i have to learn to make one myself, from absolutely scratch, i'm up for the challenge. what's your advice and opinions? thanks 	OxyDoxy_	/r/business/comments/miodf7/how_to_set_up_a_business_with_the_future_in_mind/	11	2	0	1.0	1617382467.0

consumers are searching online but not buying. why?	 online marketers have seen the pattern 95%-98% of online visitors search for something, but the search never converts into a purchase and they leave the site without buying. it could be like when i shop online - will look at 6-7 places for what i want then choose a venue on price, delivery, and how to pay for it. i never only look at one website. possible flaw in the study. also the researchers list 2 solutions to encourage consumers to buy send a coupon or relentlessly track you through your browsing on other sites. coupons are not very useful. and since i never browse casually over websites then go offline to think about buying something; but buy while i am in the moment, the relentless ads that pop up for products already bought is annoying. maybe that is why i use search engines that do not track you. keeps the annoyance levels down.	limestone2u	/r/business/comments/mjtjkl/consumers_are_searching_online_but_not_buying_why/	2	4	0	0.75	1617531133.0

which major should i choose? mkt phd vs master in commercial law	hi, i'm a female student who wants to become a business consultant! i recently got an admission from a phd program in marketing.. the school doesn't hold a high ranking, but at least i could get a phd degree which will broaden the range of my future options. i didn't get full funding so i have to struggle to get a raship. the program is located in a cheaper region than in the us. the thing is that i'm also attracted to a masters program in commercial law. since this program structure is a little bit similar to that of a jd, it might be very helpful to understand how the business is like in that country. if my dream job is a business consultant, which major should i choose? the masters program costs more than 30,000 usd per year, so it costs my arms and legs.. i also worry that usually management consultant suffer from lots of overwork at nights.. i need your smart opinion!

how do i separate why private and work personalities?	i own and operate a delivery restaurant chain. business is very good and we have, thank god, actually seen an increase in sales during covid. of course, we follow strict hygiene and sanitary procedures. this is not the point of the post tho. i have always struggled to separate my private personality and my personality as the owner and operator of my company. i always forget where i am i tell jokes to my employees i tell them about my private life often really delicate matters to the people who have been working for me for a long time because i feel too comfortable around them. i often think nothing of it then lie awake at night thinking about how i shouldn't have said this or that or these were a very unprofessional thing for me to say and i will lose respect and authority because i tell private things to every and anyone. i feel like i let my employees too close to myself and i'm often unable to scold them or warn them when they do something wrong and they're beginning to take work less seriously because they know nothing will happen even if they don't give 100%. i can't change my personality from one day to another because they'll think i'm delusional. any advice on how to deal with this and to regain traction, authority, and command respect once again?	pb-v2	/r/business/comments/mwj8hl/how_do_i_separate_why_private_and_work/	4	1	0	0.67	1619138607.0
how do i separate a profit for my self as my business is starting to take off?	hey all im 17 and starting up a business and need some advice. my dad is a mechanic that owns his own mechanic shop and dealership as well. i have about 10 grand in cars that are up for sale. so i recently quit my daily job to start up a auto parts business. my dad last says has a bunch of parts and a bay in his warehouse for it. i have a lot of parts already up for sale on my ebay but also sell parts in person. id post the cars on facebook groups, marketplace, and offer up and then the client would come take out the part that they need. i recently have been selling quite a lot of parts. for example, i brought a old honda civic off of a friend and brought it for 340. i sold some mirrors interior parts and what not and made 400 the first day i had the car. 60 dollar profit in the first day right? the next day sold the motor and some other things and come up around 800. so i made lets say 1200 off the car so far and only payed 340 for that car. i have about 5k saved up for when i want to buy cars for parts or even a car to flip. now my question is how do i take the profit out for my self and keep my business growing? i have about $300 in my bank account but do have to pay for gas and food and what not. so do i put only the $340 back into my savings for cars and keep all the profit? i wouldnt think so because then i cant grow. do i take a weekly paycheck out for myself? some weeks i may not sell anything though. i appreciate all the advice you can throw my way even if its not about taking the profit out. thanks in advanced!	mikey00921	/r/business/comments/mxc7c4/how_do_i_separate_a_profit_for_my_self_as_my/	5	2	0	0.76	1619236739.0

how the situation in india affects companies these days?	the dire covid situation in india is really heartbreaking and i cross my fingers for them to get things under control as soon as possible. without undervaluing the human tragedy, it's impossible not to wonder about the extended business implications. many western organizations are often tempted to shift a significant portion of their workforce away from head office and clients' locations, offshore as a cost reduction measure. unfortunately, it seems that the situation in india isn't likely to be resolved any time soon, and some of these companies already experience unmanageable operational challenges, impacting their business continuity. during my career, i had the pleasure of working closely with some truly amazing, devoted and talented employees located overseas and i mean to say nothing negative regarding the quality and professionalism of the human capital in offshore countries. however, the current situation is proof that human capital ends up being only a single factor among many other factors that have to be considered. when i was a kid, i learned a great lesson - you always get what you pay for . operating away from your clients, in underdeveloped or geopolitically unstable countries brings significant operational risks which are often ignored by companies due to grid. boards and directors of affected companies, especially those targeting top dollar clients, should likely learn from this bitter experience, reconsider their approach and prioritize long term customer service quality and longevity, over quick financial gains.	samisusu	/r/business/comments/n0qc1s/how_the_situation_in_india_ranked_6th_world/	2	2	0	1.0	1619648330.0

struggling hard	i know this isnt exactly business related, but one of my stresses right now is trying to figure out what side hustle or business i can start. im 21 and i have a 2 year old son. my baby mother and i are not together and we have 50/50 custody. so lately ive been struggling so hard, i have no reliable baby sitter and i work 10 hour night shifts 4-6 days a week making $16.15/hr while going to school for nursing. when i come home my son wakes up about 3 hours after i get home from work so i usually only get like 3-4 hours a sleep everyday i have him. its extremely stressful and i feel like i have no one. im thinking about just giving up my custody to his mom but i doubt she would be ok with it because she loves to go clubbing and partying and she wouldnt be able to do that if she had full custody, also she has it way easier than me, her mom is her full time babysitter when she works. im not looking for anyone to feel bad for me but im looking for advice. my bills are about $1,200 a month and i make about $560 a week with no overtime but i usually try to take overtime and that adds an extra $200-350 per check. im so stressed that even when i have to chance to sleep i cant fall asleep. when i do take overtime i feel like im spending no time with my son so it always feels like a lose lose for me. my only debt is my $10,000 car note which im trying to pay off in 6-8 months.

what do i do next with my business	i've started a single person programming services business 2 years ago. i'm an experienced programmer and i create custom software for whatever use cases of my clients. i run it in a small central european country and all my clients are local. i think things are going quite well. i have like two major client companies that i work with continuously on the projects i've already developed for them and we also have future projects planned and i also have somewhat constant stream of smaller projects from other clients. it's getting pretty hard to deal with so much work alone, so i'm naturally thinking of hiring someone, because that was my plan after all, i never wanted to work alone, i always wanted to run a real small company . so i'm thinking maybe the time has come. i'm thinking of hiring two junior level programmers maybe half-time at first from september this year. i know it would require some investments for the start and some savings if things doesn't go that great in the beginning, but that's okay, i can afford that. i would love to delegate some programming work to other people and gradually shift to managing - that's my life dream. so could someone share their advice with me? what do i do now? should i hire? how many people? or should i continue to work alone until something happens? what should happen and what do i do then?	rokaskk	/r/business/comments/nd8xme/what_do_i_do_next_with_my_business/	2	3	0	0.8	1621114046.0

if you can go back in time to the early 2000s , what kind of business will you start?	hello everybody i wanted to ask this question because i reside in addis ababa, ethiopia. and the tech and startups situation here is like the early 2000s usa and europe. most of tech and startup fields are not yet filled. this was mainly due to our governments regulations. we only had one telecommunication provider , only domestic banks , one mobile payment app , and zero full ecommerce stores. another thing to add here is that , we only have ethiopian banks here that provide debit cards that only work on domestic atms and don't work on online websites. this means that 100% of ethiopians can't purchase anything from any website unless they have friends abroad . most of ecommerce is done on facebook and telegram groups. this week our government recently allowed the use of mobile online payments foreign telecommunication providers to start working. which in my view will explode online sells and ecommerce. along with this announcement formulated new legislations which heavily encouraged and provided incentives for startups and software companies. with a population of more than 120 millions there is huge untapped market for startups here. so taking 2021 ethiopia as early the 2000s usa what startup is profitable and rewarding? fintech? hosting services? movie streaming site? payment gateway platform? blockchain development? please any idea might help here,	Terrible_Fee8330	/r/business/comments/ndjbfq/if_you_can_go_back_in_time_to_the_early_2000s/	9	12	0	0.93	1621151596.0

what are some books or online resources explaining how to deal with the financial/banking/taxing aspects of running a small business in canada?	i have a canadian business and two clients, but i don't know how to learn about taxes, paying myself, writing off business expenses, etc. the truth is, i'm a worker who doesn't have the benefit of being officially an employee. so i started out by treating my income as just that... personal income. i didn't bother using my business account, i didn't write of any business expenses, and my groceries and rent came out of the same account as those business expenses . this is because i don't actually think of myself as a business, but instead as a worker who doesn't have the benefits that come from being an employee. i don't expect clarification or answers here, since it's a huge topic. i just want to know where i can read up on this stuff. and i live in canada so i need resources specific to our laws and practices. thanks very much!	pattmayne	/r/business/comments/nhqee7/what_are_some_books_or_online_resources/	4	6	0	1.0	1621597153.0

confused with ach payment	hi all, as a sole proprietator, i am slightly confused with ach payment. i understand it's a form of electronic transfer that utilized auto clearing system. but when i created a free account on veem to make vendor payment, it seems like the vendor must have an account on it as well. i thought ach works like wire transfer where recipient is able to receive payment by just providing aba routing and account number. do i always have to ask what specific ach merchant they use and use the same system? my chase checking account has option to send money via zelle , but it seems like it also requires the recipient to have signed up to use zelle. how does this work?	xkxwrdbboixkx	/r/business/comments/nsn85s/confused_with_ach_payment/	2	1	0	0.67	1622865890.0
how would i accomplish this?	good afternoon, i am wondering how i would create a type of card or membership fob to present to a bar owner as someone that has joined their exclusive online club. i am creating a website for a client and they wanted to incorporate some kind of after hours club where a person goes onto their website, signs up using their email for discounts, and somehow redeems them in the bar. i dont know how to make it possible for the customer to redeem it. they cant jsut walk in and give the bar owner a discount code from an email when it is untrackable on their pos system. the only idea i have is a punch card. but how do i as the digital partner make it possible for the physical bar partner to integrate this system? as well as make it possible to keep track of who has and has not signed up online? and that gets a punch card aside from me checking everyday, giving a list of the names to the bar partner and they check each persons id thats claiming to have signed up. how do i personalize each punch card to the person, so they cant keep getting punch cards every time a new employee comes in? thank you so much.

how much equity should i ask for given the details below?	im in the education industry and have built an impressive profile in the high school/college consultation business. currently i am bringing in 90-110k after tax operating as an independent contractor. a brick and mortar education company is in the process of expanding their market into the high school and college consultation business but do not have the experience, curriculum, or business model to branch into this market immediately. currently they are operating in multiple high volume cities and have connections with schools and other companies. they are also in the process of building an ed tech platform which i also have a wealth of ideas for. they have reached out to me inquiring about the possibility of partnering with me to build a flag ship service tailored to the high school and college consultation market. there is a possibility that i will operate as ceo or president of the company and they plan to leverage their current customers as a channel to bring in students. i will likely be the brains, management, and curriculum developer here, while they assist with the financial side of the business. i will likely also participate in the ed tech startup to offer my ideas and expertise in product development. if i anticipate the value of the branch that i will head to bring in north of 350k per year for the first year and a half then 500k+ in the second year, how much equity should i ask for? ballpark range of what would be appropriate and not off putting.

 is it too late to get into business? where should i start this summer?	i'm a rising senior in high school and getting a bit worried. i am not satisfied with where i am. next year, i am applying to colleges for a business major. my high school had a business elective and business ap classes like micro and macro economics. i haven't taken any because i decided to go for business just this year. i have a friend who plans to go for business but she is so set compared to me. she has taken the business elective for 3 years and has taken ap stat and will be taking ap micro. i am in a international studies elective and i have taken only english and social studies ap classes. next year i'll be taking ap psychology , ap gov, and ap lit. anyways i really wished i could've done more. i don't know anything about business right now. i don't really learn about stocks, taxes, economics, etc. i always wanted to do the marketing side of business not finance. this summer i'll be working in syep and taking intro to cs. i want to learn technology as it seems important in the modern day world. however, i should be really learning more about business before college. how can i start? any videos, books, courses you recommend that don't cost money? please if you know, thank you!

rich dad poor dad advice	hello, the question is a quick one. for the past few weeks i've been reading rich dad poor dad since so many have been recommending it to me. i've gotten to chapter 5 now and can't help but notice how much kiyosaki values accounting. he stress the importance of it and being a marketing major, i now feel conflicted. so my question is accounting really worth it in terms of building wealth, and using its skills in the real world. i'm not exactly trying to get into a crippling career that i hate though, that being said, should i consider a major switch?

a business-savvy marketer, wants to partner with a skilled worker - how do i approach this?	i'm looking for some advice on how to approach plumbers, electricians etc. with a partnership offer. by trade, i'm a marketer. now, 90% of times this type of businesses work quite archaically. these skilled workers make a living, but the service is subpar. no one is employing a crm for tracking and re-engaging the customers. they pour piles of money into very bad marketing, and companies are taking advantage of them. i can go on and on, on how fixing discrepancies could turn a one-man-show who makes good living, into an empire of employees. in general, i have a vision of joining forces with a skilled worker who just started his path in his trade and i want to take on the managing side of the business - scaling, finances, marketing, customer service, branding... this is not to say i'm going to manage him, or he'll be my employee, but rather we will work as partners. the question is, what would be considered good terms? how do i approach someone with such an offer? im asking this because its easy to feel ripped off when someone is telling you you go and bust your back in the field, ill be in my office. oh, and lets share profit! but, of course, there's much more to it than this. thanks.

what books, courses or maybe youtube videos exist on the topic of business communication and exploring business motivation, inclinations and incentives?	i'm a technical person at a point in my career where i have to work with people a lot. meetings, lunches, managing up and down, partnering up for side projects. i've been doing it way more over the last year and realized that it's much less clear cut than technologies. no whitepapers or oss, flow of information is implicit and interaction is sometimes more flaky and ambiguous than even going on a date with a 20-something girl. i'm not complaining, and in fact i find most people to be very reliable and open, but still there have been multiple situations when i didn't have a mental model of the situation and feel like i've dropped the ball compared to what i could've achieved. the question is open-ended, as i don't know what i don't know. but i have tried coming up with some some specific questions how to evaluate integrity and its limits? i guess it's a whole topic which is very important for me. how to understand somebody's motivations, explore the reasons, both conscious and psychological and align the goals of the project with them? how to maintain the business network in a natural way? what role do fashion and fads play in business networking, finding new partners and maintaining rapport with the existing ones? are there any discussions, guides on this? what frameworks exist for understanding behavior at meetings and at workplace? several times i've witnessed useless meetings going overtime or clearly present but covert competition. what are the natural types of abilities people possess, what are types of behavior? ideally, would love to have a neuroscientist's perspective on the brain chemistry responsible. i've noticed a clear line separating people's characters and their business abilities. is there any relationship between the character and dimensions of abilities or are they completely separate? it's almost as if there are two brains in some people, one is that of an average guy and the other is that of a cunning multi-million investor.	reggedtrex	/r/business/comments/nw0i7l/what_books_courses_or_maybe_youtube_videos_exist/	8	1	0	1.0	1623257490.0
what does it exactly mean to purchase a franchise?	off late i've heard the phrase '' purchase a franchise '' when it comes to options regarding starting a business. you can either start a business from scratch or you can purchase a franchise. but what do they really mean '' purchase a franchise ? i don't think they mean that you want to buy the entire chain right? like buy mcdonalds overnight and be able to change the logo to whatever you want? they just mean be able to start your own mcdonalds branch right? you don't own the entire company, you just own the branch. so why do they phrase it like '' purchase a franchise '' when you're not buying the franchise? also they say that when you purchase a franchise, you don't have an already existing customer base . but this doesn't make any sense to me. if you open up a mcdonalds, then won't people automatically flock to it because they know the brand? so don't you already have a customer base?

advice on a joint venture	my partner and a good friend of ours are planning to start their own cafe business. we are working out the fine details at the moment. but i cant seem to work out how do we split the profits in the end. both i, and the friends husband will be continuing our day jobs and wont be contributing our time to this business; i will be doing their accounts and taxations etc. some scenarios that we are looking at 1. both invest equal capital, and spend equal hours at the business, and share the profits 50-50. 2. my wife contributes 70% capital and spend 30% time, while the friend provided rest of the capital and takes on the 70% of time needed to run the business. 3. my wife just involves as an investor, where she provides capital, whatever is needed, and gets paid a return on the investment. how does one go about doing their calculations for scenarios 2 & 3. this will be our first venture into running something of our own. and i prefer not to get emotions in our way when making any decisions. any advice is greatly appreciated.

best way to manage finances when running multiple not-yet-incorporated businesses should i get a separate credit card for each online business?	i am working on about half a dozen online businesses. none of them incorporated yet as i am still testing for product market fit. currently all expenses are made on my personal bank account. expenses include domain name, hosting, branding, 3rd party subscriptions, etc. i have zero accounting background; never done bookkeeping in my life. it is proving to be quite a nightmare keeping track of my expenses by manually updating a spreadsheet and writing down which online business accrued which expense. the only alternative i can think of for the time being is to open a separate current account for each business on my personal account. but this would require a corresponding credit card for each account as otherwise i would only be able make payments by bank transfer each time - which isn't ideal due to transaction fees and the extra effort required in entering details.	lewz3000	/r/business/comments/o5ji4r/best_way_to_manage_finances_when_running_multiple/	3	1	0	1.0	1624356393.0
why sell in bundle?	hey guys, something i have seen time and time again is that businesses that sell in bundle tend to prosper. for example, during a time when software was being sold at $495, microsoft stepped in and sold its software in a bundled form at a price of $99. why do they sell at such steep prices, is it to get more customers which will make up the fluctuation?	mezway	/r/business/comments/o5xg3j/why_sell_in_bundle/	3	2	0	1.0	1624396406.0

how i made $100,000 by spending $0 on marketing	hey, get ready to read about one of the most casual yet groundbreaking marketing methods and how you can set up your own business without spending on marketing at all. introduction im a computer science student and i like to do web development. so i thought why not monetize this skill and see if i can earn by making websites for other people. as soon i thought of giving it a try, i thought of doing freelancing and went to one of the major freelancing platforms. created an account, bid on some freelance projects, and waited for any order to arrive. well to my disappointment i didn't get any order. okay after doing some introspecting i thought i should lower my price and see if that works. well as freelancing is already a saturated market, it has a lot of competition, and even after lowering my price, i didn't get any orders. i took a paper and wrote the merits and demerits of doing freelancing on a major platform and in the end demerits were more than merits. after getting to my conclusion, i decided to try out different alternatives and deactivated my freelance account. heres how iearned > instagram instagram is one of the most active social media platforms in the world. and when it comes to catching peoples eyeballs on your stuff, it is one of the best platforms. being a computer science student, i knew some people who were looking to set up a startup and i thought i should definitely pitch my work to them. so i messaged them on instagram. as they already knew me and had a sense of trust , they gave their startups website development project to me. and i build their website. they loved it and that's how i earned my first income from doing freelancing. > why my first order was the most important. because by completing this order, not only i earned some bucks from it but i also started a chain of my works recommendation and also gained the trust of the people i worked for. gaining trust is the best marketing possible. from there on, i researched to narrow down my targeting customers to whom im going to pitch my ideas. after identifying my audience, instead of just cold messaging them with my pitch i thought of continue reading the full article at 	karnxa	/r/business/comments/o7abiq/how_i_made_100000_by_spending_0_on_marketing/	5	0	0	0.5	1624569792.0

have a problem with business emails going to spam. need advice.	hello everyone, i am a ceo of a medium-sized company from overseas. we deal with airfare and constantly have to send emails to our customers with quotes, payment information, different types of confirmations, and so on. its only natural that sometimes our emails get sent into spam folders. we usually are able to call back the customer and make them check the spam folder, but during some time-sensitive moments, its sometimes impossible to reach the customer for one reason or the other. in this case, it may lead to a deal not being completed, and both sides lose time and money . we tried to make the templates as robust as possible, and it works to some extent, but due to the personalized nature of these emails, some of them inevitably get flagged for spam. recently my cto came up with a solution in the form of this service with emails. thanks in advance, and have a good day!

how serious a problem is american scientists/engineers being illiterate in chinese?	 edit some people seem to be arguing that american scientists and engineers don't need to learn how to read chinese . sure sounds wrong to me -- if this were true, why would anyone bother to learn any foreign language? &; about 200 years ago, the chinese government made teaching chinese to foreigners illegal. some westerners did of course manage to learn to speak but i would imagine the number of british who actually could read chinese was miniscule, like literally less than 100. it is of course very hard, probably no major written language is more difficult and as you might suspect, it goes far beyond memorizing characters although that is a very hard part -- it also requires becoming familiar with 4 character idioms although perhaps for technical papers this is not so important -- i just don't know; what i do know is i can't read anything that comes out of china but probably any chinese scientist or engineer can read everything published in english and/or can get a good translation. it seems to me we are probably facing the same problem today. whereas chinese engineers can read through american patents and scientists can read american journals, china can pretty much protect their important stuff simply by not allowing it to be translated. but i am not talking about anything sinister; the language gap i suspect means that the flow of ideas is very weighted in the direction towards china. the long-term effects will be devastating. maybe i am wrong; maybe many american scientists and engineers are literate in chinese -- i know that when i took mandarin 40 years ago, it was fairly new to the curriculum at a decent university . or am i wrong in that either china is producing no important papers or if they are, we can be sure they are being translated?

how should i brand my company?	i currently have a health and fitness company where i provide my clients a guide to a healthier lifestyle and help with weight loss and fitness goals. i also provide meal plans and fitness routines. they purchase either a digital guide or physical book copy of my guide. i originally started with a ketogenic eating plan. i have now completed a low carb plan and a vegan plan . however, i have not launched these two other items as i am unsure how to do it. i would like to be able to expand on my business in many areas of nutrition. the problem is, i originally branded under the keto guide, which i would like to keep. i am thinking about making that one part of a larger company, keeping each individual guide separate, yet making it apart of one company. for example, the keto guide by simplithrive . when doing this, i would have a separate landing page for each and would be marketing to different groups of people that my guides would cater to. the reason i want to do it this way is because people who are interested in a ketogenic plan, are not interested in a vegan plan and vice versa. i want to keep it separated so i can maximize my target audience and not scare them away with all these different guides. so my questions are do you think this would be a good idea? pros and cons of doing it this way? whats the best way to make this work with social media? do i have one social media page under the larger company name, or would i need to create and manage social media for each guide that would be advertised separately? is there another way for me to do this? any tips and advice?

want to sell profitable ebay business	hi everyone, so as a uni student i lost my part time job due to covid so i actively was seeking new ways to make money. long story short after losing alot of money and building up a network, i made an ebay store that makes over 50k in sales in the past 90 days . i never did any business course or anything like that so don't worry im not trying to sell you anything! i'm looking to invest in another start up which is an opportunity that might not come again, given my studies at uni too it's becoming too difficult to manage all three. to add, i can't hire someone without exposing my sources which is my strength! so coming to the conclusion a pay out might be the best solution, leading to my post wondering on experiences/advices in selling a business as such. i am aware that you have to go ways around it and cant sell an ebay store directly but honestly theirs so much potential here and i think someone who's after a second source of income or a uni student can actually make a killing. at the end of the day theirs money to be made here. &; thanks for reading and hoping i can learn of the comments etc!

have you ever said no to your boss? and what happened then?	context monday, i've returned from vacation and was reading an email from my colleague stating that she's been talking to my boss and they were thinking about switching the tasks. she would take over the ecommerce and i'd do the event advertising. i told her that this was a bad idea as i've invested the past months to bring our ecommerce shop to a level on which we can finally collect and work with data which allows us to make progress and optimization and that it was a bad idea to switch during the running process. if she takes over the progress will end right away. i've told my boss the same yet she tried to sell me the task of doing the events. i'm really pissed. my colleague had no valid point for this suggestion but saying that the guy leading ecommerce was in her team and it would be easier due to communication. besides i know my colleague is this type of guy that constantly tries to get rid of the stuff she doesn't wanna do but is trying to make someone else do it. i won't take her shit! also some months ago she didn't wanna take care of ecommerce so they asked me to do it, and i did, and now she wants to change back and my boss is even supporting it. so, i strongly intend to just say no to my boss, refuse and tell her to find someone else for it. i'm also ready to throw in my dismissal right away if necessary. i've had enough! what is your experience with a situation like that? have you ever refused? and what happened then?	mas707	/r/business/comments/os4flg/have_you_ever_said_no_to_your_boss_and_what/	19	16	0	0.93	1627322911.0

what do you think of this way to make extra profit during lockdown for restaurant owners?	myself and four other university students are attempting to help restaurants gain an extra source of revenue to stabilise income in these shaky covid-19 times. we have developed an altered business model that is founded on the covid-19 distancing protocols and so in theory should create profit. we would love to hear your opinion of our idea, because there are most likely many practical issues that only those working in the industry would know. our idea is this restaurant-style meal kits. similar to meal-kit delivery services such as hello fresh, individual restaurants will be packaging the essential ingredients and sauces of customer-favourite dishes into a meal kit, which they can cook at home. we believe there are 3 main points of value in this 1. customers can still enjoy restaurant-quality meals during lockdown without restaurants having to keep their kitchens at full capacity. 2. the meal-kits will be cheaper than the actual meals because the restaurant is saving costs on chefs wages and utility bills. this is a significant point of distinction between our idea and take-away. 3. there will be demand for these meal kits at launch compared to generic meal kits because customers have already eaten these dishes in the restaurant and they liked it. what do you think of this idea? is it practical? do you think it will be profitable? are there any key places where this could go wrong that you can foresee? we hope to modify and strengthen our idea based on your real-life experience in the restaurant industry. thank you for your time 	throwawaybae1291	/r/business/comments/oslosy/what_do_you_think_of_this_way_to_make_extra/	1	2	0	0.76	1627388166.0

why are uber drivers not classified as employees?	the irs.gov website states the general rule is that an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work , not what will be done and how it will be done. emphasis my own reference if this is the case, why are uber drivers, lyft drivers, and similar application service providers classified as independent contractors? the app tells the driver exactly where to go, who to pick up, what route to take, and what requirements must be met for their vehicle. perhaps the driver can deviate from the suggested route... but so can fedex and ups employees . in my opinion, its all just people playing the game... bending the semantics of the law to meet their fancy, and drawing lines in the sand. as a small business owner trying to draw my own lines, its clear that whats written isnt always whats enforced. everything is subjective, relative, and based on the contextual perspective of the enforcer.

 lighting business growth	i co-own a small lighting business , which basically sells high end lighting products. we sell both b2c and b2b, but the usual contracts are to other firms . we offer a huge range of products, some of them directly imported from china and re-sold at a premium, and others are bought in parts from different sellers and assembled in our hq. the business turns over approx. 1m / year, we have around 15 employees and we've been live for 10 years. the growth has been super slow, and just last year we broke the 1m barrier. i'm trying to expand the business, as we need more machinery to increase our product offerings, and a bigger warehouse, but i'm struggling to find a correct path of growth. also one of the things i'm trying to turn around is the lack of consistency on income. we do not have any line of business that returns moderately constant income, the vast majority of such income is based off contracts, which can provide 900k in one month and then absolutely nothing for the rest of the year. so, basically, i'm looking for new income sources, new possible products or markets to be able to increase the growth of the business. any ideas, tips or help would be hugely appreciated! thank you for your time &; edit added final question line	TheHarshPilash	/r/business/comments/ots13q/advice_lighting_business_growth/	2	2	0	1.0	1627540145.0

need some advice for a student fashion website	hi guys, i'm planning to launch an ecommerce website where i sell student-designed fashion brands aimed for the youth. just for a bit of context, i'm a student too and there are a number of fashion designers and students in my university with their own brands that have trouble finding customers. some of them have really good brands that are affordable, some of which i regularly purchase and wear myself, which i'd love to sell on my website. the only problem i have is with distribution and delivery. i'd love for the students to simply to create an account on my website and upload all their products, which when approved by an administrator will be available for sale, however, i don't know how to handle delivery if someone makes a purchase. i'm worried that if i leave the students responsible for delivery, too many things can go wrong. on the other hand, if i handle delivery myself or hire another company to do it, i will still need to pick up the items from the students every single time and i don't want to deal with that hassle either because students aren't always readily available. i have thought of a third option, where i take some stock from the students and keep it in a warehouse or a safe location for easy pickup but how will i convince the students to trust me with their stock? there has to be a way that makes pickup and delivery of stock from students easy and convenient. most important thing is for my customers to have a good experience on my website. delivery should be reliable. i don't trust students to handle it, and yes, i know i'm one too .

how would i go about this?	im looking into starting a local phone repair service focusing primarily on replacing broken iphone screens and dead batteries. i have worked out the logistics of purchasing inventory and setting prices but i dont have an intention nor the means to open a physical shop. i am a college student so im looking to do this more of as a side hustle. i have experience in fixing my own phones and phones of friends, of this which includes screen replacement and unlocking password locked phones. so in general, i am really confident in my abilities around an ios device. the problem remains that i dont have a physical store in which customers could visit, this to me seems like it could be an issue when attracting customers. how would i go about running this business? right now, i think driving to customers and fixing their phones from the inside of my car seems like the best option . although it can be quite uncomfortable. that is, unless i would be able to pick up their broken phones and come back to my apartment to fix, then later return their phone. but that option also presents a lot of problems in and of itself. i dont think that anyone would trust someone to take their phone from them to fix it to return later. what would be the best way to go about doing the servicing?	dponce1	/r/business/comments/ozl680/how_would_i_go_about_this/	6	2	0	1.0	1628304427.0
i have not experienced this in my life. what would you do?	this is completely insane, only me. so i started collecting sports cards on an auction site. i have been a member for a month. i believe that i spent around a few hundred dollars. there were two auctions that ended yesterday. one was paid for. one was declined by the bank. i was busy with my day job, and there was no way to look at my personal cell. i get a text from an auctioneer for 30 days from now for a tw card. he doesn't know me. we have not done business. he proceeds to send me the rudest text messages along with being harassed. i only said 5 sentences max. oh, i see that you don't pay your bills. pay your bills, and maybe we'll talk. i guess he could see that the bank red flagged me. this is because i was not able to see the email until 12 hours later. so that auctioneer went and wrote auction notes not to do business with me. i was writing a letter to the auction house, and i started to get rude and harassing messages at midnight. yes, midnight. i said, cool it dude. or you are getting reported to the bbb. he incriminated himself well. i can go well upon the bbb. i just am so mad, i wrote this at 1am. i am normally asleep. would you pursue this or let it go? &; &;	curvym99	/r/business/comments/ozndg1/i_have_not_experienced_this_in_my_life_what_would/	4	0	0	0.33	1628313751.0

19 y/o wanting to help dad run small trucking company - any advice appreciated	hey everyone. i'm 19 and my dad owns a small fleet of 5 trucks. i live about 6 hours away and im currently in visiting him and im leaving saturday. he does the mechanic work, paperwork and billing, basically everything. he does not drive any right now. i'm interested in helping him with the actual business side of the company, bookkeeping, responding to emails, handling a budget, etc. he doesn't do or know how to do any financial planning or anything like that, he's just been running trucks and once he finds a good driver keep them in it. i don't have any experience on the actual industry side of it, tho. today he was showing me his different accounts for fuel cards and stuff, how his bills are set up etc, and i know i'm fully capable of doing a lot of financial work. if i take over some of this work remotely for him, it would give him more time to focus on mechanic work and a work life balance. unfortunately, he is very stubborn and hates asking for help, so im trying to explain how i can better help him. does anyone especially small business owners have experience with this? as a small fleet owner or one man ceo i guess, what would be some useful things you could send off to do remotely. right now all i can think of is book keeping, budget planning, paying online bills, and keeping up with calendars or to do lists. we've discussed how if i came back home i could handle everything from the house while he drives another truck, but that's not an option for me right now. i really want to help him because his company has really started to grow and i'm scared the lack of financial knowledge and the fact i will own this one day will bring it all to come crashing down. i also would love the opportunity to do this on the side while i pursue other careers. if anyone has any advice or tips i'd greatly appreciate it.

do you think the global minimum tax will actually make a difference, or will countries and large companies will figure out a way to get around it? if so, how? is it just a headline thing that sounds cool but will have little impact?	for context as you probably have heard, 132 of 139 oecd countries have signed the global minimum corporate tax deal. pillar one will allow all countries to get a piece of tax income based on large multination business operations in their country. essentially, it tries to fight the digitalization of the world. pillar two will set the tax floor at 15% on companies' income . if a country doesn't tax at a 15 percent rate, it allows the domestic country to charge a top-up tax of up to 15 percent. it aims to stop profit shifting and should get governments an additional $150b. however, some countries still haven't signed the deal, such as ireland, estonia, hungary, kenya, nigeria, barbados, and the grenadines. if anyone is familiar with these countries' tax systems, could you comment on their decision?

why starting a business during a pandemic could be a good idea?	times we're going through now certainly bring doubts about whether it's worth starting a business now or waiting for better times. the worldwide pandemic that started in 2019 is now established in the current world and has its influence over every aspect of human life. the fact that entrepreneurs have seized the opportunity to start a business during the covid-19 pandemic, shows that individuals can capitalize on every situation. we'll share with you the advantages and opportunities that covid-19 brought to the entrepreneurship sector. in so doing, we didn't mean to deny the damage the virus has caused. what are the benefits? for sure, not every business can succeed during the recession - quite contrary. our intention isn't to romanticize the recession but to expose reasons why it could be beneficial to initiate a business right now. the main idea - a business should be relevant to have a promising start. under the relevance of start-up implies being up to the current challenges and offering a solution to make life easier. necessity brings invention innovation is the key to the solution people need during the downturn. the pandemic illustrates how creative humans are. such adaptability fascinates and encourages more and more people to start businesses. even though the idea you want to follow exists already, you can be innovative while delivering and developing your business. less competition it's kind of taking advantage out of disadvantage, but it's a fact that due to the sad story ends of many businesses, there's less competition on the market. whether you decide to make a good start for your idea or thinking of re-entering the market - it's the time. funding opportunities during the recession, funding becomes more accessible as interest rates become lower. it may sound illogical, but it's an excellent time to look for funding. also considering the current business environment, negotiating for lower cost and better conditions is more appropriate than ever. what are promising industries? tech tech or contactless tech is the primary field for investing at the time of the covid-19 pandemic. the virus affected human's perception of communication and interaction. as many shops and catering places went trading online, more and more potential opportunities appear. crypto it's unfair to say that covid-19 facilitated the rise of cryptocurrency businesses. better to say, so far, the pandemic didn't affect the crypto industry. the flow of time and tech progress strengthens cryptocurrency's position by natural causes. being 100% online-based industry, cryptocurrency is promising more than ever now. however, if you decide to build a crypto business, it's crucial to evaluate the risks and consult professionals. going online it businesses are still as relevant as they were during the past decades. furthermore, coronavirus compelled even no fans of technologies to use online services, thereby creating an absolute online necessity. when everything moves online, it's more than enterprising to invest in the 'online industry'. more likely, when the pandemic is over, the usage of machines continues to increase rather than decrease as humanity strives for comfort.	company_in_estonia	/r/business/comments/p5xvpp/why_starting_a_business_during_a_pandemic_could/	3	6	0	0.8	1629179737.0

advice on growing my small business	hey r/business, i run a small renovation business, owner operator at this point but i have an llc license. i have too much work to handle it all alone but a majority of it is net 30 so i struggle to save up capital when the turn around on these units is faster than their payments, even with material deposits that take up to 7 days. i want to hire bodies to take on more work, since at this point i have to push single family home jobs way out to accommodate all the apartment work or just flat out deny jobs. my issue is that i don't ever want my employees to experience delays in their pay due to the nature of net 30 payments. i want to always be a consistent source of income for my people. what are my options? what am i missing? if i refuse to start work before receiving deposits then i will lose the jobs to bigger companies that will start regardless. are there business loans i should get? any advice would be appreciated.

why do businesses in my industry charge separately for a two part service?	so recently i've had some success with my seo clients as many of them are receiving positive ranking improvements and some even appear on the first page; however, i've started to see many marketing companies pop up that only focus on one side of seo. that means they only do backlinking or they only touch up the internal parts of the website. now i've always been a big believer of packaging the two together as my seo process is a two part process with both internal and external work. i even include gmb in my seo work despite it being a different services. am i missing something or doing something wrong by including all of these in my seo services? the way i've always looked at it was a website that has internal seo with no external seo is like putting a beautiful new building in the middle of nowhere, or vice versa where you have all external seo and no internal seo is like the building being put in the middle of a busy area but the inside is nonexistent or terrible and nobody wants to enter. but that's just how i've seen it and maybe i'm wrong which is why i wanted to hear other peoples opinions.	jgillman824	/r/business/comments/p8cmg3/why_do_businesses_in_my_industry_charge/	8	9	0	1.0	1629489254.0

too many choices isnt always beneficiallooking for advice / help from anyone knowledgeable about scrum certifications.	i am looking to get my scrummaster certification but when i started looking into how, all i found was far too many options and nowhere that actually breaks down what the difference is between them all and what is the most beneficial in the workplace. do i go after the psm with scrum.org? or, do i go after the csm with scrum alliance? is one more recognized / valued in the business world over the other? is getting your scrum certification even valued enough that it's worth obtaining?	skydivesre	/r/business/comments/p8e5jt/too_many_choices_isnt_always_beneficiallooking/	2	1	0	1.0	1629494096.0

advice for a young man	hello everyone! i'm 20 years old. i dont have a degree, money or any experience or significant knowledge about business, yet i have convinced myself to becoming a businessman in the next few years by any means possible.do you think a business management degree at an educational institution is worth it? many people have said to me that its not worth it to pay that much money for such a weak degree and that i should give exams again in order to get into a university .the problem i have to pay money to learn the subjects i must give exams for from the beginning as i dont remember anything from school and if i get into the university i have to study and work for 4 years.yes i understand that the university will offer me much more knowledge but does that mean that a much weaker management degree can't give me the basic knowledge to become what i want? keep in mind that i don't really care about the degree's 'power' for finding a job as i plan on starting a business as soon as possible. i would really appreciate your opinions on this matter, if you have any question feel free to ask english is not my mother language sorry for any mistakes i might have made. thank you.	ontotita_x	/r/business/comments/p9motp/advice_for_a_young_man/	15	0	0	0.5	1629672033.0

conflicted interest - who should be loyal to who?	i work at a company, private, not listed. less than 10 shareholders. the ceo and founder has 60% of the shares. 30% is owned by an investor. the investor wanted to get out and sell the company and shares. the ceo was in it for the long game. my role was to help f&a with numbers and marketing material and sell the company. after a few offers on the company, it was clear that the ceo thought the offers were too low. so the interest of all parties went from getting a high evaluation to the ceo wanted a low evaluation in order to be able to buy out the investor as cheap as possible. in this case. who should be loyal to who? the ceo is loyal to himself but also has a duty to maximize the value for all shareholders. who should he be loyal to? my case makes it a little bit more confusing. i answer to the ceo who answers to the board who answers to the shareholders but i also got options and wanted a high evaluation. on the other hand, i wanted to be on good terms with the ceo who decided by salary, bonus, and future options. what would you do? edit i changed had to has to make the question more like the one i tased. this has already played out but i want to review my actions. what i did was quit. the situation was to stress full and my integrity did not like the situation i fased.

this might sound moronic, but has anyone ever tried a reverse sale ? where they temporarily increase prices due to high demand or something along those lines?	i'm fascinated by behavioral and consumer psychology, and the findings of experiments that show seemingly paradoxes in the way our minds work being more drawn to products that are way more expensive, things of that nature. you always see companies running sales, discounting prices to make people feel like they're going to miss out on a great deal. what i am wondering is has anyone ever experimented with the opposite? doing a reverse sale on their website for the weekend for example? where they don't just temporarily increase prices, but actively advertise and draw attention to the fact that they're doing so -- due to high demand, for example? it's something i think would be interesting to try just for the fuck of it. curious if any of y'all have beat me to the punch in your own businesses. thanks	What_The_Hex	/r/business/comments/pc8127/this_might_sound_moronic_but_has_anyone_ever/	5	10	0	0.77	1630010277.0

how would you split the shares?	i am starting up a rather unique venture and want to get around 6 directors which will start on a part time basis doing grunt work e.g. coo helping me with ... everything, cfo providing financial reports but not doing payroll, sales director calling potential clients him/herself. none will have a team at the start. i won't be able to pay them all for the first 6 or more months so i'm planning to instead offer a share allocation alongside a shareholder and vesting agreement. apart from the coo they can all do their min hours whenever each week, even at the weekend which means they can keep their day jobs easy enough. i can't decide what to offer though. my main concern is as soon as you lose that 51% you're immediately subject to politics. nobody expects to be kicked out of their own company, but it happens. i don't plan on looking for investors so i wouldn't need to worry about that. i'm currently thinking this, based on their initial time they'd need to put in but i don't know if it's deemed attractive me, ceo 51% coo 15% cio 12% cfo 5% csd 4% sd 8% md 5% am i being too generous or under generous? the coo and cio would need to commit to around 10-12 hours a week until paid. others between 3-6. advice please! cheers	dev_life	/r/business/comments/pcb0jn/how_would_you_split_the_shares/	4	1	0	1.0	1630019799.0

thinking about purchasing a business that fell into my lap, but need some advice	i am currently employed with a company as a systems engineer for a telecommunications company, i make decent wage, and i love what i do, but i was just offered a chance to purchase the company my father works for. he works for a carpet store that sells to builders, subcontractors, and homeowners. they also subcontract installers to install flooring for them. the company has been in business for over 20 years and seem to be fairly successful. the original owner passed away a few years ago, and his wife is looking to sell the company to someone who will continue to run it similar to how it is run now. it is a very family oriented company. my father wants to be apart of running the business but is getting older and does not really want the extra stress of owning the place. my parents used to own their own flooring company when i was a child so he and my mother both have experience with this type of business, and are willing to run the company basically as it runs today. i am going to be taking the current owner out to dinner to discuss things further within the next week or so. what are some things that i should remember to better prepare myself for the meeting? this is the first business i will have owned, so i want to make sure all things are in check before even thinking about pulling the trigger. i was going to ask for the last 5 years financial records including all overhead costs, rent for the building, employee wages, quarterly earnings, utility costs, etc. as a baseline to see what the company is actually profiting after it is all said and done. she has mentioned to my father that she is willing to let the company go for around 250k dollars, she only wants enough money to basically get her through the remainder of her life, she is very elderly, i would say in her upper 70s, and her step daughters want nothing to do with the business. what would the company need to be profiting yearly to make that $250k price tag worth it? also would it be feasible to keep my current job as long as i had a quality staff to keep the business running how it should? in the future i would love to own my current company, and have already been in talks with the current owner of my company now and he is looking to sell for around 5 million dollars. would owning the first company help me pursue buying another business? my last major concern is getting a loan to purchase the company. i do not have 250k dollars laying around to throw into this place if it is worth it, however i have a decent savings, and a great credit score. what kind of loan should i look into, and what advice can you give me to get me on the right track. thanks again everyone and i look forward to hearing what everyone has to say.

how important is email marketing in business? do you need a separate specialist for this?	i opened a small business a few months ago, nothing global - a small boutique of floristry and delivery of bouquets. after working as a florist for so many years, i decided it's time to start my own shop. &; the only emails i write to my clients are gratitude letters, thanking them for choosing our company and my best wishes. i did this myself without involving my smm specialist in the process. she didn't want to be responsible for this, in addition to her direct tasks saying that we need another person for email marketing. but my friend began to carp me, stating that i'm losing an excellent channel for making money and that i urgently need to start paying attention to this, or i'll lose clients. &; but let's be honest, it's one thing when you send an email to confirm an order or a few lines of thanks, and it's totally different when you spam customers with a constant reminder of yourself. it's very annoying. &; personally, it pisses me off that i have to waste time in the morning to clear my mailbox of various promotions and offers that don't interest me after i registered for some free webinar or ordered something on the internet. for example, it was enough to enter scribd just once, and for the second week, i receive letters from them with different proposals. i deliberately didn't unsubscribe to see how many letters they will send me. and i already regret my decision. &; i'm wondering how email marketing affects profits and if there is any ideal formula for the frequency of sending emails not forcing your customer to unsubscribe or add your address to spam. and do i need to hire someone to do this? or is it easier to add work to my copywriter ordering texts for the email newsletter and using services like or mailchimp? i'd be grateful for any advice. thanks in advance.

i wrote a business book about employee management and i was wondering if anybody would want a review copy ?	here is my preface which covers who i am, and what themes to expect from this book. why your employees hate you by rich e. cunningham. preface how would you like to learn exciting business secrets from one of the greatest business minds in the history of the world? i am a successful billionaire who lives a life of luxury, surrounded by false degenerate rich celebrity friends who you desperately wish would hang out with you. if only that was true! i am afraid that the biography above is slightly exaggerated. i am just someone who has been involved in business for most of his adult life. my father was a businessman of sorts, my mother was a business woman, and my grandfathers both ran businesses. running businesses, you could say, runs in my blood. but it hasnt always been an easy or simple thing. the very fact that none of the businesses my revered ancestors ran are still in existence should be a hint of the fickle nature of business in general. after an unremarkable childhood at school, i began my life as a humble employee at a local automotive business, mostly working in the office as that better aligned with my skills. over the course of my career, i have worked many jobs. some jobs were in the large corporate world of government and hospitals, but most were in small businesses. dealing with employees has always been a battle at the businesses i worked in. i saw managers and business owners struggle over and over with their underlings. there was no direction, no ten commandments brought down from the mountain to let people know what to do. that seemed normal to me at the time. i expected all businesses to run this way, struggling with the under tow, trying to come up for air once in a while and getting their employees to do some actual work. as i worked at different places, i saw different methods, and different ways of running a business or organization. sometimes the manager, close to retirement, would never come out of his office. it certainly made his life fairly easy, but the business didnt get much work done. another took a very active role in running the business and involved themselves in everything. this came with its own problems, as employees didnt know how to function without them. i ran into many managers over the years. but they all had their problems, idiosyncrasies and even valuable traits and i took note. later on, as my resume grew and i gained a few grey hairs, i became part of the management team. i was no longer just a casual observer to the struggle of business management. i had the chance to observe grown adults acting like children and had the fun of trying to correct them first hand. time after time, i was frustrated with the seemingly irresponsible behavior of employees under me. despite the business treating them fairly and not expecting much more than the basics, i was sometimes working in the wild west atmosphere of employees who flagrantly disregarded rules which put the business at risk. i must admit that initially i feared correcting employees when they were difficult. some of them were extremely hostile to anything resembling actual management. one special moment near and dear to my heart, is when two employees who had been working for the business before i became a manager, stormed into my office and said to me we dont want you to be here, just leave! this was after i had made the customer pay full price and had not allowed the paying cash special they had insisted upon. no doubt i had stopped the customer from giving them an under the table cash deal and ripping off the business and breaking the tax laws. i was shocked at their brazen attitude. when i demanded to know why they were angry, they wouldnt say. they realized that they didnt dare tell their manager that he had just stopped them from stealing from the business. but i knew exactly what they were mad about. i just wanted to know if they had the guts to tell me. both employees were soon removed from the business. i thought to myself time after time when i ran into these problems there has to be a better way than this! eventually, after much difficulty and personal suffering, i discovered that there was a better way. in fact, there was an easy way to run a business effectively. a way which almost nobody talks about. simply ask yourself this question why do some businesses work for the business owner and some businesses work for nobody? when you have the answer, you will enjoy the same revelation that i had. after i discovered what made a business really work, i gained a new power. when i went into a business, i knew right away if i was in a business where the owner was in charge or the employees were in charge. it just had a certain feeling, you probably know the feeling as well, if you think about it. have you ever been to a restaurant where your server took an extremely long time to come over to your table? have you ever had an employee at a business say they don't offer a service when they do? this can happen if an emergency service cuts into the employees personal time and the employee doesnt want to do the work. have you ever dealt with government employees who have no reason to work faster, or help people beyond what is required? why open more than one service kiosk, even if the long line is going out the door, if nobody tells you to? these are all employee controlled businesses. after dealing with many issues in the business world, some on the edge of unbelievable, i now run a successful business with good honest employees who like the work. i can take a holiday and come back and my business is still there, working well and making money. oh sure, you might have to remind the occasional person to come in on time, or not to wear an outlandish t-shirt at work, but all things considered, it runs pretty smoothly these days. although there's no real way to test this, i would even venture to say my employees like me. we can openly discuss the topics of the day and have an enjoyable conversation. can you imagine? employees actually liking their boss? i had a choice when i wrote this book. i could have filled it with a bunch of pointless platitudes and useless information but i decided to write something better. i have worked too long and hard and i didnt want to fill this book with a bunch of ideas that dont work in the real world. i want to get things done, and move on! these poorly run businesses just get under my skin. in some ways, i had to write this book because i know these struggling businesses are just crying out for help. my greatest hope is to go to a business, get great service, and see the employees all enjoying their jobs. this is a sign of a successful business. i look over and see the manager reading my book and we both give each other a silent nod, one manager to another. then we continue on with our lives.

my coding bootcamp students are refusing to pay for tuition. what should i do?	hello reddit! i run a coding bootcamp and my coding bootcamp has a tuition waiver program making it possible for students to take my course for free. before applying for the tuition waiver program, i have my students sign a contract in which they agree to have their tuition waiver revoked if they fail my course. as a result, they would be responsible for paying for tuition if they fail or don't register for my course on time . do any of have bad experiences with customers flat out refusing to pay invoices when you provide services to them? in fact, many of my clients have been flat out rude by claiming that they don't want to take my course even though they should've read the terms and conditions of the contract they signed. there are even late fees according to my contract so i don't understand why they are so resistant. what can i do about this? should i take them to court ? i am willing to contact a collections agency to help me out but i doubt they will be useful. plus they take a commission.

how do luxury brands prevent dilution and thus protect their business?	i may be thinking of ultra luxury, i'm not sure. and maybe this is a non issue. but let's take rolls royce for example. i'm certain they don't want everyone and their dog to be driving some used 10 year old rr car for cheap. not if they want to stay known as an exclusive ultra luxury brand. granted tons of people having a rr isn't necessarily a bad thing for the company, right? but it's just not the business strategy they're employing. they're not playing that game. they're playing the super expensive luxury game. which relies on being exclusive. richie rich may not want your car if his chauffeur drives a very similar one to work. why pay so much for the damn thing, if that's the case. why not just get a honda? i think that the very high end car brands fight peasant ownership by requiring very expensive maintenance to be done at the dealership. that's a win/win for the company. charge those rich people more money, and keep the brand's image intact. but how do the other companies do it? how does louis vuitton do it? sure you can sell an $800 women's handbag that cost you $40 to make, but how do you keep it from winding up on ebay for $60 4 years later? i have the same question regarding several other luxury brands and industries, but i think i've made my point. how do they ensure they're always seen as the top dog, or high class? and keep their products off the market at cheap prices? just something i'm curious about, as i enjoy learning about business tactics.

 how do big companies start?	 hello! i'm a young 17-year-old teenager from sweden that wants to do business in the future and own my own corporation. i'm currently trying to learn as much as i can about it, and there's something i'd like to learn more about. if we look at big companies today like blackrock, amazon, tesla, or saudi aramco we see that they're very successful and they are large industrial distributors around the world. of course, you may ask why don't you research yourself about how companies start? , i get that. but i'd like to get an overall view of it. so, my question is, all these big companies today, how did they start? how did they begin? how were they able to fund themselves in the beginning and how did they go from a small business start-up to the world's largest mega-corporations ? if you have any knowledge you'd like to share with me, feel free. i'd love to learn more about this.

who is in the right?	so i recently purchased some hats and upon receiving them i had noticed that there was some minor damage. i checked the site to see if they still had the product in stock and they did, so i reached out to the company via email to ask in this situation if they could do an exchange or full return. the owner responded back with a link to their website . looking at that they wanted me to pay them to one restock the damaged item and two to ship out the product. i disagree with that policy in this situation because the item was defective from them, that is not my fault so why should i pay?? i asked the owner if that was really the process, why do they make you pay that even for damaged items & he simply said that's the policy he's not making me do anything. which i felt was a weird way for someone to speak to a customer . i went on to continue to ask why that was the case since they were the ones who sent me the product damaged and he continued to be unhelpful in any way, basically saying to me when i asked for further help to look at the website. he came off as he couldn't be bothered to help and wanted nothing to do with it. i then called him an asshole due to the way he was treating me and went on to further say that i just wanted to talk to get clarification on the policy in this case and if there was anything else he can do and he told me what you want to hear and what i said are different, so sorry. and that was it and ignored me after. aside from me calling him an asshole lol what's the deal with this? at the very least if he treated me with some respect and had said my apologies that your product came damaged, but this is our exchange policy regardless at least he apologized.. but throughout the entire exchange he never once offered me any help besides directing me to the return policy. i decided to reach out to the bank to dispute the transaction, so idk how that will go, but just a overall weird interaction, by far the weirdest reaction i have ever had with an employee or owner of a company.

starting a trade/service business with a friend - good/bad idea?, who gets payed what?	hi all! if i may state my basic/foundational business background upfront, i took a years worth each of personal finance class, along with both entrepreneurship and business law classes in the latter years of high school in addition to my core/required classes. i am thinking of/planning to start a lawn care business. i have no plans to grow it to be huge at the moment, as in owning 5 trucks and having multiple teams however i may want to go into business with a partner/employee, who will in turn have some financial responsibility, some small duties in running the business like collecting payments and will of course will be helping me complete each job. i have considered going solo, but ive determined that having a partner affords me the ability to be out sick or to take off as a result of injuries should they happen as well as go on short vacations. not to mention the obvious marginal increase in productivity. i would plan to invest about 80% of the startup costs of my own money, and have my partner put down the other 20%. duties in the actual work on the job will be split pretty evenly, but duties on the business side will be leaning mostly on me despite my partner still having some responsibilities such as talking to potential clients, collecting payments from customers/sending out invoices, hanging door flyers/signs. i will handle the primary marketing side, scheduling, management of accounts/finances etc. the friend is a friend i met in my junior year of high school. not necessarily a brother-like best friend to me, and i wouldnt be afraid to fire him if he proved to be a hindrance. while hes not my best friend in the world, hes still a good buddy who id absolutely love being in business with. he reminds me to keep it simple and enjoy the journey and not always take life so seriously. is it a bad idea to go into business with a friend in this situation? anything i should change? also, this is of course up to me but i want to get some opinions on the best way to share net profits. i.e 70/30%, 60/40% etc.	gnarlidrum	/r/business/comments/pkfneo/starting_a_tradeservice_business_with_a_friend/	5	1	0	1.0	1631123853.0

advice for an aspiring business/farm owner	i'm a 24 yo male, and still fairly new to reddit. thank you for taking the time to read this. amid all the struggles that came with the pandemic, i've been able to look inward at things i like to do and how that can be provided as a service for others. i've taken a course in college for horticulture, as plants and growing are something i've been fascinated by for multiple years. this is something i want to make a profession of, incorporating what i've learned over the years. my idea is starting a farm, big enough to sustain different facets including csas and food truck, but not so big to where each crop doesn't get the tlc i'd like to be able to provide with few employees i go back and forth between what would give me the most practical start, which i keep thinking a farm first will be the most practical way to get started as opposed to sourcing foods from elsewhere; i want to be mindful of carbon emission, which means limiting those outside sources. the ideal end goal would look something like a self-reliant food truck and possibly small cafe to follow when more funding becomes available. i don't have experience with finances or management but am willing to put in the hard work and arduous hours required to make something good happen. any starting steps/resources/advice would be greatly appreciated, and i'm open to even any possible business partners that may be interested down the line! thank you all for your time, much love and light to you.	jedi-hazed	/r/business/comments/plvobi/advice_for_an_aspiring_businessfarm_owner/	5	2	0	0.75	1631314740.0
i am 20 years old and want to expand my fathers 15 year old paver/flooring contractor business	so my father has been in this business for very long. in my location many construction sites exist and demand is quite high for pavers/building workers, electricians etc... my father makes good money in his business, but he is still self-employed and he only expanded to 2-3 employees alongside him. currently we have 2-3 architects which build and sell homes and usually give us the tiling work. depending on season we might have a month or two, with no work for us to do at all. well, i feel like my father does not really have the will to expand and to go on.. he seems quite satisfied with the things we already have. but i see the potential to do more. he brings a lot of experience with him, and i just feel it all kind of goes to waste. for example, we still aren't registered as a company, we don't have a website, we don't advertise, we don't even have a logo. so what i am saying is, my father brings a lot of experience/knowledge, he does an excellent job and has a very good reputation. he does a 9.5/10 job and knows his business a-z. he has a lot of contacts and people request to work for him. he knows other flooring companies and their owners as well. so my father is the experience side, the technical side, and i want to take care of the business kind of side. what i bring will to expand, communication skills, will to learn, endurance, will to make a website logo etc, will to commit my time to the business, will to hustle. . i feel like my father and i cancel out many things about each other, we could become a great duo. my goal and vision first of all is to get more clients and customers, big and small construction sites, then start to expand into selling tiles and all the things someone might need to do tiling work and at the end to ultimately start building homes by ourselves and selling/ renting them. it seems a little farfetched, but i believe in fast and smart expanding, and construction allows for many opportunities. &; i feel like i need guidance on this, and i am sure that my father won't support me at first, but i really see the potential behind this plan, as i know that my father was able to run his business very stable-ish for the last 10-15 years and brings a lot of experience. &; why start a new business when you can expand your current one. i always wanted to start a new one in a different field, but this is an obvious opportunity which i missed, i just don't have a lot of knowledge in construction &; i am asking the reddit community humbly, on guidance and tipps to fulfil this mission, it will be difficult, but i want to try doing it right . &; thank you. best regards d.t.
