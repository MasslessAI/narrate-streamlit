my baby does this thing where her whole body stiffens up...	we first saw this when she was 3 weeks old, we ended up in the er and were discharged 30 minutes later with a diagnosis of fussy behavior . my daughter was laying on her back in the evening after a particularly fussy day. all of a sudden she appeared to stop breathing. her face turned red, almost maroon, her arms stuck straight out at her sides and were shaking, her tongue was sticking straight out, her eyes were huge, wide and appeared to be saying help me . my sister noticed this and picked my baby up within a few seconds at which point she gasped, and started crying a horrible cry i'd never heard before. this has happened a few times since then, but it seems to be changing. it only happens when she is laying on her back . her entire body gets so stiff that i can't bend her arms or legs. and they stick straight out. it seems like she takes herself out of it now, whereas the first few times she didn't snap out of it until picked up. she doesn't hold her breath anymore but rather gasps over and over. i had my pcp tell me she has seen this in infants and that they outgrow it. that it's a painful gas reaction. basically the baby freaks out cause it can't get rid of the gas. please, someone tell me you've seen this before, it's normal, it'll go away... or even if it's not normal please tell me a name to a test i can ask the doctors to do... anything. thank you.

looking for diaper suggestions to get through the night	my 8 month old has been sleeping for a solid 12 hours since he was about 3 months old! i'm certainly not complaining, but over the last month, he has been peeing through his diaper, soaking his clothes and sheets. we have been using pamper's and have had no problems. when he started peeing through early on, i discovered the overnight diapers and they worked perfectly. now that he is growing and eating more food, he's peeing more and they aren't so perfect. this last week, i have been cutting the 'pad' out of another diaper and inserting it into his overnight diaper. he has had no leaks, but the crystals sometimes come out and are causing a mess. i've also tried placing a maxi pad in the diaper, but that leaked. do any mom's out there have suggestions? i'm a little hesitant to spend lots of money on other brand diapers since we have such good luck with the fit of pamper's. has anyone requested a 'sample pack' from different brands before splurging and taking a chance on a whole box?	mommav	/r/Mommit/comments/2raskt/looking_for_diaper_suggestions_to_get_through_the/	11	2	0	1.0	1420379312.0
if you don't live where you were raised, how do you feel about your children's accents?	or future accents for those with little ones. my wife and i are considering moving to a place where our kids would definitely acquire a non-desirable accent. i don't care a lick, probably because we are a bilingual family and the accent wouldn't be my language, but i see my wife wince when she thinks about it. i think it will actually make her sad. my wife has strong ties to get hometown but doesn't even like her own accent, though, so maybe she's just an outlier.	clown-penisdotfart	/r/Mommit/comments/2rbkin/if_you_dont_live_where_you_were_raised_how_do_you/	17	21	0	0.9	1420398055.0
stay at home moms - how do you get out of the house now that it's cold and flu is rampant?	in the summer my son and i go to the park, library, zoo - you name it. but now that it's cold outside and the flu is super widespread in my city, and i have a pretty big fear of germs, so i don't know what to do. we have total cabin fever. i'm afraid to even take my son with me grocery shopping or to church. we get out to my mom's house about twice a month, but she lives an hour away and my son gets carsick. i have no other family or friends who live close. and a little backstory my son was a preemie and was really close to death for a while. it was terrifying and i know that that probably has some to do with my fear of him getting sick. i push myself through it in the summer with lots of antibacterial lotion and hand washing, but flu season is a real thing and not something i think i can or should overlook. please help. my house is a wreck and i'm slowly losing my mind. so here are my questions do you all shut yourselves in to escape the cold and germs? how do you get around it? what do you do for fun? am i crazy?	crkhtlr	/r/Mommit/comments/2rcpil/stay_at_home_moms_how_do_you_get_out_of_the_house/	14	22	0	0.83	1420420182.0
suggestions for clipping babys nails	my lo is 5 months old and i need to clip his nails but the last time i used clippers i got a tiny bit of skin on his thumb and he started crying, i was crying and it took forever to stop bleeding. i've tried biting his nails but they just end up jagged and rough. i've tried while he's sleeping, it's just so hard to do nails that are not your own! i've heard good things about nail scissors. any other recommendations? he keeps scratching his face and i feel so bad but i don't want to accidentally clip his skin again.	kitkatkelly_	/r/Mommit/comments/2rejqz/suggestions_for_clipping_babys_nails/	42	23	0	0.9	1420468740.0
how do you remember to take vitamins? seriously.	my husband and i are trying for 2 again this month after a late miscarriage in october. i had a hard time remembering to take my prenantals then and i want to do better. i usually would remember 5x a week, but i want to remember 7x a week while trying and while being pregnant. when pregnant with my son i left my vitamins on my desk next to the bed; that is obviously not ideal with a handsy two year old. how do you guys remember? we aren't very structured on timelines during the day, which i think has made this difficult. thanks for your input!	baristamama	/r/Mommit/comments/2rh7ua/how_do_you_remember_to_take_vitamins_seriously/	15	4	0	0.64	1420516522.0

how can i remove a hair splinter from my baby's foot?	my dog has short straight hair, and my baby somehow got got one imbedded in her heel. no end of the hair is outside the skin. the hair looks to be totally imbedded inside her heel. we have tried tweezers when she sleeps, but we were unsuccessful. we tried ahome remedy involving baking soda and bandages overnight which also didn't work. does anyone have any idea for something else to try? we may have to take her to a doctor, but i have no idea what they could do. she screams and won't let anyone look at it while she is awake. i'd love any suggestions! thanks!!!	pregotastic	/r/Mommit/comments/2s82jg/how_can_i_remove_a_hair_splinter_from_my_babys/	3	1	0	0.67	1421107652.0

when should i sleep?	hi. new here - just graduated from r/babybumps nine days ago. my lo had a dehydration issue in the first week because she was not getting sustenance from the breast like i naively thought she was, and now based on instruction from doctors and lactation consultants, we are pumping and feeding. we are also trying to encourage her to nurse... she just tends to fall asleep at the breast and won't go for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. so our schedule goes as follows 5-10 minutes try breast feeding 20-30 minutes actual bottle 20-30 minutes i pump 30-60 minutes baby wake time finally, she will go to sleep. but by this time i often have one hour or less to choose between sleep, eating, going to the bathroom, etc. i'm exhausted and i don't think this is sustainable. when her dad gets home from work, he can take over the bottle feeding, but i still have to be awake to attempt nursing and to pump, so it gets me an extra half hour out of each 3 hour rotation, tops. i know we must be doing something wrong or inefficiently. is there a better way? when do i sleep? and eat? can we skip a pump session in a 24 hour period without losing milk supply? how in the world does everyone do this? i really appreciate any advice.	clean_hands	/r/Mommit/comments/2seu0j/when_should_i_sleep/	13	6	0	0.88	1421252157.0

found out a few hours ago im a predaddit. need advice from the other side of the chromosome to support my soon to be mommit and child. posted the same sob story to the daddits to get their advice initially. any thoughts from you ladies?	this is a throw away account... i want to tell my story openly and anonymously. i just found out a few hours ago... we're pregnant my history... i've been a cop for 17 years. 17 years of pure fun! chasing bad guys, kicking in doors to save the day, helping neighbors settle disputes, solving the craziest crimes, helping the innocent, and on and on. my story as chronological as it gets... met the girl of my dreams back in 2012. she's awesome and i love her to death! a few months later, in 2013, i was attacked by a kid in a local high school. i sustained a major injury to my back. as a result, i have lost my job as a cop. not because i'm crippled or anything... i just couldn't bear hug a bad guy and take him down to the ground. the local police department doesn't have positions for limited duty. i'm too modest to apply for a disability cause i can answer phones and report to any job. 2014 was a very bad year for me. i was in denial. kept doing my physical therapy under workman's comp, praying that i would get better. obviously its not going to happen. here i am... in a 2 year relationship with a girl... waiting for me to get better. we always wanted to get married and i held off as long as i could cause i wanted to get back to work and start a stable family with a solid foundation for our beginning. knowing our financial situation is meager at best, because i had lost my job... we had a very small wedding and eloped to a sunrise wedding, a few weeks ago, on the 1st of this year. it was with humility and conviction that i asked her to be my wife that morning on a beach. humility, because we started the relationship where i was the super hero and dwindled down to less than ordinary with her as a witness to it all. conviction... how could i not ask her hand in marriage after all we had been through? she's as rock solid as me! i felt horrible that i gave her an elopement... not the dream wedding of every girl. - it's a huge drop from $70k a year salary... i will do what i have to do... as long as i'm working, i'll be happy. i know some of you are 30 something and younger... but here is a little insight from the way i see it. when i got hired by the police department... there was no such thing as google, simplyhired, or linkedin. resumes were hand typed. i'm very computer literate ... way ahead of my generation... but no degree in business or anything. - i'm really beginning to feel left behind in the world. any crowd sourced idea you can throw my way... i'd appreciate it. i live in tampa area... i'll do anything... i'll flip burgers if i have to... but i'm worth so much more. i just want to provide better than that. i know i'm worth it. every job posting asks for a bachelors... and when i say police science... they are like... how does that apply to us? i'm very quickly passed over for a business degree. thanks for your time and any tips to find the right job. fyi... i'm posting this to a couple of other similar subs for a diverse mix of answers. feel free to ask me anything.

i want to be a sahm.	i have 2 littles girls. the oldest turned 3 in october and the youngest was born in the middle of december. i first got a job when the oldest was six months old. i got it because i needed it. i had just turned 18 and we were only living on so's unemployment because he had lost his job not long before and we had decided at that time it made more sense for me to find a job first so that we would have two incomes. it was my first job and i've been there since then. it's just at a gas station but i've managed to work my way up from part time to full time to shift manager. i make just under $10 an hour so it's pretty ok money. so has a good job making almost $16 an hour. we have bought our house . we have a couple thousand saved up in the bank other than the mortgage we only have a small personal loan and a car to finish paying off. both of which will be taken care of with income taxes. i also do everything i can to save money. i coupon, almost all of our clothes come from thrift stores. anything i don't buy at resale is usually on sale at the store. i'm supposed to be going back to work on the 28th and the closer i get it is making me sick. i've been so obsessed with work since i started i didn't realize how much i was missing with my 3 year old and i feel awful leaving my poor baby at only six weeks. i think we are in the perfect place for me to stay home but anytime i mention it so kind of just laughs it off. i also feel guilty that i won't be bringing in an income. i like to do crafts and was thinking i could craft a little in downtime and set up at the couple of craft fests that our town has during the summer for a little extra money. i just don't know how to convince so if this. i don't know if he thinks i won't like staying at home or what his reasoning is but it's driving me nuts and i'm not going to put stress on our relationship by quitting my job if we aren't both on board.

i need your help, mommit	i have 5 year old twin boys who are in kindergarten this year. they have been potty trained for 3 years. the older one still has potty accidents during the night, so we have him in a pullup. i figured this was something he would just grow out of, i know it takes some kids longer than others. he is also having potty accidents at school pretty frequently for a 5 year old . sometimes they notice and send him home with new pants. other times, they don't notice . i don't know what to do. we've had lots of talks about going to the bathroom as soon as you feel like you need to go, i've emailed his teacher and asked that she please remind him to go potty before he goes to lunch, out to recess etc. today when he came home he had both wet clothes in a bag and he was also wet himself . i sat him down and tried to understand what was going on, asked where he was and why he didn't get to the bathroom. he said he couldn't hold it, so i asked why he was holding it. let him know it's always ok to go to the bathroom and if he can't find one to ask a teacher or an aid right away. i'm not sure what else to do, mommit. i feel terrible for him, i don't want him to get made fun of by other kids. is there something i'm missing? please help!	throw_away_mommit	/r/Mommit/comments/2szivf/i_need_your_help_mommit/	4	3	0	0.81	1421707828.0

daycare dilemma - help! need advice!	i need some advice on something i witnessed today - tell me if i'm overreacting. my son is 4.5 months old and has been going to an in-house daycare since early december. the daycare is run by a woman, her husband, and her sister at their home in a nice neighborhood. they've been doing this for 20 + years. they are licensed with the state. she was very highly recommended to me by a trusted friend who lives for her kids. her 4 year old just stopped going there because she started pre-school this year. they only have one other 'baby' under 1 year and only ever have 7 kids total in their care, none older than 5. i had been happy with them so far. they are ok with cloth diapers, read him his books every day, and seem to know him well already. i drop him off in the am and my husband picks him up. today i left work early to avoid bad traffic from the snow storm and showed up unannounced to get him. when i got there, the husband was outside doing something in the back yard and didn't see me, so i opened the door i saw my baby in the room by himself in the swing, crying and reaching up at the mobile. i called out 'hello?' a few times and no one answered so i went over to him and took him out of the swing and found the ladies in the other room with the other baby and kids who were napping. one was doing some paperwork and the other was watching the weather on tv. they seemed a little surprised but played it cool. i should have said something then but i was too flustered and kind of zoned out in shock. they said he had just finished his bottle and was going to sleep. could be true.. he could have just started crying right before i opened the door.. but i don't know why they were just sitting in there letting him cry in the other room.. i know babies have to cry a little sometimes but shouldn't they always be within view of someone? i can't get the sight of him crying and struggling all alone out of my head now. my husband assures me it was just a 'fluke' and the guy probably just went outside to do something and forgot to lock the door, but didn't think that anyone could sneak in past him... but i did - he didn't see me go in. i could have been anyone. that's the most upsetting part to me.. i could have walked out the door with him without saying a word if i had wanted to. my husband says whenever he picks him up , the door is always locked and they have to let him in and one of them is usually holding our son if he is awake. the only other time i had to pick him up, the door was also locked and he was sitting on the lady's lap and smiling. so what do i do? say something to them about it? find another daycare? husband says it will be the same anywhere we send him because that's what daycare is like, they can't pick up every baby every time they cry... i'm wondering if just reminding them to keep the door locked is enough. could i anonymously call an official from the state and have them check in on it? what do i do guys? i think if i told my mom or mil they would be horrified and say to find another daycare right away. easier said than done but this is my baby's safety we're talking about 	daycaredilemmahelp	/r/Mommit/comments/2tsn1a/daycare_dilemma_help_need_advice/	18	11	0	0.72	1422325732.0
first time last night dealing with a puking toddler..saying i didn't know what i was in for is an understatement.	the night before last, my husband and i had gotten in from a road trip we took a few hours north to see friends and family, but our daughter stayed at my moms. picked her up, got home and everything seemed fine. everybody was down for the count when i hear my husband saying my name trying to wake me up. p puked all over ok, ok. let me pee first. expecting to simply change her sheets and replace her jammies and blanket, i walked into her room and the smell could probably gag anyone. it was nasty. so while i'm doing this, my husband is changing her, trying to get her to calm down and she kept reaching for me and it felt like such a pathetic moment. she was so sad and it was heartbreaking. i try to keep her cleaned up, take her down stairs til her tummy settles and then put her back in bed to sleep it off. nope. the second i put her down she started crying. i picked her up and tried to soothe her...and then another wave of vomit. so to the bathroom we rush! barely made it. it was all down the front of her, me, the bathroom floor and spilling over the side of the tub as i had her stand in the tub while i strip her down. then she was scared of the tub. then she puked in her next set of pj's. on and on, guys. from 2 30 that morning until just shy of 6am, i had my first experience with a seriously puking toddler. she finally accepted some pedialyte and has been drinking on that and water since she woke up for the day. my poor baby..i wish she didn't have to experience that. update her bug made its way to me and husband. let's just say i'm glad we have two bathrooms. and thank you guys for all your get well wishes 	GrimaldiJ	/r/Mommit/comments/2tur0r/first_time_last_night_dealing_with_a_puking/	35	56	0	0.94	1422376504.0
 the giving tree book. what a jerk.	my baby boy is getting to the age where he's enjoying looking at books. this past weekend i decided to read him the giving tree, since he loves black and white pictures. i haven't read this book since i was a child, and i didn't remember how it ended. i got 2/3rds of the way through and realized what was going on. oh my goodness. i starting crying uncontrollably reading this book, reading that this tree was giving the boy her everything. i can't believe this is a kids book. the boy is so greedy and the tree just gives and gives. and she was happy.

working moms what do you do when your sick time gets used up taking care of your sick kid? how do you prioritize?	i have an enormously shitty cold right now and i'm all hopped up on neocitron and nyquil, so now seems like a good time to vent about what bullshit it is to be a working mom sometimes. i work in a very busy health unit and my daughter goes to a babysitter's house 5 days a week, so naturally we get sick fairly regularly. when i went back to work in september after being a stay at home mom for my daughter's entire life , i didn't realize how weak our immune systems were. i can never bank any extra sick time because i only get a few hours a week, and then either my daughter gets sick or her babysitter gets sick and i can't find a back-up. i can't afford to take time off when i inevitably catch something, and my workplace is so understaffed that it causes big problems whenever i can't come in. my husband is sometimes able to take a day off when the baby's sick, but he makes almost three times as much as i do, so that's not good for us economically. also, he sometimes has to leave town for a week or more to go work at industrial camps, making me the temporary sole caregiver for this little germ machine. it drives me crazy when i see other people at work use their banked sick time to take an extra week of vacation. it's the most helpless feeling to need to be at work but also needing to be there for my sick baby. my coworkers tell me i should never feel guilty for putting my family first, but sometimes i really wish my career could be a priority. it's dumb that i feel like a horrible mother for even thinking that, especially since i've worked so hard to get to where i am. anyway, i would love to know how other working moms deal. i'm constantly battling guilt for being a bad mother/bad employee, sadness that my stupid union is forcing me to choose between taking care of my baby or myself, and anger that i work for an organization that pays admin staff less than any other position. what drives you when it feels like the world is telling you your career isn't as valuable as your role as a mother?

where did my happy baby go?	my son has always been a happy baby, never really fussed, never cried too much, always a good eater and sleeper. now, at thirteen months its like all hell has broken loose. i feel like my parenting is terrible or something. he wakes up grumpy, screams at me until i feed him, throws his toys at me, throws himself on the floor, scratches if i try to put him down, its horrible. and so stressful. we found out he was lactose intolerant last month, so we've made changes for him, he still eats decently, and drinks lots. he's sleeping better i just seriously miss my happy baby. i don't know what happened, if this is normal, or what to do. i am at my wit's end and i am fried with stress.	inkitupandpierceit	/r/Mommit/comments/2uffus/where_did_my_happy_baby_go/	19	3	0	0.8	1422815263.0

first time mom, and i could really use some advice/encouragement!	hello guys!!!! i am so excited to say i am the very proud mommy to an adorable 3 month old boy - i am very lucky to be able to stay home with my little dude and other than a few normal bumps in the road things have been going great!!!!! my son is developing so well, but i have noticed that he is starting to prefer my husband. he will light up as soon as my husband enters the room and will always smile at him no matter his previous mood. i realize that my son doesn't dislike me, he isn't overly fussy or upset when i have him and he will smile for me but i just find it odd that he would be so attached to my husband so soon. my husband works odd and long hours so i have our son the majority of the time. my husband is a great dad, but he mostly just plays with our lo, while i am the one providing all the care. as much as i hate to admit it, i am getting rather insecure about it. i am so glad our son is happy and obviously i want him to love his daddy and for daddy to love him. i just feel like as his mother and primary care giver, he should be more attached to me? has anyone else experienced this? is it normal? could i be doing something wrong?

advice on 6 month old nursing to sleep	i have a 6 month old who only sleeps/naps while i nurse her. we have a pretty good routine going and she can also sleep through the night no problem. i've tried every once in a while to put her to sleep without nursing her. ive been successful a few times but i've never been consistent with it. i wanted to wait a couple weeks until i really dive down and stop nursing her because we are moving back to the united states from where the time distance is about 13 hours. do you any of you have any advice on how i should go about doing this? she doesn't take a pacifier and hardly ever takes a bottle.	chocolatarian	/r/Mommit/comments/2un0bz/advice_on_6_month_old_nursing_to_sleep/	13	6	0	1.0	1422974181.0

how do i end co-sleeping, swaddle? help	i am writing this here because i have no where else to vent. no where else to ask for help. my son is almost 13 months old. we co-sleep and still nurse. this has not been a problem until recently. he has to be swaddled to sleep still. yes, at 13 months. i tried every way possible to wean him from the swaddle and nothing worked. he will not calm down to sleep unless his arms are restrained, so sleep bags don't do it. recently he has been waking up about 20-30 minutes after i get him to sleep. he gets his arms out and while he's nursing claws at my chest. i try to hold his hands but he gets angry. then he tries to stand up and nurse while we're in bed. he won't calm down and go back to sleep. it's been like this for the past week. i am so tired. endless, sleepless nights. i don't know what to do. i can't get rid of this fucking swaddle because it's the only way i get some sleep. when he's out of it he won't calm down. i had my husband set up the crib just so that i could set him inside for a few minutes of peace. he screams bloody murder the second i put him down. my husband works a night shift so of course he isn't around for any of this. i welcome any advice here. i'm getting worried because i find myself getting very angry and frustrated with my son. i know he's a baby but in my sleep-depraved state i get so irritated. that's when i have to walk away.	babydrivingmenuts	/r/Mommit/comments/2uqf88/how_do_i_end_cosleeping_swaddle_help/	8	5	0	1.0	1423034243.0
how to find work after 5 years as a sahm?	is there anyone in this group who has stayed home to raise kids for a significant number of years, and is wondering how to find a job once the kids are in grade school? that's where i'm at. in 18 months my youngest kid enters kindergarten, and i'm eager to return to the workforce--i used to work in publishing. but there are no publishing jobs in this town i live in now, and i've been out of the job market for almost five years now i am not so concerned with finding a position in my former field, but it would be good to find a steady, family-friendly position with benefits, with growth potential. have any of you been in this same boat? how did you return to the workforce after an extended absence??? how did you convince potential employers to take a chance on you? share your stories! thanks.

x-post i've petitioned the white house to offer equal benefits to sahps when proposing childcare credits	x-post from sahp the obama administration has recently asked congress to increase the childcare tax credit to $3000 per child. i agree with supporting families, but i dont think the proposal should stop at helping parents who are paying for childcare. just as some families have to go out of pocket for the cost of childcare, families with a sahp are also making do with less money by living on one income. if a couple with two young children could manage to have a parent stay home with the assist of a $6000 tax break, i think its wrong to have a policy in which the government says sorry, but if you both go to work we can give you that $6000 for childcare costs. so ive started a this discussion is about families which do have income. the white house proposal is for a non-refundable tax credit, which is only helpful to families which have enough earnings to owe federal income tax. support for very low-income or unemployed parents would be a separate discussion. im not in line for any tax break myself. my children are in their twenties and i dont have grandkids. im doing this because i was a sahm and i care about equal respect and support for sahps.

my child is devil at naptime and i don't know what to do. 12 weeks old.	okay so my daughter just turned 12 weeks as of today. she is adorable, i love her to bits and pieces except when she is tired. she makes no indication she is sleep. she'll yawn, and then it's like i need to be put down now or i'm going to go to level 9000 in seconds. her cry is loud. so it becomes really stressful for me when in trying to soothe her and she is screaming so loud right in my ear!! her naps have been so short this last week and a half and i'm really losing my brain. i can do this whole naps for thirty, up for forty then spend thirty trying to calm her down for another thirty minute nap. it's a vicious cycle. i used my swing for a bit but now it's not giving her long naps anymore. so now, against all recommendations she is asleep on her belly in my bed. i am check on her often. how does one start a nap routine. i generally try to nap her at the same time but... i don't understand. she is tired usually an hour to hour and a half after she wake up so by 8 if she's not down all hell breaks loose then usually i want to get her down for another by noon assuming she took a long enough nap earlier. and then another about 3/4pm and then she goes to bed by 7 30 each night in her bassinet. i'm rambling. i'm confused. i'm lost. i feel guilty for being upset with her for being a baby. i get so frustrated sometimes and i think i'm a failure and i just want to help her be a happy baby and to sleep. she is just such a loud baby and i think it makes the situation seem worse than it really is. help? input?

attached toddler. any suggestions?	my daughter is a little over a year and a half, and has within the last few months become even more attached to mommy. i stayed home with her for a year before going back to work. i had ppd and as a result, i was afraid of not bonding with her. so, i devoted most if not all of my time engaging with her, playing with her and teaching her. i literally mean all of my time was completely focused on while she was awake. now that i have been working for the last six to seven months, i wonder if all that time i spent with her made her a needy and super attached toddler. i know that favoritism and separation anxiety begin to appear around this time, and that it means she is reaching developmental mile stones. great! however, i am going to lose my freaking mind! when i am home she is attached at my hip. i can't even use the bathroom! even if the door is closed, she's right outside waiting for me and all i hear is mama...mama . i try to check my grades for my classes, and she's either at my feet, besides me, or on my lap because she only wants attention from mama. she has a hard time playing by herself when i'm home, but when daddy and her are alone, she has no problem playing by herself in her room or in the living room. another issue that we've noticed is that she cannot stand when somebody other than herself - is hugging me - which results in her getting upset and throwing a mini tantrum. she doesn't even like my husband hugging me. a few weeks ago, she tried to hit a waitress for standing too close to me while she was taking my order. is this normal? does anyone have any suggestions? also, please do not take this as i don't like spending time with my daughter because i absolutely love and adore her, and every moment i have with her is precious to me. when i am home, i devote all my time and attention to her and the hubby.	iliahi90	/r/Mommit/comments/2w4rso/attached_toddler_any_suggestions/	2	14	0	0.82	1424129807.0

new to parenting, terrible twos, help?	hello! i am a recent divorcee. i do not have children of my own, but about six months ago i started dating someone with a two year old daughter . things were really awesome at first - kids have always generally liked me without me really trying. that's what it was like with me and her daughter . she would let me read to her, we'd go shopping for new shoes/clothes for her, and we'd binge watch disney movies together and sing all the songs. about a month into our relationship her kid's mom left the picture . it was really stressful at first - i mean like, super stressful. we are both professors and for about a week we were bringing the baby with us to work. fortunately, our bosses were really cool/understanding about it, and she was pretty cooperative and more than happy to sit during lectures with her toys or with snacks. we super lucked out shortly after however, and found someone who was a stay at home mom who agreed to watch her while i was at work. girlfriend is a full time professor, and i was only part time, so i still would pick her up after lunch and we'd hang out at the apartment until daddy was home. at this point, things were still pretty great. baby has been through some super big changes and was taking it all in stride. she's even sleeping in a toddler bed now, which was really exciting and awesome . fast forward a few months. i'm not sure if her 'development' was stunted because of the less-than-ideal conditions she'd been living in prior to aforementioned events, but she was becoming more and more demanding/unruly. she has her own bedroom now, filled with toys where she used to only have one or two, etc. girlfriend doesn't like telling her no, i think partly out of guilt but also because when the baby starts yelling/hitting it makes her anxious. her past relationship was emotionally abusive and i think it's really stayed with her in a lot of bad ways, and it makes it hard for her to handle things when tensions get high. meanwhile, i am more and more finding myself falling into the role of 'rules-lawyer'. i really, really hate it. it stresses me out and makes me feel anxious and depressed. my teaching contract was not renewed for this semester, so i am currently playing the role of full-time stay at home parent. i feel like that lotr gif, the one where king theoden laughs and says you have no power here, except i'm the worst gandalf ever and seriously have no idea how to encourage her to tantrum less/generally behave more positively. we don't do spanking, and we don't yell at her, and i don't think either of those things would help or accomplish anything anyway. where she used to be pleasant and fun 99% of the time, it seems like now she finds a way to pick a fight about everything - it's constant battles from breakfast to bedtime. so far the only solution i've found is to exhaust the crap out of her. as far as we know, the few times we've taken her to the sitter's for a night to get a break, she hasn't behaved this way, but this may be because she's got another kid her age to play with there. most of the time, if it's just me and her, the constant tantrums are frustrating but manageable. i can usually stay calm until it's over and laugh about it later, although the fights over her eating the breakfast she has spent the past 20 minutes literally begging for are exhausting only because i am such a grump in the morning and usually don't have time to get a cup of coffee until after she's fed. however, some days, like today, she is just extra awful. here's an example she'll scream she wants something. we ask her to say please, and she does, and we offer her the item. she frowns, says she doesn't want it, starts whining repeatedly saying she doesn't want it until she works herself into tears and more screaming. we leave it on her table, and eventually she will reclaim said item, but only after carrying on about it for a solid ten to fifteen minutes. rinse and repeat for virtually every activity or item or meal etc throughout the day, on a bad day. i don't have kids, but i'm assuming this is those terrible twos i've heard so much about. i'm really worried however that this might be aberrant behavior, possibly because of losing contact with mom or something, but it's been half a year so surely that's not it? i don't know. i just feel like the worst person ever, because i feel like i'm always telling her 'no', or having to force her to do things, like sit at her table and eat her food. i don't want to force her to do things, but -i- know she's grumpy because she's hungry, and when she does finally eat she almost instantly transforms into the sweet/cute little girl i vaguely remember her being. girlfriend doesn't like this because it makes her yell and cry more until she finally gives in. i'm not really sure what the correct solution is. instinctively i am not inclined to give in when she's throwing a fit, because i feel like it's rewarding that kind of behavior. however, this morning she stabbed me with her fork and she's at the stage now where she likes to hit/throw her food, so i don't think my approach is working either. we're both under a lot of stress besides the kid, and on top of all the other things i am worried about, i am also worried that she's picking up on this and it's contributing to her acting out. i'm stressed because i can't find a job, and i can't reliably work from home because i don't want to ignore her, and girlfriend's work has been loading her up with projects and she has no office hours or time to do them and has to choose between spending time with her daughter or working from home. we're going to be moving soon back to girlfriend's hometown to be near her siblings so that we can get breaks and have 'us' time and so kiddo can spend time with her aunts/uncles/grandmother, but until then things are really, really tense. if you read all this crap, i apologize for the extremely long post. i'm just at the end of my rope here. what are some things you guys do to positively redirect this behavior? is she just not getting enough exercise? i know when we do go out to the park or for a walk with the dogs she is a lot more manageable, but other times she just continues to tantrum no matter where we go. would it be better to just give her what she wants when she freaks out? should we be using time outs at her age ? also, the icing on the cake, she is about to turn 3 and she still isn't potty-trained. i started trying to work on that about a week ago as she has a training potty but she resolutely refused to tell me when she had to go, peed herself about 3-4 times, and then yelled at me to change her/yelled at me to stop changing her/yelled at me for underwear/yelled for a diaper/generally just kind of screamed a lot, which is understandable when you've peed yourself several times in one day and are quite tired of being smelly and wet. everything i'd read online said to just 'put her in underwear and she'd start asking for the toilet on her own' and that does not seem to be the case. i did ask her every 30 minutes or so if she had to potty and put her on the potty several times, and she always seemed to pee right after i'd ask and she said 'no', her favorite word. tl;dr help me mommit-wan kenobi, you're my only hope.	pennyroyals	/r/Mommit/comments/2wtedg/new_to_parenting_terrible_twos_help/	32	20	0	0.93	1424650948.0

need some advice on teaching my daughter about money management	hello fellow mommy's! recently, i was able to land a very good paying job with benefits. i told my daughter that once i get my first bonus check, that we will have a girls day and she can go on a shopping spree at justice. i gave her a $300 budget. told her that she can buy what ever she wants as long as she doesn't go over $300. this is the first time in a very very very long time that i was able to afford to buy her new clothes. we have always used clothes from garage sales or hand me downs. this is where it gets tricky. i told her she could invite one friend to come with and i'd treat them to lunch and ice cream. she invited one friend. her parents mentioned that they would give her some cash to purchase her own items from the store. fine. that's great so she doesn't feel left out. then i find out yesterday that she also invited the neighbor girl to come with. she told her that i was allowing her to use $300 to buy clothes. then tells the neighbor girl that she can buy her own clothes with my money!! she comes and tells me m is coming along too. i told her she can use $150.00 of my $300 budget . no. no. no!!!!!!!!! $150 is a lot of money! and she invited a second kid along without my permission. so i walked over next door and spoke to the mom. she knew something was funny when my daughter was offering $150.00 worth of clothes to her daughter. the mom understood that my daughter didn't know what she was saying. i am not sure if my daughter wants to seem cool that we are no longer living in poverty? i donno. i tried to talk to her about it and she gave me the usual response i don't know mom. i did tell her that i wanted to do this special thing for her since we do not get to do it all the time. plus she is running low on winter and summer clothes. any advice on how to teach her the concept that money doesn't need to be thrown away? was i wrong for telling her in advance on how much she was able to spend? i was so mad last night i was close to stopping the trip all together.		/r/Mommit/comments/2x1nov/need_some_advice_on_teaching_my_daughter_about/	17	8	0	0.91	1424819016.0
i have no idea what i am doing- maybe more experienced moms can help me	dear mommas- i am having trouble putting together my registery. i have no clue what to put on there. i know that some stores give you a check list, but are all those things really necessary??? an there are many online sites for your baby needs; but, i think asking real moms what help them is a better opiton. i have gotten my crib and car seat already and my mom is picking up a mattress. what are some of the items that you needed in those first days? how about the items that were needed in the first few months? what are a waste of money or really not too important to get right away? how soon do i need a stroller? do i need really need baby detergent? any advice is greatly appreciated. i want to knock out my registry this week but need guidance.	usagi_tamashiro	/r/Mommit/comments/2x279n/i_have_no_idea_what_i_am_doing_maybe_more/	26	11	0	0.88	1424827957.0
9 months old and milk supply is dwindling. need advice please!	my baby is just short of nine months old. i have noticed recently that my milk supply has been decreasing. i know this is in part due to him not nursing as much at night now. he has slowly been weening him self and is less interested in nursing and mostly wants actual food during the day too. all this is fine i don't mind that he wants to eat but because he is nursibg less my supply has greatly decreased and now i feel like even when he does nurse i'm not producing enough for him. my main question is because he is already 9 months is it okay to start transitioning him to whole milk or do i need to do formula till hes 12 months? i would really prefer to avoid having to transition him to formula if its only for a few months and he will transition again to milk. any advice would be greatly appreciated! even how to re-increase my supply. edit thank you everyone for all the info and suggestions. i have a lot to look in to and think about. i really woukd prefer to keep breatfeeding so i will be focusing on that for now and if i can't get my supply up i will at least have a lot of info for when i go talk to my gp about supply issues and transition option.

does a decent hands-free pumping bra exist? what do/did you all use?	i did a search of the subreddit to see if this question has been asked before but i didn't see a great discussion. i am currently using a medela pump and this bra by rumina. i also tried the and both are pretty terrible! the rumina bra works alright but isn't a comfortable all-day bra so to use it i have to take off the shirt and bra i am wearing and put it on then put back on a cardigan or whatever i have so i don't freeze to death while pumping in my air conditioned office. i found the medela bra impossible to put on though i probably have too small of a size. i have seen some references to freemies has anyone used them? how hard is it to transfer milk from the cup to the bottle? are they any tougher to clean than the medela setup? does anyone have any other recommendations? thanks! edit thanks for all the input guys! i'm going to try modifying an existing bra. great suggestions all around!	oooeee	/r/Mommit/comments/2xenom/does_a_decent_handsfree_pumping_bra_exist_what/	15	5	0	1.0	1425079102.0

need help buying used stroller - florida	hi ladies, i am from canada and there is not much of a market for used strollers anywhere near where i live. i'm looking for a used double stroller . planning on getting one while on vacation to treasure island area of florida at the end of april. if i can't get used i will still need to buy a cheaper walmart one while away since in canada we have all of 1 option for double jogging strollers unless you want to spent $800+. it will only be used for a little over a year i'm thinking since my son will be 2 when new baby arrives so i definitely can't justify spending that. my problem is there aren't a whole lot of options showing on craigslist right now and my husband & i are a bit iffy about the whole craigslist thing anyway since we wouldn't be familiar with the area where the person would be living . wondering if you moms could help me. are there any stores that generally carry used strollers in the tampa bay area? is there a facebook moms selling group i could look at joining to search? is it fine to ask the person should we decide to do the craigslist thing to meet at a mall or something nearby where they live? anyone on this sub in the area have what i'm looking for and want to sell to me? ; tia!

velcro baby wants to be held 24/7. help me!	i am a ftm to a nine day old baby girl. most of our transition to parenthood has been pretty smooth, and we have a really great support system, but we're struggling at night. like a lot of newborns, my daughter does not want to be put down, ever, for any reason. we can't get her to sleep for more than 15 minutes or so anywhere that isn't in our arms, which is not ideal for soo many reasons. we're working on getting her to sleep in the rock n play , but i have a couple questions about it. swaddling seems to be the key, but i wasn't sure if it was safe/okay to nurse her while she's swaddled and then put her down. i can't find much via google, but for some reason i got it in my mind that i shouldn't feed her while swaddled. is that true? also, i'm seeing a lot of information saying to let them cry it out, which is excruciating, but i get it. how long is it okay to let her cry for? i keep seeing vague guidelines like pick her up if she gets hysterical. what does hysterical look like? she's so little, and it's hard to reconcile all of the you can't spoil an infant, hold your baby stuff with the babies cry, let her work it out stuff. tl;dr two questions can i feed her while swaddled? how long should i let her cry for when trying to get her to sleep in the crib or rock n play?

looking for some advice on diapers	my son is 14 months old and has recently started peeing through his diaper when he sleeps. it's not just bed time, it happens during naps too. and it's not really that he's soaking through the diaper, but rather the pee is coming out of the top. a lot of times the diaper really isn't all that full. and it's always at the top of his pants/bottom of shirt. of course, i make sure he's pointing down when i put the diaper on but it doesn't matter, it's happening literally every time. i don't know if the fact that he sleeps on his belly has anything to do with it. i've tried going up in diaper size, but the next size up is pretty big on him and it still happens. the only thing that remotely helps is putting two diapers on him, with the top diaper on backwards. but even then he still wakes up wet sometimes, but less frequently. and that's so incredibly wasteful.. anyone else experience this? what helped for you? thanks in advance!	mmiissttyy	/r/Mommit/comments/2yajcx/looking_for_some_advice_on_diapers/	12	9	0	0.86	1425775387.0

12 mo old smacking himself when told no.	well mommit, long time lurker first time poster. sorry for weir format, on my mobile phone. well, my son has started this new thing where if he's getting into something and gets told no he'll give himself a tap on the side of his face. sometimes he'll even smack himself. i have no idea why! could it be a phase? i've tried telling him no sternly, or explaining to him gently not to hit himself, heck i've even tried to not acknowledge it at all. nothing works. what makes it worse is that my so and i live with his parents and his mother makes it seem like its my fault, or like i'm hitting him and that's where he picks i up. i have never spanked him or anything, so what could it be? i don't work and i'm the only one who takes care of him. he couldn't be picking it up from anyone. has this happened with any of your babies, mommit? any advice would be a great help!!	sospicesospice	/r/Mommit/comments/2yj3xe/12_mo_old_smacking_himself_when_told_no/	4	3	0	1.0	1425966219.0

daughter freaks out when she gets her diaper changed, should i be worried?	we've gone through a lot with her this last week and the time change didn't help any. so it's been almost two weeks since we transitioned her convertible crib into a toddler bed like this, but goes down fairly well at night. she had a cold this week and her nose has been really stuffy. this i guess may be when it started. she will not let us near her with the booger sucker. you know what i'm talking about? i've held her down, no chance of hurting her and she screams and freaks the f out. and every diaper change, give or take a couple, is a major fight. she twists and turns and does her damndest to get out of my grasp all so i don't change her diaper. her appetite hasn't changed, she hasn't run a fever, she went from two naps down to one, but still sleeps through the night, she plays and acts rather normal other than those two things. has any other mom had to deal with something like this due to illness, transition or something like teething? how to you get through it, because it's really fucking frustrating. quick edit you guys are awesome. i thought i was going crazy, and even though i've had years of experience with kids of all ages, i'd never had to deal with this..at least so badly. i freaking hope it gets better and soon. this has been the most exhausting week of my life in a very long time. i hope it gets better for all of you as well! i need a responsibility free day. i think we all do.

what to expect from preschool for an older baby? crossposted to beyondthebump	my daughter will be 19 months when we start part-time preschool. we toured the facilities and, while they are very nice, the one thing that threw me off is the nap time. daughter still takes two regular 1 1/2 hour naps daily. while they will accommodate her other nap, they only provide a nap-time setting for the afternoon nap. what they mean by accommodating the first nap is partially blocking her off from the rest of the room with all the lights on and normal activities going on. so, my question is, what can i really expect from that first week? i want to know if i can expect her to be a hot mess or if she will really love it. do you pack your child's own lunch? they have provided lunches and snacks but most seem way overly processed, which we don't do much of at home. do you have play clothes that they wear or do you dress them as you would if you were going out with them yourself? obviously, this is different for each child, but i want to hear your experiences and any other info or helpful tips i need to know. unfortunately, no wine-ding down for me after the first day as i'll be 8 months pregnant. some background she will be there two to three days a week from 8am-3 45pm, at the latest. she currently has a nanny who comes to our home, but they do not do many structured activities nor do they do any crafts. i'm excited about preschool so she can socialize, do crafts and sensory play, and, later on, do more preschool-type activities . thank you, mommies! 	crunchyfayetteville	/r/Mommit/comments/2zhzsi/what_to_expect_from_preschool_for_an_older_baby/	3	5	0	1.0	1426705821.0
any suggestions for a stubborn pooped?	my 6 month old has not been a cooperative pooped from day one, and we have tried everything we can think of- short of suppositories juice, soy formula, essential oil massage, warm baths, fruit pures, oatmeal, and multiple discussions with multiple sources for possible health issues. the consensus is that there is nothing medically wrong with her- this is helped by the fact that a couple of times a week she gives us a normal poop as opposed to doody balls. has anyone else dealt with this? what sort of things did you do to make your little one's 2s more comfortable/ softer?

how old did your child have to be before you let them go to a neighbor's house to play?	my husband and i recently moved to a new neighborhood where there are lots of kids around, our old neighborhood had hardly any children. last night, an 11 and 10 year old came to the house asking if there were any kids who could come out and play. i have a 7 year old who i share custody of who will be with me for the majority of the summer. i've never had to deal with this situation before. is 7 too young to let them walk alone a couple houses down to play? should i say they have to play at/near our house? i haven't met the parents or been to the house yet. your thoughts?

period after baby number 4 is super emotional, please help.	i have always been blessed with relatively easy periods. not much cramping, normal blood flow, emotions hardly change. until now. i had my 4th child 8 months ago and my last few periods have been a nightmare. heavy bleeding, cramping, and nearly constant crying. i cry because the baby is crying, i cry because my so said what? in a slightly annoyed tone when i tried to get his attention while he was in the middle of something, i cry because i think about how much i've been crying. i feel like a crazy person. i'm not even upset most of the time, but i cry anyways. it doesn't make any sense. i don't have ppd, and i am only like this for 2-3 days before my period until the 3rd or 4th day through it. i know i can't be the only person to have dealt with this crap. is there anything i can do to fix it?

new here, and i need help helping my children deal with death.	first time posting here, found you guys with the random button. so here's the thing... last monday, one of my best friends passed away and a few hours later my 9 year old godson passed away due to injuries he received in a car accident a few days earlier. the deaths were completely unrelated. now, all of my children were close to my friend because he used to live with us. only my 9 year old was close to my godson. i hated having to sit my children down and tell them about these two deaths that were completely senseless. now, they seemed to take the news well, but i've been noticing the last few days that anything makes them cry. for example, my 9 year old spent ten or fifteen minutes sobbing because the tablet battery died. normally he just sets it aside and goes and finds something else to do, but this time he curled up on my lap and held onto me and just cried. i cried, too. i knew he wasn't upset about the tablet, but when i ask him if he wants to talk, he says no. my 7 year old has been crying over everything at school, and my 4 year old is acting out and bullying her brother and sister. i don't know what to do. their insurance doesn't cover a therapist, so i have all of us on a waiting list through the college , but until then, i don't know what to do. it seems like they don't understand why they are sad, and i don't want to keep bringing it up because it seems to make things worse. how can i help them?	boobafett13	/r/Mommit/comments/30isev/new_here_and_i_need_help_helping_my_children_deal/	20	31	0	1.0	1427482722.0

i'm falling into depression because of my job and need advice.	i have a 3 month old daughter and have been working evenings. my husband works mornings and we hand off the baby and i go to work. the most i see my husband is when he comes home for his lunch break. i've been with the same company for 3 years now. things were going great, i was constantly a high performer and moving up fast with them. then i got pregnant... once i told them i was pregnant, their whole attitude changed towards me. i got passed up for a promotion that was promised me the week before i told them i was pregnant. they started asking me to do things then telling me i had no right to step on their toes and take those tasks on. they messed with my benefits, leaving me with no pay for my maternity leave. i can't prove this because they have a paperless system and claim the paper copy i have was a draft of my benefits and not what i agreed to. my gm got my short-term disability reinstated. my hr tried to put a claim in for me without my knowledge during september, baby wasn't due until january so in january they did because of the first claim, i was a fraud suspect ae they wouldn't grant me the pay. they then took 4 week longer to put me back into the system so i could work after i was released by my doctor. once i did come back, they cut my hours from full time to 15. they give me a hard time when i ask for breaks to pump. and last night i hit my breaking point when a male manger walked into the room i use to pump and just looked at me, grabbed what he came into the office for and then left...all the while leaving the door open for any one else to see. i was trying to cover myself the whole time. i spoke to my hr manger immediately after. all she said it's she would talk with him. i left early in tears. when i got home, my husband told me that he wants me to quit. he said since i've started back at work i'm an empty shell and wants his wife back. this made me cry even more. how can i just quit when money is so tight? has any one else dealt with this? any advice to pull myself out of this depression? help! edit thank you all for your advice and support! i have written my resignation letter and will be turning it in tomorrow.	twoob	/r/Mommit/comments/30p7z8/im_falling_into_depression_because_of_my_job_and/	13	21	0	0.96	1427638444.0
i need some advice	here's the situation. my ex husband has been with his fianc for over a year now. ex and i share two special needs kids. i have never met fianc. i asked him a year ago to set up a meeting, and he refused. now a year has passed, and he wants me to allow fianc to take care of kids without ex present. i told him that i do not know her, and therefore, do not trust her. i need to meet her in order to establish trust. about 7 months ago, she had something happen that is both tragic and traumatizing. he claims that my wanting a meeting is along the same lines as what happened. it's about as similar as comparing a dog to a cat and claiming they are the same animal. i ask you all, am i being unreasonable in wanting a meeting with fianc before i allow her to care for my kids?

my 4 year old seems to be developing a bug phobia. i don't know how to handle it.	rewind to day 2 of preschool this year, my 4 year old was stung by a bee. minor reaction, his hand puffed up, he returned to school the next day with no problem. we often discussed how we don't touch bees, and what good things bees do for us. he seems to be nervous around them, but nothing out of the ordinary. fast forward... the weather is improving here, spring is blooming, and the bugs are coming back out. flies specifically. he has now started screaming bloody murder if there's a fly in the car. he flips his shit. we talked about how flies don't hurt us, yada yada ya. he will hysterically cry while saying flies don't hurt me, flies won't sting me . i threatened to get the baby car seat back out because he was flailing and not staying properly in his booster/seatbelt. he just sadly said ok... which broke my heart into a million pieces. i have lost my cool, i have yelled at him, i have told him we won't be able to go to the park or ride in the car anymore. shocking none of this has worked right? for the first time i'm at a total loss of what to do and i feel like i'm breaking my kid. i'm hopeful it's just a phase for him. but our 20 minute drive home tonight really devolved. i'm failing here.	throwitawaynowrd	/r/Mommit/comments/31kbmu/my_4_year_old_seems_to_be_developing_a_bug_phobia/	7	2	0	0.67	1428273181.0

i'm trying to figure out how to help my daughters stuffy, but mostly runny nose. any suggestions? 	this is a cross post from r/askdocs. i thought maybe i would have some lucky with you ladies about this issue. >my poor daughter has been a bit miserable with a stuffy nose for the last couple weeks. it started with a cold, then no cold, but always a stuffy/runny nose. i'm thinking this could all just sum up to all the crazy weather we've been having and/or allergies. i'm hoping anyway. so anyways, as far as unclogging her nose i've tried vick's vapor rub, sitting in the bathroom with a hot shower going , the bulb boogie sucker/nosefrida boogie sucker , vick's vaporizer and have had that constantly running with the door closed so it helps. we haven't given her any otc medications as we are aware of the serious side effects. over the last couple days she's developed a cough with what sounds like a decent amount of mucus. of all the things i've read, i've noticed a lot of people suggesting that it's something that just has to work its way out; like medicine wouldn't do much help for her anyway kind of thing. snot is clear, no sign of infection. she hasn't had a fever. she's been acting normal and sweet like usual, and she doesn't seem to mind the stuffiness, as long as she every once in awhile wipes her nose with her arm. i think the main thing i'm concerned with is if this is something that may seem serious enough to take to her doctor tomorrow morning. i wish she could blow her little nose what do you guys think? any advice appreciated!

my baby did something that really freaked me out tonight, does anyone know what the deal could be? 	so, i was getting ready to feed and put my 2 month old down for the night. he was already mad but i had to change him and put him in his pajamas before i could feed him since he usually falls asleep while/immediately after eating. anyway, he was screaming and crying as i was changing his diaper, when suddenly he stops, his arms and legs sort of flail out and he has this scared/pained look on his face for a second, then he screams even louder/more intensely. it scared me and i picked him up as soon as i finished putting on his diaper and he almost immediately stopped crying and seemed fine as soon as i was holding him. i was so freaked out i was crying haha. after cuddling and feeding i put him down and now he's asleep, but does anyone know what could have happened? i had never seen this before today, but earlier this afternoon he did it while we were playing on the floor. at that time he was happy and then did the freak out thing and started crying, but i had thought it was because the dog licked his toes right at that moment and maybe it startled him. this time though he was up on the changing table and mid-diaper change, nothing strange touching him, nothing unusual going on . i seriously panicked, the look on his face was hard to describe, almost like when you blow in a baby's face and they catch their breath, except more terrified looking. i'll probably take him to the doctor next week just for my own peace of mind, but i thought i'd ask if anyone else has experienced this?	moon_slave	/r/Mommit/comments/32znsm/my_baby_did_something_that_really_freaked_me_out/	19	24	0	0.87	1429322604.0
how do you the handle the constant 'you're so pretty' comments towards your child? i feel i'm fighting an unwinable battle to teach my daughter that looks aren't what we should focus on.	i have a daughter that will be 5 soon. she's incredibly bright and well-spoken and loves to entertain people. she's very pretty. not just to me as her mom, but seriously gorgeous. in the 3 hours we ran errands today she had 8 strangers make comments from 'hey pretty girl' to 'omg she's stunning'. i just smile and say thank you and try to say thing like 'she's a super reader too' or something to change the subject. i know people mean well and i can't control their behavior but i worry about the effect it's already having on her. she frets about 'looking cool or pretty' everyday and even though i tell her looks aren't important and not to judge people by them, the entire rest or the world is calling me a liar. i just don't know how to handle it and i can see her diva behaviors starting to surface already. she's super intelligent and i want her to prize that over everything else and not get caught up in her looks. and i know i'm not being overly sensitive. i'll go out with my nieces or friends of my daughter who are adorable but they don't get the same kind of attention as she does. it's really awkward when she's out with other girls her age but she gets all the attention from people. i can't even think about life in 10 years......

tips and advice for potty training?	my 20 month old has really taken an interest in the toilet and our bathroom habits. he poops like clockwork every morning after his milk so i was wondering maybe it's time to potty train. do you think it's too early? i searched online for practical ways to potty train but most results came out not very detailed. i mean... do you hold his pee pee and go sssss ? lol ~ i have no idea! how do you do it??? after you sit him down on the potty, how does he know he has to poop? and when do you know he needs to go pee pee anyhow? do you think i should give it a go? or wait until he can talk and be able to tell me he needs to go? any advice is welcome!		/r/Mommit/comments/33cyi9/tips_and_advice_for_potty_training/	16	5	0	0.86	1429628041.0

ready for another baby, but my iud doesn't want to go! help!	we're ready for baby number two, but my iud strings have fled up into my uterus. i'm looking to hear from anyone who has been in this position, especially how they dealt with their insurance and billing. i've had my mirena iud for almost two years now. back when i first got it inserted, the strings were too long, and i think, in an attempt to help, my provider cut the strings almost flush against my cervix. now they can't be reached at all in the office, but an ultrasound shows the iud is still there. my only apparent option is to have a hysteroscopy as an outpatient procedure. iud removal should be covered by the women's health care act, but this will be coded as a hysteroscopy/d&c making me responsible for my deductible plus 20 percent. has anyone been able to get the iud out any other way or somehow reduce the cost of removal? i can ethically argue that this should be covered by the women's health care act, but i don't know who to argue this to. i'm considering postponing the procedure-- we need more time to save if it's going to cost me thousands to get pregnant! update i've scheduled an appointment with a different ob/gyn for this tuesday to see if he can retrieve it in office. for now, i've cancelled the or appointment and let my ob know i would only consider it as a last resort. the new one is willing to do it, so i'm crossing my fingers that it works. wish me luck! thanks so much for your advice! you guys gave me the confidence to explore other options.	taddymama	/r/Mommit/comments/33gzu0/ready_for_another_baby_but_my_iud_doesnt_want_to/	31	37	0	0.92	1429709089.0

i need help. is he teething?	please forgive any errors, i'm holding a crying baby. let's preface this, my son is not a crier. he crus when they stick needles in him, he cries when i use the booger sucker longer than 10 min. he cries when he wakes up and we ignore him for longer than 10 minutes . my son started crying last night and when i went to pick him up he was super warm. pulled out thermometer he's 100.7 . he's three months and 2 weeks. everyone is saying he's teething because he's been drooling alot this week. he sticks his hand in his mouth a lot i understand but he seems to also be very congested and having a lot of trouble breathing through his nose. i'm over dramatic so i always automatically assume the worst. i forced my husband to go to the er a month ago because i was positive he had measles. he didn't but i don't know if i'm assuming the worst because i'm a first time mom or if my child needs help. my mom told me he doesn't need the hospital but i'm just unsure and over stressed because he really doesn't cry inconsolably. anyone else have experience with this?

i'm lost with my two year old on discipline and bed time. please help.	hello! so my two year old is finally getting to the point where he needs to be disciplined. he throws, hits, swipes things off the counter, throws fits and my favorite, he has to go around the room and knock everything over. stools, chairs, tables, everything!!! i can't tell you how many times i've had to scrub my carpet because he knocks over a coffee, leason learned, must clean everything right away. we've tried saying no . we've always said we wouldn't be a family that yells, but thats pretty much all we do not. i even spanked him today, which i was always against. all he does is laugh. he doesn't understand punishment. we've tried a time out corner, he doesn't stay, he just giggles and tries to get away. i'm at a total loss. i have no idea what to do. nothing is working. i just don't think he understands that what he is doing is wrong. the other issue is night time. we co-slept until he was one and about 7 months ago, we transitioned him to his room. he now sleeps in there every night. he will not fall asleep unless one of us is in there with him. it could take 15 minutes, it could take two hours. if we try to leave before he falls asleep, we have a screaming child. we live in a condo and we have neighbors. we always plan on letting him cio, but after a couple minutes, i get nervous about the neighbors being woken up, so i go back in and put him down. i just had a baby 3 weeks ago, so this routine just will not work anymore. please help!!! how do i start disciplining a kid who thinks its hilarious when we're mad, and how the hell do i get him to sleep?! also, it's worth mentioning that these problems existed before having the second baby, so this isn't a result of a stressed out toddler, or at least it didn't start that way.	wandlore	/r/Mommit/comments/33wa7n/im_lost_with_my_two_year_old_on_discipline_and/	10	10	0	0.92	1430028393.0

looking for some advice and maybe a sub for this kinda thing?	ok so my 6 yr old son is what i would call a strong willed child. he pretty much always has been. this year starting kindergarten has been a nightmare for us, him, his poor teacher and his classmates and here is why. he hits his classmates , destroys their things , yells at them and is generally disrespectful. he disrespects and frustrates his teachers. to be honest most of this is probably because he is bored stiff . however learning to do what is instructed even when you don't want to is a valuable life lasson he seems he'll bent on not learning. he has had several incidences where we all have all scratched our heads wondering what to do. latest one was putting hand sanitizer in a classmates water bottle and when his teacher caught him he said straight up he wanted to poison her!!! i mean what the ever loving hell is he thinking!?!? we have him seeing a play therapist, a sensory specialist and are on the list to get a full psych eval done but their first opening is in september! i'm also trying to get in with a psychiatrist that our play therapist recommended. he isn't allowed to watch violent tv or play violent video games. his father and i have a loving stable relationship and there is no abuse of any kind happening . my question is are there any other moms who have dealt with a child with similar issues or is there a sub i could visit? any advice? i'm tearing my hair out because at home he's a much more controlled and happy child and he really is a sweet little boy. so gentle with is baby brother and loving to me and his dad. even his teacher has expressed disbelief at how he can be so sweet and so violent. i feel bad for him , bad for his teachers, bad for his poor classmates! sorry for the wall of text, any advice or stories of making it through a situation similar to this would be much appreciated! tl;dr son is having major issues at school, looking for advice.

not a mom but was hoping for some advice from some.	hi mommit! i babysit everyday for a three month little guy. i need some advice. he is always being held. there are enough people in his family that someone is constantly holding him. this makes it so i cannot put him down during the day. if i lay him down while he's asleep he wakes up and screams. i can't put him down so i can use the bathroom because he screams. i've learned the differences in his cries and these are distinctly angry. i've tried getting his attention with toys, music, talking to him, and singing. he doesn't stop until you pick him up. even then sometimes he still screams if you sit down with him or stop moving. any advice would be greatly appreciated. thanks!

my two year old has pretty much stopped eating. what can i do?	so my daughter has pretty much stopped eating the last few days. she'll usually eat her breakfast, which is peanut butter toast normally, but even that has started to dwindle. things we could count on her eating, like chicken strips, cheese and raspberries and such, she will no longer eat. she'll nibble once or twice and then just play around until we take it away. our tricks have stopped working too, like pretending to be lions or daddy's gonna eat it, and even bribing with dessert. i'm not sure what to do, i don't want her to starve herself. she drinks water throughout the day, and today and yesterday she's been really into milk as well. i always figured i'd be tough mom and if she refuses to eat then so be it, she'll get hungry eventually, but in reality i can't seem to do it. we just had a baby, so i don't know if she's just acting out or something, she's been really good with the baby and she hasn't seemed jealous or anything. any tips or advice? if i need to turn into tough mom i'll try, i just don't want her wasting away or something.	enb09	/r/Mommit/comments/35r3v9/my_two_year_old_has_pretty_much_stopped_eating/	15	21	0	0.87	1431463010.0

when did motherhood become all about looks?	i have lost 40lbs. in 3 months. thats 18kg. but im not proud. if anything, i feel more insecure than ever. i didnt post any pictures of my pregnancy because i was ashamed and embarrassed over how fast i was gaining weight, even though i was growing the most perfect little human inside my tummy. but now hes here, ive lost 40lbs, and im still ashamed. because of the navy, we will always live near a beach, which means that summertime becomes extra stressful to me with all the hype of working out like a maniac to get that hot beach body we all apparently need to fulfill our lives. i just cant do it anymore. i refuse to live with the stress of you will only be happy if youre thin and cover myself up with sleeved shirts and long skirts even though its about a million degrees outside. im still active and love being outdoors, i can play with both my baby and my dog, no problem, so why does it matter how much i weigh or what size clothes i wear? when there are pictures like the one of that super fit mom with three kids and crazy abs, saying whats your excuse? it doesnt feel like motivating motherhood, it feels more like shaming. i never looked like that, so i would be pretty shocked if i suddenly did, 4 months after having a baby. i will continue to try losing weight, but i am doing it so that i can fit into my pre-pregnancy clothes and not have to buy a completely new wardrobe, because honestly, i cant afford it. but my body has changed, and will never look like it did, but why the heck does that matter? i shouldnt have to cry and feel ashamed over petty things like my size when it created the most gorgeous jackpot genius baby the world has ever seen. when did motherhood become all about looks? actually, when did everything become all about looks?	misscongeniality	/r/Mommit/comments/36wvvo/when_did_motherhood_become_all_about_looks/	19	6	0	0.67	1432324819.0

if i could have your opinions as mothers on my experience it would be amazing! how do you feel about having to use restraints to get a medical exam done?	hello mothers of mommit! i know there have been a few threads dealing with something similar, but i feel like none of them have been directly relatable to my experience as they didn't really involve the use of active restraints. i know it seems silly, but it would be incredibly helpful to me personally if i could hear some other mothers opinions on my experience. im sorry if it offends anyone. if you choose to read, thank you, from the bottom of my heart for letting me talk about this! well, i was very sensitive, and shy, and afraid of getting my testicles checked when i was little. my mom tried to explain how important they were, but i never really felt there was anything wrong with them, just that they were really sensitive, and not something i ever wanted anyone to look at, or touch. i put up enough resistance to the idea that my mom didnt outright make me, because my doctor agreed that we could put it off. which to my young mind meant we could put it off forever, but at one point that changed. one of the pivotal points was that i played football at school. because of that eventually it came time for the boys to get their sports physicals done. well, i never imagined that something like a testicle check would be involved in such a setting, so it caught me pretty off guard when at the end of the physical the doctor told me to pull my underwear down. naturally i refused, and my mom ended up having to come to the school to try and talk me into it. but i couldnt imagine doing it, even though she said something like, this is your last chance to get this over with right now, this is completely ridiculous. we can go home right now without doing it, but you're going to have to get checked later, and it's going to be much worse... but i was so frightened i did the opposite of what she wanted and just agreed to getting checked later, imagining she was bluffing. afterwards i just wanted to forget the whole ordeal. that worked out ok for about a week., and then my mom took me to this new doctor's office without really telling me what we were going for. eventually i became curious while we were waiting, and asked my mom what we were at this doctor for. my mom decided to be bluntly honest with me and said, they specialize in checking boys' testicles here, and dealing with uncooperative, sensitive boys. i turned pale and couldn't even move...and barely managed to ask something like, why are we here though? in a daze even though i knew the answer. and my mom told me well, last week you didn't want to get your testicles checked at the school, which would have been very quick and easy, so we need to get you checked today. i wanted to run away very badly, but i somehow couldn't move from my chair, and pretty shortly after they called my name. a nurse took us to the exam room and did some basic diagnostics. i managed to relax a little bit, though not much. eventually the doctor came in, and she was actually pretty nice. there was no preface to anything really because i was only there for one thing though, so she was just kind of immediately like hello, so you're here for a testicle check. let's get started. are you willing to cooperate today? or do you want to be on the table? despite being petrified, i couldn't cooperate. her and my mom offered me the cooperation option of pulling my own underwear down probably a dozen times, but i just hoped they would stop asking and i could go home without getting checked like usual, so i just shook my head and was silent. so then the doctor made a call, and two nurses came in and stood beside me and the doctor explained that i could voluntarily get on the exam table, or they could forcibly put me on there. i chose to voluntarily do it since i could see how it would end...and i had flashbacks to being held down before by my mom. it was pretty awful though. once i lay on the exam table i realized there were restraints on it. the two nurses strapped my arms and legs and torso down, and then exited the room. meanwhile my mom and the doctor were just chatting, and my mom was like why do you think he hates having his testicles checked so much? he was really ridiculous at the school physical. i just don't understand it. and the doctor was just kind of casually saying something like, well, it happens, some boys are more shy and sensitive than others and have a harder time cooperating with these checkups than other boys. it's perfectly fine, and normal, that's what we're here for. she and my mom then approached me and my mom told me to calm down because the school requires it, and the state requires it, it's not that bad to get your testicles checked, all boys have to get it done. she then put her hand on mine, while the doctor told me what she would be doing. which was almost awful in itself...hearing her just calmly, like sweetly say ok, so just try to relax ok. i know you don't like getting your testicles checked, but that's what we're here for today. i'm just going to pull your underwear down, and do the checkup real quick ok? i will be really fast, and you will be fine, i promise. but i was not fine. i hated the feeling of not being able to move at all, or do anything as i felt her pulling my underwear down. and there was a very long pause before she actually touched me. i was just lying on the exam table, unable to move in front of my mom and the doctor... waiting for the worst thing ever. and it was really intense. i strained against the restraints when she finally touched me and started crying. but at least it did get over with somewhat quickly. unfortunately she thought she felt something on one of my testicles and had to go back and feel it again... turned out to be a benign lump. but it was awful hearing her tell me she needed to take one more feel after thinking it was over with, and it wasnt any easier the second time she touched me. then she pulled my underwear up, told me i had been a very good boy, and that i was healthy, and that she was proud of me, while letting me out of the restraints. by that time i definitely regretted not just getting checked at school. but it was obviously way too late for such thoughts. ive never really been able to forget about it. i still wonder if it was really something my mom needed to do? was it good that she made me get checked? was it really so important she needed to resort to restraints? why didnt she care more about how sensitive i was? i know it was an important checkup, but how do other mothers feel about this? would most mothers have taken me to that same doctor? or would they have just let it go? was the use of restraints justified? how do mothers feel about having to use them? admittedly, after that i cooperated every year at my physicals when it came time for the testicle check. but going through it still affects me. it would be great to hear what other mothers perspective on it is. thank you again to all of your wonderful mothers who have taken the time to read my story, i sincerely appreciate it!

advice re 10-week-old and self soothing for naps. too young?	i am a new mom with a 10-week-old boy. i have been reading 'healthy sleep habits, happy baby' and have been working on getting my son to sleep a bit more. right now he only sleeps about 8-10 hours per day total. we started doing a bedtime routine and he can now self-soothe to sleep in his bassinet in our room at around 10pm. we just switched from swaddling to a grobag. he sleeps for about 5 hours before waking to feed and then after that is up again after 1.5-2 hours. he usually falls asleep in the swing during breakfast and when that happens, i turn the swing off and let him sleep. for the remainder of the day, when he seems to be getting tired, i try to put him in his crib for a nap. he is unable to self soothe to sleep. if i let him fall asleep in my arms and then place him in the crib, he wakes and cries after only a few minutes. i pick him up until he is calm and drowsy and then place him back in the crib. before he even reaches the mattress, he starts to get upset. i try to extend the number of minutes each time before i go in to soothe but i cannot get him to sleep and then it's feeding time again . is it too early to start this process for naps? did anyone follow this book with good success at this age? at this age, will he learn this early that if he complains enough i will pick him up and develop bad habits? thanks	dkittyg	/r/Mommit/comments/37h7q8/advice_re_10weekold_and_self_soothing_for_naps/	9	0	0	0.5	1432745091.0
how to brush/floss a toddler's teeth	ha! you thought this was going to be a comic, didn't you? our pediatric dentist showed me how to brush my two year old's teeth recently as his teeth were beginning to show the beginning signs of decay. before this visit, i had been doing the ol' headlock, which he didn't appreciate at all. now i lay him down on his back, put his head between my thighs, and put my legs over his arms. then i brush his teeth while he screams. it looks and sounds like torture, but the funny thing is my kid now hands me his toothbrush and assumes the position on his own while we're getting ready in the morning/evening. he still cries, and i laugh at him, and then he laughs at himself. but at least his teeth aren't gross anymore and the whole damn ordeal is over in a minute. anyway, just wanted to share with some fellow mamas who might be struggling with this!	musicalnix	/r/Mommit/comments/37iq78/how_to_brushfloss_a_toddlers_teeth/	25	52	0	0.95	1432766602.0

need advice to help baby with dad	hi mommit - i'm a first time mom and have an 8 week old daughter. she's a pretty easy baby for the most part, but does have her witching hour in the evenings. i'm on maternity leave for 12 weeks, and afterwards my husband is going to stay home with her for 5 weeks until our daycare starts. right now, and for the last week or so, she's been having a real problem with him holding her in the evenings. she'll be fine when i have her, but when i hand her over, she becomes irate and will even start full-on crying. as soon as he hands her back, she's fine again. this is really starting to wear on him. he understands intellectually that i'm the milk truck, so she's responding to that more than anything, but it's really hurting his feelings. i've been trying more and more to pass her off to him once she's fed and happy, and let them have a chance to breathe once the crying starts without my input . does anyone have any advice? i really hope we can get something in place to make his time at home with her fun and not something that he is dreading.

7.5 month old hates her cot, advice?	hey there mommit, i'm looking for advice. my little girl is 7.5 months old and in the last week has refused to sleep in her cot. basically as soon as she lays down in it she starts to cry, and it only gets worse and worse until i pick her up. we've never been into letting her cry it out, and i know that it's not recommended for her age anyway, nor is changing our approach to such things, nor do i want to do it that way. i've tried putting her into her cot and sitting with her and reading to her before she's actually asleep, but she still just cries more and more intensely. at this stage overnight she's laying on me while i slog through till morning, when her daddy gets up and then she and i catch some sleep in bed together and start all over again. he's a sweetheart and offers to get up and give us the bed, but he needs rest too so i insist he get some sleep time overnight. the only way i can get her in her cot at this stage is when she is fully asleep on me, and half an hour later she's screaming anyway. anyone else go through this? what did you do? she'll let me lay her on the couch next to me while i sit up overnight, but just loses her baby shit when she's laid in her cot. please help this very tired mum!	elephant_earthship	/r/Mommit/comments/37zro9/75_month_old_hates_her_cot_advice/	7	2	0	1.0	1433102241.0
help me with my climbing sleep stealer!!	my 20 month old daughter has been climbing since before she could walk and has always been into absolutely everything. she's now mastered climbing out of her crib and dropping to the floor. putting her to bed at night has become a battle because she just repeatedly climbs out unless i sit in there until she's sound asleep and scold her whenever she starts to climb. the worse part is that she's went from almost always sleeping through the night to sneaking out of her crib at all hours to get into whatever she can get into. i'm getting pretty much no sleep and i'm functioning on a zombie level. does anyone have any suggestions to get her to stop this?	mandaj13	/r/Mommit/comments/38ae7u/help_me_with_my_climbing_sleep_stealer/	4	7	0	1.0	1433285187.0

baby/toddler introduction and next few days advice?	we are due to give birth to our second child any day now. our plan is to have a grandparent stay with our 2 year old and bring her to the hospital after the baby is born to introduce them. we hadn't really considered anything other than having the grandparents stay at our house with her during that time. yesterday my mom offered to come pick up my daughter and keep her at her house for a few days so we can bring home the baby, rest and not have to worry about a toddler running around either. she lives 2 hours away from us, and my daughter likes going to visit her. would that be a good idea or not? part of me says that's a super offer, while the other part of me says we want our daughter home to get used to having the baby around too. my husband is concerned that she might feel like she's getting replaced at home by the baby if we send her away right after the baby is born. do you guys have any thoughts of considerations?	sarabara82	/r/Mommit/comments/39rro6/babytoddler_introduction_and_next_few_days_advice/	5	11	0	1.0	1434251080.0
anyone ever hire a nanny? how did you find them and how did you know you had the right person?	hi all, i am a ftm due in 10 days! i am trying to figure out what we are doing for childcare when i go back to work in about 11 weeks at this point. daycare isn't really an option, as i work in an er which is 12 hour shifts, often on weekends, and my husband has an erratic, unpredictable schedule with very long hours. our closest family is 2 1/2 hours away and unable to help. we have discussed our options, which seem to be limited to hiring someone to come to the house. this would be ideal as the dogs could be taken care of as well. we are able to afford to pay between $15-20/hr depending on if they help out with cleaning as well. as i said in the title, how did you find someone, and what criteria were important to you? i have been searching on care.com, but am having trouble finding someone who can do up to 12 or 13 hours at a time, even thought it would never be more than 12-13 days per month. edit formatting	cebeat	/r/Mommit/comments/39uauk/anyone_ever_hire_a_nanny_how_did_you_find_them/	12	2	0	1.0	1434315649.0
diaper brand suggestions?	we've been using walmart brand diapers. they're cheap and had the wetness indicator for us newbie parents. however, it's gotten to the point that diaper blow outs is just an inevitability. every time he poops. every. time . now, i'm not sure if this is normal but i somehow doubt it. my son is 6 months. we tried cloth diapering but it didn't work out which is a bummer since i was really looking forward to it. we're also more confident in knowing when his diaper is wet so we really don't need the indicator anymore. any recommendations on a good diaper? my son has really chunky legs and a small waist. the waist never seems tight enough because the poop always squeezes out the back edit additional information, he's 18 pounds and in size 3 which is supposed to be for babies 16-25 pounds i think? my husband wants to try a bigger size but i'm not sure that's the problem. edit looks like the walmart brand is out. definitely going to look into different brands and a size up.	therapistiscrazy	/r/Mommit/comments/39xy6e/diaper_brand_suggestions/	101	21	0	0.96	1434392820.0

moms who get esthestic services or love spa days, can i have your opinion on something?	hi there! i'm thinking about starting a business that caters to moms, but not solely to them. essentially my idea is a spa/salon that also has a child care facility either in it or directly attached to it. you can book your appointment, you show up and they take you away leaving your child/children in the capable hands of certified child care folk. the price of the child care is included in the cost of the spa treatment. the kid side of things would not be spa related, there would be games or toys etc. this is still in the its just an idea stage, but my questions to you are how often to moms want spa/beauty services and cannot because there is no one to watch their young ones? would a few extra dollars be a deal breaker when going to get those services? extra 10/20$? obviously this would target those moms who either dont have someone around to take the kids for the hour or two, or would be much easier for a drop-in. but this idea wouldnt necessarily be mutually exclusive. ie the child care could function on its own and so could the salon, but they would be an option for either.

trying the no-pants potty training method. tips/advice/tell me about your experiences?	so i'm taking a few minutes away from my daughter to ask for anyone experiences and hopefully get some tips. my daughter is 2 1/2, and we've been trying to potty train her since january. we've mostly just hoped she would kind of click into it, since my friends with similar aged children said that that's how it worked for them. well my stubborn child seems to be a-okay with wearing diapers for all eternity, so i've decided to go no-pants style. i read an article saying it was best for younger kids but i figure it should work for us. so far we've had two accidents, i bring her to the potty each time but we haven't had any pee make it into the actual bowl. we don't have a sit down toilet for her, we have one that goes over the toilet, but my place is very small so we don't need to go very far. i have it all set up in hopes she'll just boogy on over when she needs to go. i'm also doing this by myself, my husband is always busy on his days off so it's not really possible to stay home for three days with him. has anyone tried it by themselves? and with a baby? i'm hoping i haven't bit off more then i can chew. anyways if anyone can share their potty training stories i'd be very grateful!	enb09	/r/Mommit/comments/3abhk4/trying_the_nopants_potty_training_method/	8	10	0	1.0	1434655241.0

so i'm trying to come up with a schedule and the websites say that lo should be eating ~3 times a day! what the hell am i supposed to be feeding my 9mo-old?? 	first of all, she has no teeth yet. secondly, we've been ebfing with the addition of some baby-led weaning solids. i usually give her something to eat when we eat dinner, so far mostly vegetables but sometimes fruits . according to her diapers, she's not really chewing or digesting these. i find small chunks of whatever she ate. i am desperate to get her on some sort of schedule that doesn't involve her being tired and screaming for an hour every time i try to put her down for a nap. i need to have maybe an hour between 6am-8pm when i can eat or shower or wash diapers or clean clothes for us or research what the fuck am i supposed to be doing online, etc. the sample schedules i see say that babies her age should be eating solids 3-4 times every day. i can't even feed myself that many times! i don't know what i am doing. my husband is absolutely no help except to sneak her cow's milk or put me on the spot by trying to give her salty processed skillet meal stuff . i don't want to give her sugar until her birthday. according to what i've read, i'm also not supposed to give her milk, fish, egg whites, salt, butter, citrus, nuts, strawberries... the list goes on and on. i'm just trying to do what's right and best for her but i can't even figure out what that is! i don't know if anyone here can help me. i just feel like such an absolute failure. i feel so incredibly alone and overwhelmed. if anyone has even a helpful article to link me to, that would even be amazing as i just don't have the time or focus to be able to search thru the piles of nonsense on the internet... i don't mean to make you moms do my parenting for me. i just don't know where else to turn anymore. a million thanks.	knitB4zod	/r/Mommit/comments/3aeclg/so_im_trying_to_come_up_with_a_schedule_and_the/	27	22	0	0.93	1434718694.0
need advice- children/husband or social life priorities	tonight was a night that i get together with a group of women that i see bimonthly and we discuss books and life and we have brought our little kids since most of us have kids under 1. i am a sahm and this is something i look forward to since i am with my kids all the time. today was a rare occasion that my husband who usually stays with my toddler had to work and my normal babysitter was out of town, so i asked the host if i could bring her and keep her as occupied as possible with my tablet, she said yes. so i went with both kids , it wasn't ideal but it also could have been worse. when i got home another woman from the group sent a message that basically said no more kids and it made me feel terrible. this is the one thing i look forward to that i do for myself and now i am not sure if i want to be a part of it anymore. i love my kids and my life but it feels like i am being punished for this freak occation where i wanted to hang out with adults and didn't have a lot of options for people to watch my kids.	lil4268	/r/Mommit/comments/3ahk63/need_advice_childrenhusband_or_social_life/	7	5	0	0.79	1434781136.0
those whose kids have had hand, foot, & mouth, i have a couple questions about your experience.	parents who have dealt with this disease, what do you think? we noticed the rash on my 20mo old on saturday, and it spread the most on sunday and is already in retreat. we took her to the doctor on monday and received the diagnosis, but even then she didn't have a fever. she is not prone to fever though. the highest she's ever read is 99.5 and typically registers 97.5. she has had a runny nose since last week, so i had kept her away from kids the whole week before. since the incubation period is 3-6 days i'm honestly confused how/when she got it, or what would be considered the day it started. in retrospect, she was grumpy last week, but we had chalked it up to her runny nose. anyways, the doctor said it's contagious roughly a week but mainly when she's feverish, but she wasn't even feverish at the doctor. then when i tried to get clarity through google i only got more confused because it says it can be contagious for weeks after. so how long am i supposed to keep her away from other kids? until the rash goes away? has anyone experienced their kid getting someone else sick weeks later? this leads to my second problem. she was also diagnosed with an ear infection and is taking her first antibiotics ever for it. the problem is she won't take it. she spits it out everywhere and screams and fights. she's always been a champ about tylenol, so all i can think is this is really gross and/or it hurts her mouth sores. she fought so hard last night she made herself throw up. any tips for getting this medicine in her? 	megalynn44	/r/Mommit/comments/3az21r/those_whose_kids_have_had_hand_foot_mouth_i_have/	15	12	0	0.88	1435166725.0
does anyone have a bob stroller wheel? kind of a funny story...	we went to take my son for a walk and my husband decided to walk up to the cliff at the park first. i held the baby because i have a fear of heights and just knew he would fall off to his doom. well, the front tire came off and fell into the river! it was at least 50 feet down. we ran to the end where all the trash gathers and tried to get the tire but we couldn't find it. i insisted my husband and step father go back and try to retrieve the tire together later that evening since i had the baby and could help and those suckers are $100 to replace. well, they go back with a fishing pole, find it and somehow jar it loose while trying to retrieve it. the tire is gone. i looked on craigslist and found a double stroller for $75 in really shitty condition and picked it up so i could have a tire.my single stroller was already pretty old, but it worked. so, i put the front wheel on the single and went for a run. a month later, the tube blows and we find out we are pregnant with 2. i love my stroller but i think it's cursed. anyways, if anyone has a front tire for the sport utility or a jogging stroller they want to donate/sell in the dfw area let me know.		/r/Mommit/comments/3b2x51/does_anyone_have_a_bob_stroller_wheel_kind_of_a/	3	2	0	0.75	1435245235.0

sahm thinking about going back to college, any other moms have any advice?	a little background, i am a 32 year old sahm of two, but my youngest is getting ready to start kindergarten. i already have a bachelors in graphic design, but i never enjoyed it and over the 8 years that i have been home with my kids, i find that it will likely be difficult for me to ease back into that job field despite efforts to stay current in the various programs, etc. i have always enjoyed the medical field and i have been contemplating going back to college to pursue an associate degree in medical assisting. this would be so that i could work in a clinic setting and enjoy the more preferable daytime hours that many nurses do not get the luxury of enjoying . i would consider becoming a licensed practical nurse, but there aren't any colleges close by that offer it where i live, but they offer a cma program. i am terrified of going back because even for 45 hours of classes, it would cost a large amount of money . it may not seem like much, but it is something that i am really worried about. do any of you have experience with going back to college for a career change? is it worth it to put my family through this financial burden?	twd_throwaway	/r/Mommit/comments/3bjsjr/sahm_thinking_about_going_back_to_college_any/	46	23	0	0.97	1435608917.0
why have children if daycare is going to raise them?	i work for a very expensive private daycare, a distinction that is only important because we don't accept 4c. all of the families that send their children there are financially comfortable, so there is little need for both parents to work. i'm obviously not talking about single parent families that have to send their children to daycare during normal working hours because they're the sole provider, but why have children if you're going to put them in someone else's care from 7 30 in the morning to 6 30 at night? i am in charge of twelve one year olds and someone of them call me mama because they see me more during the week than their mothers or fathers. i know that there is no reason for someone to give up their career when their children are born, but if you're working eighty hours a week like some of my parents are, isn't having kids after the busy part of your career has passed more sensible? i'm not slamming people who have to work when they have kids; i am one of those people. i have two sons that go to school with me while i'm working. i'm just wondering why families that have the option to have a parent home part-time choose to put their children in daycare upwards of 50 hours a week?		/r/Mommit/comments/3bl1xz/why_have_children_if_daycare_is_going_to_raise/	46	0	0	0.38	1435630875.0

moms of reddit, what should i buy my brother's first child?	i crossed baby clothes off the list since that seems to be the main thing that parents tend to get too much of . i don't have any children, so i need some guidance. i thought about diapers, but they told me that they were gonna subscribe to something so that they get diapers delivered all year round . i thought about maybe some baby food making tools, but they're already buying a baby bullet. my brother's girlfriend's family is going to spoil this child for sure and i'm sure they'll get everything that they'll need, so i'm lost... i am all about education though, so i'm definitely sending some baby books. reading to your children is important! otherwise... idk. maybe i'll just do the easy thing and buy clothes. so, i've already added some things onto my wishlist on amazon diaper depot , teething necklace, some teething tablets to help for pain, and that stroller thing that was suggested to me. i'm still open to suggestions.		/r/Mommit/comments/3gid3z/moms_of_reddit_what_should_i_buy_my_brothers/	53	16	0	0.95	1439239983.0
please help me feel better about my 2.5 year old daughter refusing to be potty trained.	seriously. just when i thought i had the parenting down pat, my daughter, who is ridiculously bright, articulate, perceptive, and otherwise willing to act like a big girl, just flat-out throws a damned temper tantrum about having to use the potty. we have tried it all. bribing, taking away her diapers and making her run around bottomless, child-psychology, peer pressuring. all of it. i feel like there was a window of about 6 months right before she turned 2 when it would have been a perfect time to train her-- she was willing to please and in her mimicking phase. but everyone told me it was way too early. for the only time in my parenting life, i actually listened and felt bad that maybe i was rushing her out of my own convenience . now, we have a two-nager who is literally so soured on the idea that it has become a battle. the worst is that she's surrounded by people who won't force the issue, but instead indulge her dramatics, and she plays all of them to the hilt. it's so frustrating. help me feel better. when were your children potty trained? how can i convince her? what worked for you??	andgivethecataname	/r/Mommit/comments/3gis1h/please_help_me_feel_better_about_my_25_year_old/	22	11	0	0.84	1439246706.0

nipple sizes and spit up. mom's of reflux babies, advice please?	my 6mo has reflux. not terrible, but just lots and lots and lots of spit up. we've been using dr. brown's since birth. he's still on a size 1 nipple, because it seems every time we test the size 2, the spit up increases. however, as of late, his spit up seems to be increasing. could having a nipple that's too small be causing spit up? is there a different kind of bottle you'd recommend? seriously, any advice with this is appreciated. i'm getting tired of the constant catch the puke game. note the only place he doesn't spit up is his crib. it's bizarre. everywhere else is spit-up city, especially his exersaucer .	orange1983	/r/Mommit/comments/3hmqxo/nipple_sizes_and_spit_up_moms_of_reflux_babies/	16	14	0	1.0	1440016714.0

how do you handle 24 month tantrums?	my almost 2 year old daughter has begun throwing some serious crying tantrums lately and as first time parents, we don't really know how to respond. she was such a good baby and never cried so when she throws crying fits, i feel bad for her. take last night for example, she needed to take a bath so i got the bath going, she put her colored tabs in to color the water and that is usually the time i sneak off her clothes. i tried to put her in the tub and she just freaked out and stood there crying for like 10 minutes because she wanted her skirt back. i sat next to her and just comforted her and tried to keep her in the tub, thinking that she would ultimately calm down but after 10 minutes of crying really hard and trying to climb out i got a towel and took her out. she put her same clothes from before back on and she was fine. the entire time i just kept saying calmly and touching her that she needs to calm down, and that she won't get what she wants until she calms down. i feel like i failed because i took her out of the tub and she ultimately cried until she got what she wanted. my husband just had a similar thing this morning where she wanted to wear some new socks i guess and they needed to be washed first because they were brand new. any ideas or suggestions?	muksak	/r/Mommit/comments/3iqb85/how_do_you_handle_24_month_tantrums/	20	19	0	1.0	1440772368.0

how much independent play should i encourage? 	my baby girl is 3 months old and has been pretty independent from birth. she loves cuddles and attention but also loves to be left to play alone . the older she is getting, the more and more happy she is just entertaining herself on her play mat etc. the moment she gets bored or wants something she tells me, and i regularly sit next to her and ask her what she is doing, chat to her etc... but then leave her too it. however, am i giving her too much independent play time? it seem to be a couple of hours a day overall on a 'good' day. she only wants to be held for cuddles when she is tired, and in the evenings. its great to be able to have my hands free to get some house work done, but i read that at 6 months you should be able to get 15 minutes at a time and more as they grow older.... but i'm getting up to a hour . is this too much? or am i just really lucky? the moment she grizzles or just seems tired or bored i pick her up etc	Dinosauriformes	/r/Mommit/comments/3khrd5/how_much_independent_play_should_i_encourage_3/	3	3	0	0.81	1441939675.0

what would you do another mom grabbed my daughters arm, twisted it and she fell!	this is something that happened yesterday that has really been bugging me. baby girl did the advanced gymboree class at first i was nervous because all the other kids were walking and she's barely crawling and standing on her own. luckily, she was able to keep up with the older kids. while the kids were playing, there was this 12 month old girl laying on the ground. my girl went up to her and put her hand on her face. didn't grab just kind of started to pat her face. almost instantly, the mother grabbed my daughter's hand, twisted her arm and she fell to the floor. i was so mad but because we were basically visitors, i didn't want to cause a scene. i let it play out until my girl fell to the floor. luckily she didn't cry and wasn't phased. the mother apologized and i said quietly, yeah, don't ever grab my kid again. and picked up my girl and walked away. how would you have handled this situation? i have never been in this situation before so i wasn't sure what to do. i was so mad and should have said, hey! relax! don't grab by daughter. but i didn't want to be rude because it was our first class. i am sure there will be many more times like this but i was ready to unleash my momma bear instincts.		/r/Mommit/comments/3mqass/what_would_you_do_another_mom_grabbed_my/	56	36	0	0.86	1443464733.0

where do you shop for dresses and outfits for your teenage daughter for more formal events?	my daughter is 14 years old and just got a beta invite. her grandmother usually handles the clothes shopping department but she's on an extended vacation, and my daughter needs a dress. she's about 5'9 , slim, track runner... if anyone knows of any awesome online boutiques or has any other suggestions, i'd like to find her 5-10 casual/business casual dresses or blouse/skirt combos she can wear to more formal events looking for dresses that are ok to wear to school, not club-like stuff. i've looked at the major stores, but i'm having an issue filtering out what is meant for older women and what is for young teens. she doesn't want to look like a toddler dressed up for church, but she's modest and just wants to be stylish and classy...and i'd like to reward her taste and modesty by getting her stuff that looks good and that she loves. any direction would be greatly appreciated!

does anyone have any experience with a nanny? i have a... strange question.	my husband, daughter, and i live with my best friend and her 4 children. my husband, best friend, and i all have full time jobs. my husband started in mid september working from 6 00 am to 5, myself the end of september working 8 00 am to 5 00, and her, today , working from 12 30 pm to about 9 pm. her brother came and moved in to be our nanny/manny, taking care of children, 1 y/o, 2 y/o, a 5 y/o, and a 9 y/o. the children are cared for by my friend and then from 12 00 to 5 00, he watches 2-4 kids, depending on the time they get home from school. my husband and i moved in 2 months ago. we have cleaned every day since moving in, even when we started working, when she didn't/wouldn't. even staying up later than her to clean. even when she fell asleep in the recliner in the living room. we have folded her childrens clothes, finished her projects, and even washed and folded her clothes. she has done the same for us, but, again, we were working. she was not. the deal was that by the time she started working, what she had been working on would be done so her brother/nanny could take over. it was not done. yesterday, i got off work late, at 6, and arrived home to the kids sitting at the table in the dark coloring, with my daughter in her high chair sitting in a diarrhea diaper while he was watching tv. i came home from work early today at 12 30 to find him watching tv on the couch, with breakfast dishes still on the table, food in the floor, and the house... well... just generally the same pigsty it has been for a week now, plus his mess. my daughter was down for a nap. he was still on the clock, ' so i used the time to go run errands. i returned at 3, to find the same mess not picked up, my daughter running around in our bedroom, closed in, and unable to get out. she had been through a bag and dumped the contents out, carried items around the room, and had made a mess. she had on another dirty diaper. it was evident she had been awake for a while. he told me that i woke her up when i came in at 3 and shut the front door. she has no contract with him and neither do i. we are supposed to tally his hours at the end of the week, divide it into 4ths, and i pay 1/4th to him. however, i already do not feel comfortable with this arrangement. what would you do??		/r/Mommit/comments/3nwgo4/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_a_nanny_i/	40	22	0	1.0	1444258753.0

how has your relationship with your so changed after having baby 1? i'm 20wks pregnant and am extremely worried about it.	we've been together for 7 years and it's always just been the two of us. children were always planned when the time was right, and here we are with our first daughter due in march. our relationship has always been something special. we talk about absolutely everything, nothing is sacred and he always knows instantly if something is wrong. i have no reason to believe that anything would change, we are both really excited about the baby, in a fantastic place financially, on the same page on the ways we want to parent, already work well at home together but i just can't shake this worrying feeling that somehow our child is going to be the reason we grow apart. am i alone in the way that i'm feeling or did anyone else have these thoughts? i have talked to him about it and he says that these thoughts are silly, nothing is going to change between us, don't stress yourself out etc. i do believe that he means this, but i worry that he says it because he doesn't know how much work a baby is going to be. things are just so good now and i can only hope that it gets even better, because i am so scared to lose the person i love so much. edit i wanted to clarify that i do understand and expect change i am more wondering how that change impacted your relationship.	totes_wife_material	/r/Mommit/comments/3oeino/how_has_your_relationship_with_your_so_changed/	28	24	0	1.0	1444616138.0
why does my son still have a runny nose?!	my son is one year old and he's had a runny nose and has been sneezing for a month now. i took him to the dr a few weeks ago and they said it was a cold that should clear up soon. he's not cranky, he doesn't have a fever, the boogers are clear. they said it can't be allergies cuz he's too young. i feel bad cuz i'm constantly wiping his nose and i'm always covered in boogers lol. husband says not to take him to the dr again so i figured i'd try to see what other moms have dealt with something like this. sometimes i get better answers than a dr gives. also he's getting a top tooth way in the back, maybe that's causing it. any input would be greatly appreciated!	kitkatkelly_	/r/Mommit/comments/3okyz2/why_does_my_son_still_have_a_runny_nose/	24	11	0	0.84	1444741608.0
advice for 2.5 year old with hfm	okay, so i wasn't sure if this is the right spot to ask for advice on dealing with a sick child. if this is inappropriate, i will take it down. but i'm asking for help from all of you mommas out there that have had a child that got hand foot and mouth. my son caught this stupid thing while we were on vacation i took him to the walk in clinic thursday evening because he was puking, had a temp of 101.1, and i had just found all these tiny bumps everywhere. the doctor was honestly not very helpful. she tested him for strep, and when that came back negative, she told me that he had hfm. my main concern is to find out when i should bring him back in if he isn't getting better, and how to not have his illness spread to his twin sisters, who are only 4 months old. all she told me is that it spreads like a cold, which in my experience, means that everyone is going to get it. another thing i would really like some advice on is that he seems more his cheerful self but his rash is spreading everywhere and i don't know what i can do to help alleviate it if its' bothering him. he is my oldest baby, and this is the first time hes been really sick, and my mom is currently out of state taking care of her mom, so i'm at a complete loss at what to do for him. please help this momma out!!! thank you so much for your time!!!! <3 <3 <3	meganmaxinenicole	/r/Mommit/comments/3p8kj7/advice_for_25_year_old_with_hfm/	12	13	0	1.0	1445183490.0
how do you pick a doctor?!	i apologize if this isn't the appropriate place, but i couldn't find any place that was better. /r/obgyn seemed to be mostly inactive, but i'd love to find a better place if this isn't it! anyway, my husband and i have been married for almost 3 years, we found out last week we're pregnant. i have to jump through some hoops since my medical provider is tricare, so i went and had an official pregnancy test taken so it can be on the books. they handed me this enormous packet full of all the obgyns my insurance covers and good lord, where do i start? for what it's worth i'm 28, this is our first child and i've seen obgyns before but only for well woman exams so most issues didn't really pertain to me because it was mostly in and out exams, but now i have so many things to consider. we're located in oklahoma but we're not oklahoma natives, all my go-to doctors are 1,200 miles away! my gp will probably see me once before they pass me off to a more specialized doctor, but i just don't know who that will be! i've already narrowed down my gigantic friggin list to a handful of doctors but i'm having trouble finding reviews for some of them online. i've tried yelp, google reviews, healthgrades, is there somewhere i'm missing? i'd really appreciate any help at all since i'm just stumbling through blindly.	hyperventilate	/r/Mommit/comments/3pabph/how_do_you_pick_a_doctor/	21	4	0	1.0	1445210850.0

how should i regulate nap time?	my 2yo quickly went from 2 naps to 1 earlier this year and has been fine with it until recently. about the last month or so she still naps, but she'll go down at about 1pm and let me tell you..this girl likes her sleep. she'll easily sleep 3-4 hours just for her nap alone 80% of the time. my issue with it is she doesn't always fall right asleep and her bedtime for the night is 8pm and don't want her sleeping so long so close to bedtime. how should i work this? should i try to pull her nap time earlier? like slowly move it back to noon or 11am? she gets up at 8am every day bright eyed and bushy tailed, sleeps her solid naps, gets up and sleeps all through the night. or should maybe i shorten her naps? i really hate being woke up and don't wanna do the same to her, but if it gets us into a better sleep schedule i just might.

my friend is pregnant- what are some things you wish you had gotten during your pregnancy?	i posted this on two x chromosomes but i think this sub may be more appropriate. &nbsp; i have a friend of 12 years who is only a few months pregnant. i just lost my job and also, just got an awesome job which pays $5 more/hour. yay! &nbsp; i'm interested in getting her a few things, as she isn't super close with her family or future in-laws, and i generally like to spoil people. i picked up some gender neutral items for the baby that i thought she might appreciate, but i think i'm going to hold off on more baby products until she's further along . &nbsp; so is there anything anyone wishes they would have gotten during their pregnancy? for example, any specific brands of tea, lotion, anything really. i personally never plan on having kids, i never even planned to have a boyfriend or be married or anything, so i've never looked into or asked about this before xd i also don't know if there are any products which should be avoided during pregnancy. for example, my ex sister-in-law didn't use hair dye, hair products like hairspray, or nail polish. but i don't know exactly why or what else. &nbsp; also, online articles haven't been helpful thus far, so figured i'd try asking for direct advice from those who have been there, or know someone close who has. edit i should also note, my friend is having a complicated pregnancy so far. i don't remember the exact condition she was diagnosed with, but in a nutshell, she can't consume anything without throwing up. it should be something pretty consistent throughout her pregnancy. i don't know why this would matter, but i just figured i'd put it out there.	queequeg092S	/r/Mommit/comments/3qaq4j/my_friend_is_pregnant_what_are_some_things_you/	14	3	0	1.0	1445877100.0

3mo wants to comfort suck at all times. what is this?	so i have a pretty happy baby overall, not too difficult outside of normal stuff like growth spurts, etc. which are always hell anyhow. she just turned 3 months this past friday and for the past 2-3 weeks she's been wanting to be latched on to comfort suck at all times. for a week there she even wanted to be latched on all night. if you take her off, she cries. she won't go to sleep any other way without extreme unhappiness and the only way to get a break is to wait until she's really asleep and give her to her dad for some time . she keeps shoving her hands in her mouth, and everything else, and is constantly frustrated that it's not satisfying. the only thing that satisfies her is being on the breast. when on the breast to eat, she is often distracted, looking around. i have to use a swaddle cloth to abstruct her view, to which she responds with frustrated crying and then finally eating. we thought that maybe she's teething early so we got her some teething toys. those don't catch her attention or satisfy her for more than a couple minutes, and she gets mad at them in the end and cries in frustration. nothing solves this oral fixation except being on the breast. we've tried pacifiers and she won't take them. she cries in the car seat, and she cries in the stroller, both because she wants to be on the breast . i want to nurture her so i have been letting her stay latched on as long as she wants, but it has become an issue because she does not go into a deep sleep while actively sucking. this results in an overtired baby, and an overtired baby wants to nurse and sleep so she cries. we're going nuts. any ideas what this is about? if you went through something similar, how did you deal with it?	nomad891	/r/Mommit/comments/3qgsmz/3mo_wants_to_comfort_suck_at_all_times_what_is/	19	7	0	0.78	1445977511.0

repost from twoxchromosomes. thought it may have more first person advice here.	new redditor here. i've lurked for a long time but i just wanted to come here and vent and get some unbiased opinions. let me give some back story. i am an almost 30 year old, married to a great guy, wonderful career, nice home, and have a three year old. my pregnancy with her was planned, but i was very sick the entire time and then had a very difficult postpartum period which was only made worse by my baby's colic and my undiagnosed hypothyroidism. i felt like i was dying. needless to say, my husband and i decided i couldn't put myself through that ever again. although i wanted that child with every fiber of my being, i often regretted what she did to my life/marriage/job/sanity. becoming a mother changes everything in your life. but i made the choice to have her, and i appreciated that she was a happy child and healthy. i have had a lot of anxiety and possible depression since i had had her, but i felt like that was resolving as she and i learned to enjoy one another and she was becoming more independent. during my pregnancy with her, i begged my husband for a vasectomy. hormonal birth control made me even more anxiety ridden and felt like i was on my period all the time. he thought i would change my mind and that i would want another baby once our first was older. i begged him for almost four years. well wouldn't you know it? he gave in. he agreed life was peachy again and that he would get one. we found out i was pregnant the week he decided i was serious. i was 4 weeks along at that time. i am now 20 weeks pregnant. i cried for weeks. i cried until the vomiting started. i got on some really awesome medications that make life livable again, but i was practically bedridden for three months. family was told i was pregnant and were delighted. friends found out and told me everything would work out. i wanted an abortion, but never have known anyone who had one and didn't even know how i would get through it. i never brought it up to my husband, i think it would have broken his heart. i kept thinking i would grow attached to this child or suddenly want it as the pregnancy progressed. everyone around me with an unexpected pregnancy acts happy about it. are they lying? is there some female gene i'm missing that makes me feel this way? my mother asked if i were depressed this weekend and i told her, i don't believe not wanting a baby and then getting pregnant and not being happy about it is depression. i believe i really didn't want a baby and still don't want a baby. no one understands. my mother has offered to adopt it, but i just don't know how i'd ever live through the guilt of that. it was by my own fault that this has happened and i am an adult who should be able to deal with it. shouldn't i? i was at work today and my boss said that she felt sorry for my baby. that she thought it wouldn't feel loved. that hit me hard and was in my opinion, completely inappropriate as she doesn't know me at all . i didn't lash out, but i asked her matter of factly what her suggestion was to deal with it. i told her maybe there are other women who become pregnant unexpectedly and just lie about how excited they are. is that the case? or am i a retched human being who should give this child to my mother because i won't give it adequate love? it should be noted that my husband and my entire family are extremely supportive of me and really fill in any blanks i leave in the love department. they have for my first child, and they have promised to for this child. i will admit that i am an extremely pragmatic individual and have never been a very warm or affectionate type. i feel as if i can't connect to people or my children and have a hard time showing love, even when i know for a fact i love someone and couldn't live without them. if you have any experience or ideas on how i could change that, i would be open to it as well. i am completely closed off and have been for 5+ years. thank you for any insight. i just want to feel like someone understands me.	not_me87	/r/Mommit/comments/3qmznh/repost_from_twoxchromosomes_thought_it_may_have/	15	3	0	0.71	1446078700.0
i know this is a wall of text, but i really need some advice on how to go forward with my situation.	first off, i am on my cell, so if this format is horrendous, or if auto correct is terrible please just tell me and i'll grab my laptop and fix it. okay, so i'm going to start at the begining and lead up to today's events please bear with me, i know i'm going to get very emotional, and i'm trying to keep my thoughts together but they just seem to be all over the place. i had a fantastic mother in law. i know it's unheard of, but she was wonderful to me and to my son. she loved him to the moon and back, went to his baby shower, his first birthday party. on his first halloween she insisted on carving a pumpkin so he could sit in it and she could take his picture. and she was so elated to have granddaughters. i should elaborate a little more and tell you that she was actually my husbands step mom, not his bio mom. she was never able to have children of her own because when she was 20 she had cervical cancer and everything was taken out so prevent it from spreading. so my husband and my kids were almost like her kids. she always yearned for a baby, and she got them through me. about 2 weeks after i found it my twins were girls, she found out the reason that she had been so sick over the past couple of years is because she had lung cancer. stage four. she told us at the end of january, she died at the beginning of march. my girls were born at the end of may and we named one of them in her honor. i'm still not over it. everytime i think about it too much my throat closes up and i just can't help but cry and cry. fast forward to today. my father in law has a new girlfriend, which apparently isn't unheard of when your spouse dies and you liked being married. my husband and i just want him to be happy of course, he was also involved in my son's life, although not so much in my girls life, but i had forgiven him for that and just figured he was dealing with his grief. well, we went to lunch to meet his girlfriend, and we take our 2 year old son and 5 month old twin girls. i was a little nervous, as i always am when meeting someone new, a little excited thinking maybe we could rekindle our relationship with father in law, and start a relationship with his girlfriend, and feeling a little guilty because they thought crossed my mind that maybe my kids could have someone else to love and and be loved by since my mother in law died. we sat down and before we ordered our drinks they told us they were getting married in february. which we congratulated them, and are happy that father in law is happy, but honestly my heart sank for my deceased mother in law, even though i know it's ridiculous and i know she would want him to be happy, i'm just not at a good place when it comes to her death yet. but that's not why i'm asking for advice/support. i'm at a loss on what to do now because before we even got our food, this new girlfriend/soon to be wife told my husband and i that she absolutely did not like kids, and especially didn't like babies. she went into detail about how she never had a mothering instinct, and then told us she was sorry that we had twins, and she empathized with us, and did we really mean to have them so close together because she feels bad for us. his dad did not say a peep, and my husband and i just looked at each other dumbstruck. she also said a lot of just stupid things, like if i planned on having twins and that we shouldn't have anymore, and more on how much she just doesn't like kids. so all my hopes of having a cool new mother in law were dashed, and i honestly don't know if i ever want to even see her again since she has such loathing for my kids, and i don't know if i really want to talk to my father in law again, because we were under the impression that he really loved his grandkids to be honest i'm actually mad that he let his girlfriend talk to his son and daughter in law like that about his grandkids. my kids are the only grandkids he has, and he wasn't even phased that she hates kids- and he still has a 15 year old! my husbands youngest sibling is his sister, and she is still very much a kid. i just don't know what to think or do or say, and some guidance and insight would make my heart lighter. i know she didn't come out and say she specifically hated my kids, but she might as well have, and i'm at a loss on what to when think about that because this was the first time someone has ever told me they hated my kids without even knowing my kids. and that makes me cry to, because my kids are such beautiful individuals who all laugh and talk or gibber, their eyes will light up when they see someone they love, and i'm just crushed at what i feel was taken from them. first their grandy because of her too soon death and now i feel their grandpa since he has a super child free girlfriend. i know it's better for them to not have people like that in their life, but i still feel cheated and just upset. mommit, i am so sorry that i had such a wall of text, and if you read the whole thing a left me some advise/suggestions i am forever grateful. i have had a long day though, so i'm hitting submit, then going to sleep, and hopefully you guys can tell me if i'm just acting crazy, or if i have merit for my hurt feelings. i'll be on tomorrow after hopefully a good night's sleep and hopefully not as emotionally upset as i am right now, so i can have a clearer mind. tldr getting a new mother in law, and found out today she hates kids- especially babies. i have 1 toddler and 2 babies.	meganmaxinenicole	/r/Mommit/comments/3r6gvk/i_know_this_is_a_wall_of_text_but_i_really_need/	29	35	0	0.96	1446443684.0

could use a little advice mil is in hospital wearing a large neck brace . she has to lay flat on her back. should i take my 2yo to visit her or will it be too scary for him?	as far as my little one knows, his grandma is back home in another state after a 2 week visit with us. she was supposed to catch a flight home the other day but unfortunately fell and broke a vertebra on her way to the flight. so she's stuck here in the hospital for a while. the visit to the hospital would be more to lift her spirits than for him to see her. i'm afraid seeing her flat on her back in a strange place with a huge neck brace & unable to move much will be traumatic for him but maybe not? what do you all think?? tia	meginmich	/r/Mommit/comments/3sg9mx/could_use_a_little_advice_mil_is_in_hospital/	2	2	0	0.75	1447275237.0

when to put a 7 week old on a schedule? and how?	so i'm a clueless ftm and my son just turned 7 weeks this past weekend. when do we start putting him on a schedule? right now he goes to bed around 9/10 and sleeps 5 hours, eats, sleeps till 6/7 and then wants to be back up again for a few hours. he only sleeps at night while swaddled. during the daytime it's a serious struggle to get him to sleep. he gets so overtired it's ridiculous and i'm worried that he's not getting enough. however, whenever i track his sleep, he gets about 13-15 hours a day. he just takes a ton of cat naps. how can i get him on a schedule? i'd love for him to take a longer morning nap and afternoon nap. is it too early for a schedule?	alwaystryharder	/r/Mommit/comments/3t67w2/when_to_put_a_7_week_old_on_a_schedule_and_how/	16	2	0	0.63	1447777409.0

what i tell myself to be ok with being a working mom	i've been seeing a lot of posts lately from moms coming off maternity leave and having a really hard time going back to work and leaving their lo in day care. i thought i'd add my reflections on how i talk to myself about it. maybe it will be helpful, maybe not, and maybe it will just open up the options for others to share. some background on my situation i'm 36, have a 6 month old, work full time in a job i enjoy but is one of those where you bill 40 hours, but work 50+ hours a week. our son is in an in-home family day care, and up until last week he was ebf. i would love to be able to stay home with my son. i hate the idea of missing out on milestones and i hate pumping at work. but that's not really an option. when i start getting wound up, i consider two major points that i'm doing this for him, and that he is thriving in day care. there are certain priorities i have for my son, including being able to provide him the best education i can as he gets older. it's also important to me that we be able to travel across the country so he can be fawned over by his aunts and uncles and cousins and grandma. i want to give him a nice house with an outdoor yard where he and his dad can play catch. in middle-class america, those things all mean money, and in our family, it means double income. i returned when he was at 3 months, and because of my demonstrated commitment to my career, i'm eligible for a promotion that would include relocation and a raise. the relocation would be to a part of the country with a 30% lower cost of living than where i currently am, and i would be working out of my home. even though he'd still go to day care so i could work, i'll still be spending more time with him and i'll be better able financially to give him the things that i believe are important. the second part is much bigger, and i honestly think that if he wasn't thriving in daycare i would have a much harder time. almost immediately after he started daycare he became much more vocal and started babbling away telling us all about his day. his engagement and fascination with other kids is through the roof. he comes home happy and happily reaches out to the provider when he sees her . the provider has been doing home daycare for 30 years. i've taken care of a child for 6 months. i never babysat, i'm the youngest in my family, and never took care of younger cousins. the truth that i remind myself of and accept is that while i may be hc's mommy, and know him, the provider is better at child care than i am. she knows better than i what the triggers are for healthy v. sick baby; has helped me learn how to read his sounds and actions. she's much more skilled at knowing what kind of play is best for his development level. i kind of hate that my caretaker is better at taking care of my son than i am, and i'm sure that if i was home i'd learn all the little things that she knows through practice. also, my lack of experience with babies means i'm not surprised by this. tbh, i didn't even get babies until i had my son. but i know that i'm providing a better life for him, and that he is in the best hands while i'm away. is it ideal? of course not. but is it ok? absolutely. my son is happy, he's developmentally excelling, and he's constantly sick from daycare germs . and his success is what is most important to me.	kiki_The_blonde	/r/Mommit/comments/3u5bh2/what_i_tell_myself_to_be_ok_with_being_a_working/	16	80	0	0.93	1448409190.0

question about my 15 month old daughters behavior when upset	my 15 month old recently has been displaying weird behavior when she gets upset or if she falls down and gets startled or maybe a bit sore. normally if she gets upset and its obvious that she's not crying for attention but is actually upset i will obviously hug or cuddle and comfort her. recently though, she will be okay with the snuggle for a few moments but then she starts crawling away. generally, she will crawl a few feet, turn around and look at me crying with an expression that she is clearly upset, and then crawl a little further, repeat turn around, etc. is this normal? is this just her being independent? or is it possible that she is acting out because she is weaning from exclusively being breast fed, and only wants nursing comfort? i dont know / it seems obvious that she is wanting comfort, but at the same time pushing away from me. perhaps i coddled her too much in the past? i don't know, i don't think i was overdoing comforting her whenever she actually gets hurt or upset. please help if you have experienced this before.

mamas who had a natural /med-free birth... tell me your happy stories!	hello! i'm a mother of one, an 18-month old, and i'm currently expecting my second, due in april. i really like the idea of giving birth without drugs, maybe a waterbirth... on a mental level. emotionally, i'm terrified. here's the thing; i tried it the first time around. i had a midwife, and was at a great hospital that has nice big birthing pools, etc. i'd done lots of reading, had my soothing music and massagers... i thought i was prepared. unfortunately, i stalled- for hours- at ~9cm, and my son was at an awkward angle and we could not get him to budge. eventually the contractions were practically nonstop and it seemed as though nothing existed but pain. when it seemed we could do nothing else, i was given pitocin and an epidural and my son was born with forceps. all in all, it was a 48 hour labor, 3 of which were pushing. i'm not upset about the way things went. he was fine, i was fine , and of course as soon as i saw him, it was all worth it. but now that i know first-hand how rough labor can be, i'm significantly more scared this time around than i was last time. i know that odds are it will be quicker this time, and that i may well not have the same complications. i know that i can opt for the epidural if i so choose. but- on a mental level, at least- i'd really love to give the more natural approach another go. this will be my only other time giving birth , and i'd love that experience. so if you had natural /med-free childbirth, and it was a positive experience, please tell me about it! i'd love to shake some of this fear. tl;dr i had a rocky labor with my first, and am now more scared about childbirth with my second. i'd love to hear some positive childbirth stories, particularly with natural /med-free labors. thanks so much!

ten month old with major jet lag! any advice on flipping his sleep schedule would be great!	sorry for any spelling/grammar errors, im on my phone and super tired. my son and i just flew back to the east coast of the united states from a month long visit with my family in australia on wednesday and despite attempts over the last few days to flip his sleep schedule my son is staying up all night and wanting to sleep all day. so far trying to keep him awake during the day results in an extremely unhappy baby. he doesn't want to eat more than a little bit of solids, only to nurse for every meal, which of course causes him to fall asleep. he is hitting me, pulling hair, throwing things and not listening and he's very clingy. yesterday i woke him after four hours into what would be his overnight sleep to try and restart his schedule and kept him up until 7 30pm except a short 30 min nap while he nursed, which would be his normal bed time. then he slept from 7 30pm til 9 30pm and has been awake since. its now 6am and i am exhausted! there is not much i can do to keep him quiet over night and my husband works long hours so i hate to have the baby disturbing his sleep. thankfully i am a stay at home mom so its not like i have to stay up all night and then go into an office but i am definitely tired and out of ideas. what can i do? does anyone have advice or experience moving a child's sleep really drastically?

when can babies start talking?	when reading articles on early speech online, everything i can find says that babies can talk as early as 7 months old and no younger. but a friend shared their baby talking on facebook and i've found quite a few videos on youtube of babies 2-5 months old that appear to be talking. do you guys think some babies talk really early or it's all in the parents head? here's some examples of babies saying i love you. 2 month old talking 3 month old talking compilation video 	sassymom7366	/r/Mommit/comments/3vq83x/when_can_babies_start_talking/	4	1	0	0.67	1449449232.0

since you mommies are so awesome with advice d i need help with a bit of a weaning issue, please	tldr partner and i are separating to nap without me; going into child care next week and need to fix this before we give this poor lady a really bad nap time struggle!!! okay even the tldr was a bit long sorry haha hoping to pick a few brains for some ideas on this. her dad wants to end the relationship... but we still have to live together until june/july when our lease is up and he goes to iraq. strangely, we have been civil under the same roof through this hard time.... the 2% is the fact that he has never taken care of her before other than a few times playing with her during bath time and maybe changing some diapers or something rather... etc. i am trying to teach him how to take care of her now that he suddenly wishes to be a bit more involved... which is pretty nice actually. i found a seasonal job to hold over while i look for some stable good work, so this week i have training from roughly 8-12 in the mornings. he took the week off to help out since it's only a few hours and we needed some time to find a daycare or child care. she was exclusively breast fed until 1 year.... now she nurses 2-3 times a day. wake up, after lunch before nap, and at bed time. for me, she doesn't fall asleep at the breast. she bonds and nurses and enjoys it before sleepy times, and then i put her down with a kiss and she goes to bed after watching me walk out of the room. but since this has been her routine for her entire life.... she absolutely is not handling being put to sleep without it. i just don't know how!! we even tried reverting her to a baby bottle today instead of a sippy cup but she just swatted it from his hands and got upset. please, if you have any ideas at all, help me help him. i would really appreciate it. thanks mommies!! edit fixed typos 	ChainsawJane	/r/Mommit/comments/3w68gy/since_you_mommies_are_so_awesome_with_advice_d_i/	2	2	0	1.0	1449719856.0
advice for what to say to mother and sister	since my son was born, we've had a bit of a rough road. colic, poor weight gain, and from 9 months on, monthly fevers . because of this, we haven't sleep trained. unless he's having a fever episode, we start him out in his crib but at some point during the night he starts crying for us and we bring him into our bed so we can all finish out the night with as little sleep interruptions as possible. this is okay with me and my husband. we like him with us, especially during the fevers, but for my mother and sister, this is unacceptable. we should have had him sleep trained long ago and we get regular lectures on how we are setting him, and ourselves, up for failure. i've been polite, i've lied and said we're working on it, but it's always the same. our son is 2, i don't think there's anything wrong with him being with us. has anyone been in a similar situation and have some advice to share?	1kLlamas	/r/Mommit/comments/3wbx9b/advice_for_what_to_say_to_mother_and_sister/	23	14	0	1.0	1449808818.0

sleep...i thought i would know what i was doing this time around! clearly that is laughable.	hi, all. my son is 5 months old. about a month ago, i went back to work...and was more lenient about bringing our son into our bed for part of the night if that helped everyone sleep. then, he got a bad cold, and i was more comfortable with him in our room or even in the bed with me given how congested he was. since then, he has spent some time in his crib, but the last few nights, he just will not stay asleep unless he is next to me or being held in the rocker. i'm rocking him right now because i don't want to put him in our bed again, but its pretty likely that will happen. ideas? i have the no cry sleep solution from when my daughter was a baby, but i do a pretty poor job of putting baby in crib while drowsy/not sleeping. it hurts my back to hunch over the crib patting him or whatever for more than a few minutes. i sometimes sit on the floor with my arm through the rails, but that's not exactly comfortable either. help? advice? or....empathy?	sunburst29	/r/Mommit/comments/3xntdi/sleepi_thought_i_would_know_what_i_was_doing_this/	13	8	0	1.0	1450671187.0

why we're raising our daughter not to believe in santa	before we decided on having a baby, i had always imagined promoting santa. to what extent, i wasn't sure because i wasn't a parent yet. i had grown up with the spirit of christmas all around me and believed in santa a long time. my mom believed in santa right up until her death and always put out milk and cookies for santa every year. with 2 grown kids out of the house, i would tell her, mom this is so silly. we don't believe in santa anymore she would say sweetly, it's not for you, it's for nicky. nicky is our 13 year old white bichon that apparently believes in santa even though he's clearly jewish. i guess i had always envisioned celebrating christmas the same way with my kids. it wasn't until christmas came around last year, with a baby on the way and a 7 year old that i realized we had to rethink our santa strategy. let me start off with a story. in 2013, i went to a christmas party with a predominately caucasian family. i am 5th generation mexican american so while our holiday traditions are not necessarily rooted with mexican traditions, it was very different from how we celebrated christmas. there were 2 little girls aged 2 and 4. one thing we never did was have santa visit our home. it was always at the mall or a community center. towards the end of the party, the girl's parents made the announcement that we were going to have a visitor. the girls got excited and before we knew it we heard a knock at the door. the girls ran to the door and they both smiled as they opened the door. the oldest girl took a step back and i noticed her face drop from a big smile to a confused and scared expression. the younger girl ran to santa and gave him a big hug. when santa went to hug the oldest girl, she pulled away and ran to her mom and started crying. we had no idea what was going on but what was supposed to be a joyous moment turned into a very awkward one. after a few minutes of asking the girl what was wrong, she finally calmed down enough to say, i don't think that's santa. i think it's my uncle. we all jumped at the opportunity to correct her and said that it was santa. she challenged us and said, if it really were santa, than why did he come through the door instead of the chimney? her logic stunned us and no one knew what to say so we just laughed it off and tried to encourage her to go to santa and say hi. once she felt better, she gave santa a hug and said, maybe you are santa but you look a lot like my uncle. after the girls went to bed, we all breathed a sigh of relief that christmas 2013 wasn't ruined because she found out santa isn't real. i didn't make the connection until this year but christmas 2014 had another santa hiccup. my husband has a 7 year old boy from a previous relationship. let me tell you, blended holidays are very difficult and santa doesn't make it any easier. it was my first christmas with his family and our baby's first christmas i had asked him what we should do about santa because i was really excited to do the whole santa thing. he told me that our son was too smart and didn't believe in santa. i blew him off and decided to promote santa anyway and for the sake of his sanity, he was willing to go along with what i wanted. i started talking to our son about santa and he kind of seemed on the fence about santa so i had hopes i could push him back on santa's lap. he was very skeptical but being 6 at the time, was too distracted with his legos to listen to me. we went all out. we had a letter from santa, gifts from santa and of course visited santa. a few days before christmas, i found out about this cool app through google that would call our son and wish him a merry christmas. i was so excited. my husband humored me of course and helped me plan out the call. the night before christmas, we sat our son down, read him 'twas the night before christmas and settled him in for his call. when the call came, he listened intently at first but after the call he got angry and said, that wasn't santa! he's not real! why are you lying to me? where did that call come from? i sat there stunned and my husband looked at me as if to say, sorry but the jig is up. he hugged our son and said, you're right. it was just an app that was supposed to be fun. santa is just for fun and it's more about him representing the spirit of christmas. after our son went to bed, my husband hugged me and i apologized. of course these are just anecdotal stories to explain why we made this decision. it was such a disaster both times. each child had a look of confusion on their faces. horrified at the idea of santa not being real or horrified at the idea that we kept lying to them. our main question was what do we do about our daughter? with a 7 year old that doesn't believe in santa and a baby that has no idea what's going on, what balance could we bring to the idea of santa? being someone who truly wants to celebrate christmas in the most enriching way possible, which to me means really promoting and having fun with santa, i had to take a step back and thing about what was best for both our kids. so, as i always do when i need time to contemplate the universe, i jumped in the shower. both our kids are highly intelligent. they are surrounded by people that are educated and very thoughtful in their teachings. it makes total sense that our son is logical enough to figure things out and i suspect that our daughter will follow suit. what we teach in our home is tolerance, looking at the reality of a situation, being aware of the truth, being giving and kind to others, accepting people for who they are, having hope; among many, many other teachings through our own experiences. how can we successfully instill these crucial principles to the idea of santa. once i realized what the question was, it was easy to find the answer let our children decide if they want to believe in santa or not. give them the facts. educate them about the meaning and spirit of christmas and let them decide what their beliefs will be. of course this lesson wouldn't be complete without making sure we explain to them that if they decide not to believe in santa, they needs to be tolerant of other people's beliefs and not ruin the fun for them. my goal is to avoid any additional conflict between our children. the conflict of one sibling believing in santa and the older sibling constantly telling the younger sibling that santa isn't real. we already have the cards stacked against us with a blended family and one sibling being away with their other parent every other weekend, while the other sibling gets to stay with us. once a child find outs santa isn't real, they are plagued with confusion, fear, and anger that we lied to them for so long. while learning how to manage these emotions is a lesson in itself, if i can prevent my kids from experiencing this, i will. i firmly believe that this is where the parent/child relationship starts to deteriorate. now, i'm not a scientist, although i wish i were so i could study and measure this, and while i have looked for studies on this, there are no studies to measure the link between a child finding out santa doesn't exist and the deterioration of the parent/child relationship. to me, it makes perfect sense. up until now, your child has had 100% trust in you. they come to you for love, comfort, nourishment and enrichment. up until this point, there has been no reason for them to mistrust you. why give them that opportunity to mistrust you? once they find out you lied to them, they are confused about what else you're lying about. why you lied to them. or even if they could trust you again. they start to have self doubt when you tell them things. especially when it comes to your love for them or how you perceive them. we all know how intuitive kids are and it's because they haven't gained those insecurities that make them second guess themselves. their thoughts are so pure and blunt and that's why they can see and speak the truth. if the first 5 years are so crucial, this isn't the time to make your kids distrust you. from there, they start to act out by questioning you and your motives. they become more and more distant because that bond has started to break apart. they don't have the skills an adult has to communicate that they were hurt by your actions. which means there is no opportunity to repair things through communication and as they grow up, things start to pile up. this all sounds very dramatic, i get that but what i learned is to be a long term thinker. it took me a few years to finally understand this concept but i realized that what i do now, even little things, has the potential to impact my child's well being, outlook on life and self esteem. i will never be a perfect parent and i don't try to be but i am educated enough to realize that i should be doing and saying things in the most positive manner possible. then there's the notion of using santa as a method to keep your kids in line throughout the year. let me tell you, if i have to use santa as a scare tactic to keep my kids disciplined, i have bigger issues to worry about. santa should be fun. he should be seen as the spirit of christmas. not someone who decides if a child has been good all year or not. i want to avoid my children thinking that santa has the ability to punish them or reward them. that's my job. my job is to educate my children and help them understand when they have done something to hurt someone else, themselves or have doing something unsafe. and don't get my started on big brother the elf on the shelf. the minute i told my husband these shower revelations, he said, finally you see it my way. i guess you just have to let people realize things for themselves which is why i think the greatest gift i could give my children this year, and every year, is the ability to chose for themselves what they want to believe. once they do decide, i will support their decision 100%. if they want to put cookies out for santa, i'll bake the best cookies if they want to write a letter to santa, i will personally, hand deliver the letter to santa at the northpole myself this not only gives them the independence they need but also helps me, little by little, to become tolerant of the decisions they will make throughout their life. but please god, no tattoos!		/r/Mommit/comments/3yus8k/why_were_raising_our_daughter_not_to_believe_in/	9	1	0	0.52	1451524014.0
stuffed animals. how many is too many?	as a child i had tons of stuffed animals and one favorite. then at about ten i was allergy tested and turns out i'm allergic to dust mites and the first thing to go was all my stuff animals except for the one favorite. i was devastated. now my son is one and he has a few bears around his room and one monkey that hangs out in his crib. he really hasn't formed any attachment to anything yet. my main concern is him getting more. i don't want him to have a ton. my husband had a ton growing up as well but he also has the same allergy and i'm just certain baby boy will have it too and i don't want to do that to him. i'm very picky about his room being clutter and dust catching things free. am i being over paranoid? do kids need a ton of stuffed animals? my grandma sent me a bunch before kiddo was born and i nearly had a panic attack, they are tucked away for now... uhhhh just thinking of it makes me uneasy.

what are the best living options for a family with two kids?	idk where to ask this. also, we are so so far from being able to afford a single family home . so, all that being said, what are the best compact/community living options for a family with 2 small kids? right now we rent a condo on the second floor. the space is fine, but the downstairs neighbors hate us . i can't stand the neighbors next to us because their kid does run wild and all of them stomp all over the floor which i can hear and feel in my unit. i'm nervous to move because right now we can't hear anything from our upstairs neighbor . and though my downstairs neighbor throws loud, nighttime parties twice a year and blasts their music for 45 minutes a day, it's tolerable. i'm worried if i move to another apartment it'll be 100 times worse with the music and the noise from above. but, i can't keep having my kids walk on eggshells . i don't want to be stressed because any slight noise or thump will trigger the downstairs neighbors, but their loud music and nighttime parties stress me out. it's just a stressful situation. anyway, in your experience, aside from the obvious single family home choice, what's the next best choice for a family with two small kids?		/r/Mommit/comments/3z9tiq/what_are_the_best_living_options_for_a_family/	7	3	0	1.0	1451828205.0

at what point should i be concerned about having a violent child?	this does seem a little premature because my daughter is only 8 months, but she is starting to really hurt me. she's a big biter, and recreationally will just reach out and chomp on whatever flesh she can get , and has left blood blisters and sores in multiple places. she seems amused by this. she hits, pinches, and scratches with great delight. each time this happens, i put her down and say oww, that hurt mommy , or in the case of bites yelp loudly and do the same. she cries, usually because she was startled by my yelps i think, but it doesn't seem to phase her at all. at what point should i change my tactic? as far as i know she only does this to me and not to others, but i'm dreading the day that i get a call from daycare that she hit or bit another kid.		/r/Mommit/comments/3zfzgy/at_what_point_should_i_be_concerned_about_having/	12	6	0	0.87	1451932454.0
need advice on changing the way my 2 year old naps.	so at around 6 months old we successfully ferberized him for nighttime sleep, but for naps it would never work. he would just stand in his crib and stubbornly cry, no matter how tired he was. i finally gave in and ever since, he has needed me or daddy to lay with him in our bed and kind of hold him until he falls asleep. now he's about to be two, and i'm looking into preschool/daycare, but i need to somehow get him used to napping by himself. three times i tried putting him in his crib at nap time, after rocking, reading, and soothing, but he just cried hysterically until i came back in there . i mean today he cried an hour, even though he was obviously exhausted! i don't know what to do, but i know i need to transition him because day care workers definitely aren't going to hold him to sleep . if anyone has experienced a similar situation, your advice will be greatly welcomed! i would call this child a clingy or velcro child, so i don't know if that makes a difference to anyone. thanks!!	nilbogresident	/r/Mommit/comments/3zgcqm/need_advice_on_changing_the_way_my_2_year_old_naps/	4	3	0	1.0	1451937375.0
 seeing a pregnant women is instantaneously repulsive to me; more so when the she beast is bikini clad 	this was a comment left on my blog today disgusting. i will never understand why you people insist we think and feel the way you do. seeing a pregnant woman is instantaneously repulsive to me; more so when the shebeast is bikini clad. i bet your own wife looks great pregnant with your child. the rest of us would just like some damned decorum and respect. it was in response to a post i'd written 17 months ago about my wife going swimming in her bikini whilst 39 weeks pregnant. you can see the original post here but really i'm wondering what you think? do you agree with this guy who commented, or with me and think that there is nothing wrong with baring all when you're pregnant?

he doesn't want another baby	my husband will be 40 this month, and his dad recently passed. i think this is what has caused him to start thinking about his mortality, death, etc. when we married he was mid 30s and we had agreed on 2-3 kids and waiting 2 years to start having kids. it was closer to 3 years, we now have a 10 month old. we had said we would try for baby 2 right after a year. i noticed he has been in a mood lately, and yesterday i agreed that if he told me, i would just listen and not respond . so he told me he doesn't want another child because he doesn't want to be an old dad, because he doesn't want to be in poor health when the kid is in their 30s, because he would never meet his grandkids- just like his dad never met our son. i listened and asked if we could have a discussion on this next year. because i'm also not ready for baby 2 right now - i've gotta lose the baby weight or i'll have an at-risk pregnancy. plus, i had promised just to listen and not discuss. but you guys- i'm heartbroken. we had even agreed that if baby 2 was a boy we would try a 3rd time for a girl. now, the thought of having an only child makes me so sad! i realize we are blessed to even have this little guy, so please don't think i'm ungrateful. it is just such a change in what i had always envisioned as my family. any thoughts/comments/suggestions? could this just be a mid life crisis thing where his fears of not being around for his kids, change later on? he is in excellent shape & health.		/r/Mommit/comments/40bc2c/he_doesnt_want_another_baby/	69	36	0	0.91	1452433457.0

my almost 3 year old won't go into the ballet classroom how long will this last	my daughter started ballet last week and so far we've had 3 classes. the first time she tried really hard, followed instructions, and did a great job. i was so proud of her. second class she refused to listen to the teacher and sat in the back watching with an angry look on her face. third class she threw a tantrum and dug her feet into the ground and refused to enter the classroom. she cried hysterically. when she calmed down we went in together and sat in the back of the classroom and watched but she still refused to participate . the teacher says this is normal. how long is this going to last? anyone have any tips? we talk about ballet almost every day and i sometimes hold impromptu ballet classes at home. she seems excited and says she will do it next time but that just hasn't happened. edit thank you so much everyone for the feedback. i tried to leave her at the last class. we prepped and talked about it and she agreed that it was ok, but when the time came it was more hysterical crying and i had to drag her into the classroom, then she hung on to me for dear life. so dramatic. the teacher says this is normal and for about 50% of her students it takes them a month to stop crying. so we will forge ahead and keep going. my daughter seems to love doing ballet at home but just not in the classroom.	1emcee	/r/Mommit/comments/40hldq/my_almost_3_year_old_wont_go_into_the_ballet/	15	23	0	0.93	1452530964.0

4 month old longest stretch of sleep is in the late morning -- how to move this to the middle of the night	my 4 month old is killing me quickly - she goes to bed about 7 30, i then feed her at 10 00 when i go to bed, but she is up every half hour-hour the rest of the night, nursing every hour to hour an a half. the longest stretch of sleep i got last night was 45 minutes - i can't handle this and 10 hour work days for too much longer. however, after i feed her in the morning before i go to work she will usually go back to sleep for a longer stretch of time. sometimes this 3 hours, sometimes 5. this morning she ate at 5 15 and then slept until 9. is there a way to move that nice 3-5 hour stretch of sleep from morning to the middle of the night? should i try to put her to bed earlier? later? will this pass? will anything i do help? thanks!

my 16 m/o discovered her eyelashes. how do i get her to stop? lol	hello mommies, my daughter discovered her eyelashes this morning. now she thinks it's fun to tug on them and separate her eyelid from her eyeball. i'm worried if i try to stop her from doing it she will just want to do it more. but i'm also worried she's going to injure her eye if she accidentally scratches it or pokes it with her little fingers. or maybe even get something in her eye if there happens to be something on her hand. does anyone have any advice on this? should i just wait until she's bored of this and moves on? i really don't want her to poke her eye.

what do you do with your baby or toddler all day?	mom of 13mo here. i've been worried i don't do enough educational stuff with my daughter every day. i get the impression from the media that moms are reading to or helping their toddler play with educational type toys most of the day. mine has had a tough time teething and so i don't get much sleep. i'm exhausted literally all the time. my husband is away 4 nights a week. i take care of her nutritional needs, keep the house clean, take her for a walk every day and read to her every night before bed for around 20 mins til she gets sleepy. i have the house set up so that she can always see me in the kitchen or wherever. but she normally entertains herself with toys or household items or just roaming around inside near me. we do have one on one playtime every day but it's probably only an hour total. am i doing enough? please let me know what you do and if you can suggest more that i should be doing.		/r/Mommit/comments/41li8q/what_do_you_do_with_your_baby_or_toddler_all_day/	11	9	0	1.0	1453157227.0
can i please get some input on how to organize these clothes ?!	i am a ftm and i'm almost to the 33 week mark. we're having a bouncing baby boy before we know it and i still have no idea how to organize all of these damn clothes ! we have wonderful friends who sent us home with a gigantic box of hand me downs a few months back. i was so happy i was in tears ! after christmas and meeting up with other friends here and there, we've been steadily adding to our little stock pile. we have at least three loads of just baby clothes of all different sizes ready to go through the wash. we have a small dresser with five drawers waiting to be filled and i can't decide for the life of me how to do it. there's no way all of the clothes we have will fit, and within the next month or so we're going to have two baby showers. both of our moms decided to throw parties which means, you guessed it, more clothes ! i get i'm a first time mom but i honestly overwhelmed with how much we have already and its just going to add up. how do you moms suggest i go about this ? i was thinking going through what we have and keeping what i like the best, and donating what i'm not too fond of. then from there, doing the small drawer for socks and other small stuff and two drawers maybe 0 to 3 months and the bottom two 3 to 6 ? tote the rest and stick it in the backroom and swap out sizes as i need them ? that's honestly as far as i've gotten but i'm not sure if there's a better way to go about it. please help me before i lose my mind. thanks a mil in advance !	leeeeeeenie	/r/Mommit/comments/41mv0h/can_i_please_get_some_input_on_how_to_organize/	6	3	0	1.0	1453176608.0
what do you ladies do about unauthorized facebook posts and your kids?	tl;dr random woman shared a picture of my 6 day old baby on her wall. how can i make my pics even more private without having to stop posting? today i posted an adorable picture of one of my twin girls on facebook . my facebook is completely private unless i have authorized you to see my page. with that being said, there is a woman that i am friends with that i have pretty much lost touch with. she was a coworker of mine 5 years ago, and since i left that job we have not talked once, except from an occasional facebook comment. since having the twins she has commented on a bunch of the pictures, which is totally fine and innocent. but an hour ago she did something that made me uncomfortable--she shared that picture that i posted to her facebook. what the hell? i don't get why someone would share a personal picture of a baby that belongs to pretty much a stranger at this point. i don't like it, and i was going to report it as unauthorized use of property but i was curious if this was the right route to take. tomorrow i am going to make a private group to post pictures to vs my personal facebook page. have any of you done this? i personally love fb because i have so many close friends and family out of town and this is a way we connect, so i don't want to stop posting picture. but seriously...who shares a random picture of someone else's kid?! ugh. if not a group, have you guys done anything else with fb to make it as private as possible?

looking for parents with kids age 3-10 y.o. who still believe in santa.	hi all, my name is mike and i need your help! i am currently developing a behavioral tool helping parents promote good behavior throughout the year with a series of monthly check-in letters from santa. as a parent you will have the flexibility to provide us with either a custom message or pick from one of our suggested messages in advance of each monthly mailing, giving you the ability to praise a child for good behavior or motivate improvement in the future. a monthly check in from santa is a good way to remind children to uphold their end of the bargain and takes the onus off you to nag your children to behave. we are launching a trial version of our product and looking for 20-30 parents to participate for free and provide some feedback along the way. to sign up or learn more, please visit our website 12lettersfromstana. thank you!!! mike	Grilling	/r/Mommit/comments/427h6w/looking_for_parents_with_kids_age_310_yo_who/	6	6	0	0.8	1453495460.0
i'm 23 and want to have kids young... how long should i wait based off your experience?	some background on my current scenario i'm 23, with a good job, annually about $50k, about $17k in student debt, with a boyfriend of about 3 years. now, i always hear that you should wait and i'm definitely open to that especially if that will be best for future kids and myself. i know it's no cake walk. my few factors for wanting to start young is i want to be a mom, i want kids while i'm fit and healthy and can run around with them, i want to have a big family , and i want to be a decently young grandparent. i've always been told there is no great time to have a kid. i want to travel, but every time i do, i feel like it's detracting away from what i actually want. i'd ask my mom what she thinks, but she died when i was 6 and she was 33. i was the youngest of 4. so mommies of reddit, when did you have your kids and how did it turn out? i'll answer any questions you may have if that i'll help give you advice. edit wow, love the stories - keep them coming! all great things i want to hear and everyone so far has at least one nugget of wisdom.	theothergirlonreddit	/r/Mommit/comments/42bari/im_23_and_want_to_have_kids_young_how_long_should/	95	32	0	0.89	1453563834.0

how to break into that clicky group of moms?	i had my oldest at 16. she is now 8, and i'm 25. love our age difference, not sure if it matters in this story but i think it's relevant. i got married 3 years ago to a wonderful man and this past fall we moved from a small apartment an hour from a big city to a big city right smack in the middle of a rich neighborhood. my daughter started elementary here and loves it. she's making friends left and right and i'm trying to find her friends mom's on facebook. the few i have found, have not accepted my friend request after me messaging and saying who i am. my daughter was an only child , and has no cousins her age. she's quite lonely. so i try to put her in theater programs, dance class... that stuff. we go to family night at school, movie night, class parties... the moms there are very snobbish. i am quite an introvert but i make an effort to be friendly and get out of my bubble at events like that since i'm hoping these moms will allow their kids to come to my daughters birthday. at the movie night, they all saved each other seats and spent the entire movie talking. my daughter is good friends with their kids and the kids begged to sit together so i just sat on my blanket next to this group of moms and felt like an idiot. i mentioned my age earlier, these women are all.. women, who dress in business casual.. whereas i feel like a kid around them, not sure if that makes since. i wear jeans and a tshirt, long hair down with no jewelry. i guess i'm saying it looks like a divide maybe. any other day, in any other situation, i'd say screw them, but for my daughter's sake i need to try and infiltrate this secret mom club. i couldn't bare to see her face at a birthday where no friends show up. 	jennyy1	/r/Mommit/comments/42qxdt/how_to_break_into_that_clicky_group_of_moms/	15	24	0	0.88	1453803822.0

thumb sucking-how to make it stop during naps and bedtime?	p is 2.5yo and had her first dentist appointment last october. her teeth are in great shape, except a little bucking from thumb sucking. her dentist told me we should try really hard to get her to stop because she could need braces as a result-which i know can be ridiculously expensive. anyways, since then we've tried cayenne , this stuff called thum and the only thing that seems to work is just asking her so when shes extremely tired and napping or in bed for the night she sucks her thumb. what could i do to help her stop that? should we just keep up with the asking her to stop and hope she gives up during sleep?

need some advice. complicated and long	i am a single mom of 1. i'm 24 years old. my son's father is 30 and has 8 kids total with 7 baby moms. i know i know huge mistake on my part, i've already accepted that its whatever. i love my son more than anything and wouldn't trade him no matter how bad things get with his dad. anyway! i've been single since i was about 6 months pregnant. his dad has come and gone in and out of my life and in and out of our son's. seeing him when it worked with his schedule, taking him when it worked for him, being very selfish through his entire 1.5 years of life. we finally stopped trying to make things work back in august when my son's father ran off and got married in florida to a girl who was 10 weeks pregnant by him. up until that point, and i feel stupid for saying this, we were still sleeping together even though we were so on and off depending on when he wanted to feed me lies of how he missed us, how he wanted to make our family work, how he needed us. blah blah. anyway when he got married, i was done. i was done with him coming over to see our son, i was done communicating with him since all he did was lie and try to manipulate me. we had been going to church together so that he could see our son at least once a week consistently before all of this. after this i stopped going but continued to send my son with a mutual friend through church. the agreement was that his dad would give this friend $30 a week to pay for daycare and that i would still send him to church and that would be the only time he would see him. there were multiple issues with him lying to me about where he was when he had our son on his days when we were doing that, about who he was with, and what he was giving him so there was going to be no unsupervised visits after he ran off and got married to a girl noone knew existed except his family. moving on. this arrangement of going to church lasted two weeks, then his father stopped going, no text no calls to let me know, just stopped going, so i didn't get any money and he wasn't seeing him. at this point i was done. i had tried to make things work on some level and every chance he got to bail he did. i sent my son two more weeks just to cover my butt, then stopped sending him since our friend was becoming solely responsible for my childs well being when at church since his father wasn't there. i had not seen my son's father in almost 6 months, nor had i responded to calls, text or emails that were about once every three weeks, and then of course christmas eve and christmas day asking to see our son. i went radio silent. i needed my space, and my son didn't need someone disrupting his schedule every couple of weeks when the mood hit his father to play daddy. now the interesting part. last night i get home, get my son to sleep. he was very cranky and tired. i put him to sleep a little early. i was getting ready to start dishes when i heard a knock on my kitchen door. i assumed it was my neighbor across the street since her daughter loves my son and we had just gotten home. i opened the door, the visitor turned around since he was facing the other direction and as soon as i realized who it was my body froze. it took a fraction of a second, my son's father started to say something and i slammed the door and locked it. i stood for a second thinking, we have a cse case set for the 17th of this month. i could either say what i wanted to him now, or i would have to wait to see him then. i have been having some anxiety about seeing him at this cse since i haven't seen him since august. i didn't know what would go through my head or how i would feel. i decided i needed to see him now, since he was here and i was already having anxiety and just get that first time seeing him over with that way i had time to process anything i felt or whatever. so i unlocked the door and went outside, he was pulling out of the driveway but he stopped. i told him he had some nerve showing up uninvited, unannounced and that he was a pos and we have been doing fine without him and our son is so smart and so precious and so sweet and i'm not the one missing out he is, i basically lit into him. the whole time he is standing there telling me how he has changed, he isn't doing drugs, he isn't out running around, hes moved out of his mom's basement, he wants to be in his son's life, he has grown up. blah blah blah. i'm not falling for it i have heard everything he said last night at least two other times from him. but i heard him out. i wanted to see if there was an angle he was trying to work and what not. after standing outside for half an hour, he asked if he could see our son. i told him that he was sleeping, he asked if he could at least walk in and see him, he promised not to wake him up. now i've screamed and yelled and belittled him for the past half hour, he did drive over to try to talk to me, i gave in a little and said fine, u can walk in and see him. then we'll talk for a minute and u need to leave. fine. he went in, saw him, he didn't wake him up came back out and sat down in the kitchen. he told me he knows about the cse i will be getting money through that, when he gets his taxes in that he has already filed he will give me some of that. he asked me not to seek back child support at the cse since it'll take him awhile to get caught up, but he is gonna make sure i get my cs when they establish it. blah blah blah. he asked then if he could come over and see him regularly. i told him i wouldn't make any promises last night, because i needed to absorb everything that was happening and what he was saying to me. he said if he has to he'll come over every night to just see him sleeping but he really wanted to spend time with him awake that way our son knows who he is. i told him again, i wasn't going to make any decisions yet. one night of driving to my house uninvited didn't make me believe he was a good role model. here's my question what do i do? he wants us to go to orangeleaf tonight so he can see our son if we decide not to go then he has already said he will stop by every night to see him while sleeping until i agree to more. i don't want to lose the healing i have done for myself and i don't want to ruin the progress or routine of my son. he listens to me, we have our bond, we know each other, he has always and could always count on me. so what do i do moms. u can see this clearer than i can. not sure if i can post this is r/singleparent since they may consider this ex-bashing sorry for spelling, and that the post jumps around a little. i'm just trying to get it all out quickly. edit tl dr my son's father has been in and out of his since birth, he has never been supportive or helpful. we broke up due to lies and manipulation. he eloped with a girl who was pregnant by him then stopped seeing our son as we agreed. haven't seen or spoken to him in months, he showed up at my door last night begging to be let back into our sons life. wants us to go get icecream with him tonight so he can see our son for the first time in 4 months. we go for child support on the 17th.

sahms, how does your household make it work?	my lo is currently a little over two and a half and we are planning more in the near future. while this is going on, i've slowly realized that i still despise dropping lo off with someone else every morning, going to a job i hate, then going just to have him call me miss . i hate it. yesterday i left my job due to policies that directly discriminate against those that have children. if the office got a call for you, you were forced to leave, lost pay for the rest of the day, and earned a point that got you halfway to being fired. my son is two. boo-boos and fevers are going to happen. they crossed the line when they demanded access to my medical records when i was out for two days for suspected appendicitis. it wasn't; however, they still don't want me working yet because they haven't figured out what it actually is . point is, i'm out of work and i never want to go back. after looking over the numbers, it looks like there was only about $100-150 of my weekly takehome that wasn't going directly to daycare. we were making it well enough, but certainly not by enough to have $400-$650/monthly just disappear. so, i guess my question is this.... those of you that are sahp, is there anything you do on the side between cleaning up the house and managing your own lo that i should be looking into before we take the plunge into deciding that i should stay at home? we've looked at all of the emotional, developmental , and financial impacts, as well as what the new division of responsibilities around the house would look like and it would be perfect for us, if we could simply fill in that $400-650/month gap. i would just like to note that i do have a spotless background check. absolutely the only thing that the government has me on file for is a speeding ticket 6+ years ago and a name change when we got married; however, there are zero, that's right zero other children in the area, so if your recommendation is babysitting, i am totally open to extra little ones running around during the day, but do not have the slightest idea how to attract their parents, as there are not any local. thank you so much for any recommendations! please note, this will be x-posted to a few other subs i have in mind and i will gladly take recommendations from any of you regarding other subs that may have good resources for this.	mini22	/r/Mommit/comments/44yfvi/sahms_how_does_your_household_make_it_work/	32	29	0	0.87	1455046349.0
to vacation or not to vacation...need advice please	i have a 3 month old baby. her father is a heroin addict who abandoned us emotionally during my pregnancy. he used, lied, cheated, and stole from me. he didn't want to be on the birth announcements, didn't want me to tag him on anything baby-related on facebook so no one would know, and would do things like look at my belly and say, i can't believe i'm bound to you by this. i moved out in august, and had the baby in october. there is a lot more background i don't really have the energy to get into right now. but it was really bad for a long time. he got on suboxone when i was in labor, and i let him come to the birth. but we had a deal that if he didn't stay clean after i caught him in august then he wouldn't be on the birth certificate. he continued to use, so i stuck to it and i am the only parent listed on the birth certificate. there are many reasons, but mainly i wanted to do what i could to keep her safe and not have to leave her alone with him. . now that the baby is here and he's clean, he wants to be a father and thinks i should move back in with him and basically act like nothing happened. he's never had any real consequences from his actions in the past and he doesn't seem to understand why i don't want to move back. even though he's clean we still fight all the time and he is still a dick. anyway, i am currently in the bahamas with my parents and the baby. we are going to be gone for almost 3 weeks. i have a remote job and can work anywhere i have an internet connection which is great. her father was really unhappy about it and at times is mean and nasty when he's not getting his way. he told me yesterday not to take her away for 3 weeks again because it's too hard on him. he then told me i'm breaking the law by not putting him on the birth certificate, but don't worry, we'll fix it when you get back. so here's my dilemma. my parents are going to france for 3 weeks in april, and they just offered to take me with them. if course i want to, but i'm afraid of what he'll do if i go. does anyone have advice? has anyone been in a similar situation? i want to be fair to him, but i don't want to let him control what i do out of fear of the hardships he could cause. tl;dr father of baby is a heroin addict and kind of a jerk, and doesn't want me taking the baby out of town. what do?	isisis	/r/Mommit/comments/459itz/to_vacation_or_not_to_vacationneed_advice_please/	25	37	0	0.95	1455207216.0
i really can't with the shrieking. advice?	i've got a happy, energetic 19 month old son. he's got joie de vivre oozing of of every pore of his tiny toddler body. it's amazing. he's recently developed this habit of shrieking at the top of his lungs all day, for every reason and no reason. at home, in the car, at the grocery store, in restaurants. it's ear piercing, glass shattering, awful. i know that it's developmentally appropriate behavior. i also know that it's socially unacceptable behavior and it's my responsibility to hello him figure out how to control the screaming. i, personally, need to figure out how to make it stop. i use my words in a firm voice , i put my hand over his mouth and use a firm voice . i've tried time outs. i've tried flicking his cheek when i'm near enough and use a firm voice . he is definitely aware that mama doesn't like it, he mostly does it when he's on the other side of the house , he'll make eye contact with me and do it. typical toddler, i know. exacerbating the irritation of the behavior, i'm 11 weeks pregnant and sick as a dog, my patience is so limited and it really sends me over the edge, hormotionally speaking. i know i'm opening pandora's box by putting this on the interwebs. please keep your comments positive and supportive in nature. any advice?	bibliovorusrex	/r/Mommit/comments/45cj8i/i_really_cant_with_the_shrieking_advice/	6	8	0	1.0	1455244101.0
any suggestions for not-necessarily-kid-friendly but safe-for-little-kid movies/shows? from netflix and amazon prime, preferably.	i have a 3 year old boy, for reference. he basically only sleeps when i do, but that's a whole nother story. this is valid because i'm so, so sick of kiddie shows. i don't care if he likes it, he doesn't have to pay attention. there can be sex/alcohol jokes, as long as they're masked - think blanche in the golden girls; that stuff goes right over kids' heads. but something direct, not so much... i'm just lazy, i guess. i'm looking for something that will give me a break from my incredibly inquisitive, sponge-brained child. i don't want to have to field too many questions, or ones that i can easily answer - not why did he ask if he could feel the other boy's sister's boobs? . so. here's the ones i have found - cosmos - the occasional scarier bit in the cartoon sequences about people being hung for heresy or whatever. and i did have to explain that, when neil degrasse tyson talks about the earth dying, he means in billions of years. still awesome. - keeping up appearances british comedy from the eighties or so. most of the jokes result from a social climbing middle class woman trying to be upper class and hiding her lower class relatives. my boy calls it the show about the 'silly grandmom,' and likes it a lot. - the vicar of dibley small country town in england gets a liberal female vicar and the town conservative is displeased with her quirky actions. some alcohol and sex jokes, but subtly put. the boy doesn't like this one as much as the others, but he still pays attention. - singin' in the rain he wanted to turn it off halfway through, but liked the dance numbers. - wizard of oz getting back into kiddie land, but we both enjoyed it. the scariness level is about right - i like slowly increasing the frightening stuff, and this scared but didn't terrify him. - grease the 'sex scene' of rizzo and what's-his-face messing around in the car was the most i've seen so far , and i just distracted him for a moment - he'd probably have thought she was getting hurt or something. - discover planet ocean it's not on netflix anymore, but this was the perfect ocean show for the ocean obsessed kiddo. all about interesting sea critters, but no savagery. they showed a shark 'feeding frenzy' once, but it just showed the sharks going nuts, no bloody results. and i found the info so interesting! unlike that goddamn david attenborough one i saw when he was like, four months old when the orcas kill the baby whale. ugly tears from me on that one, i'd hate to see what it did for him, haha. - mr bean i was shocked, shocked that he didn't go for this one. i played him the episode where he goes to the pool. i think that the fact that mr. bean doesn't do the right thing bothered him . and it shows mr. bean's butt when he's running away after he loses his shorts - i'm fine with non-sexual nudity. i'll post more if i think of them. criteria - not a show made just for kids, very minimal violence, mild nudity is okay , sex jokes should go over his head, not focused on drugs either, i guess . whatcha got, ladies?	paprikashi	/r/Mommit/comments/45n0bn/any_suggestions_for_notnecessarilykidfriendly_but/	9	13	0	0.99	1455401582.0

how soon to start discipline?	 tl;dr daughter is a tyrant. need help. my daughter is 16 months old and i am at the end of my rope with her today. i've never in my life been frustrated by her behavior until this day. i got her two cans of those gerber puffs things and when we got home, she demanded i give them to her and proceeded to dump the contents of both cans all over my coffee table and living room floor. while i was cleaning it up, she managed to get onto my kitchen table and empty the can of puffs i'd already refilled all over the kitchen table and floor. i only realized she was on the table because i heard an alarmed cry from the kitchen and walked in to see her legs dangling off the edge as she struggled to get back up onto the table. she had pushed one of my chairs over to the table and climbed on! so, i took one of my baby gates and i gated it off and she shrieked about it. i actually had to step outside to cool down. after this, i was once again cleaning up the puffs off the floor and i come from the kitchen into the living room and she has her juice upside-down dumping it all over the coffee table!!! i actually said her name in an angry voice and glared at her, which i never do. she doesn't normally make me mad, you know? aside from today's incident, she takes off her diaper and laughs like it's a game when you tell her to stop. in fact, any time she does something bad and you tell her to stop, she laughs and continues on as if you hadn't said anything. she has given me a black eye from headbutting me. she hits, she bites. she grabs at my laptop which she knows she isn't allowed to touch because in october, she managed to fry the hard drive by pounding the keys. any time you don't do what she wants, when she wants, she cries like you are skinning her alive. she insists on being carried everywhere . the other night i was trying to cook and she was pulling my pants down while having a tantrum because she wanted me to hold her and i was at the stove. it was too dangerous to hold her right then! i can't hardly get her to eat any real food, either. i have tried slapping her hand which works but doesn't work for long. what else can i do? she is only 16 months old. i don't know what kind of discipline you can even give a baby her age. any help is welcome. edit i don't have time to individually reply to each comment but thank you all so much for your advice and i am going to do the things you have suggested! lots of love, guys! <3 	MyDamnCoffee	/r/Mommit/comments/463rav/how_soon_to_start_discipline/	17	33	0	0.95	1455646609.0
when did you potty train?	my son is 18 months old. he's giving all kinds of signs that he's ready to be potty trained. he says change when he needs his diaper changed, and he will even bring me a diaper, wipes and cream. he says potty and knows where the bathroom is. we have his little potty in our downstairs bathroom and he will sit on it with his clothes on and say poop. if i say i have to go pee , he runs to the bathroom with me. i know all kids are different. but i really think he might be ready. and it would be awesome if he was out of diapers before his baby brother arrives in june! i've been reading about ways to potty train..but i'm wondering what worked for you moms here. and at what age did you try? any input will help!	kitkatkelly_	/r/Mommit/comments/468jnd/when_did_you_potty_train/	15	12	0	0.94	1455715689.0
seeking advice on helpful gifts for new parents!	hello! sorry if there are any mistakes or sounds rambly, i'm on mobile and a ton of coffee. my cousin, who is more like a little brother, is now a dad to a healthy baby boy as of yesterday! i was wondering if any of you lovely ladies can help me out with getting them an appropriate care package. i currently live a few hours away from them and am planning to visit in about a month. i know new parents want to have their time alone and they don't want visitors for a few weeks but i'm going to wait at least a month so they don't get bombarded with people right away. my family is huge and can be overwhelming. anywho, i wanted to bring a care package of sorts when i visit. i was looking to get them something that is helpful and is often overlooked. what are some things that you found to be super helpful but didn't expect or didn't get at your baby shower? i was considering getting them a subscription to household things on my amazon account. such as a years supply of toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc. i figured i could have it shipped to their house so it's one less thing they need to worry about. i don't have children myself so i have absolutely no idea what babies need. if there is something that would be more useful, i am all ears. also! he has an 11 year old step daughter and he is pretty much her father. i wanted to get her something as well, so any suggestions there, too. she's a great girl and she's so happy for her new brother. thank you for any and all help!

do you feel guilty if you're bored silly by whatever game your kids want to play?	i suck at playing with my kid. honestly, it's boring for me most of the time. any other moms feel the same way? i just can't get excited about racing cars or whatever it is, but i feel like i should take an interest and attempt to play the kiddo when invited. how do you deal with this? do you get bored? how do you deal with the boredom? i had an epiphany the other day and realized my husband is a genius. maybe i should follow his lead. he basically says, okay, kid, here are the things i like to do and you can do them with me if you want. i like to play basketball, so you can come shoot with me. i like watching star wars, so you're welcome to watch it with me. i wish i could do that as a mom!! but instead i let my kid dictate what he likes to do, and i just sort of follow along. and i sort of lose sight of what i like to do, because i'm busy being a captive audience for him!! ahhh!! anyone else have this issue or is it just me??	forthemilkshake	/r/Mommit/comments/46abih/do_you_feel_guilty_if_youre_bored_silly_by/	5	9	0	1.0	1455735634.0
pregnant with high blood pressure, rapid pulse, light headedness, extreme dizzy spells, and the doctors don't seem to care. any advice?	i hope this is the right place to post something like this. it's not me, but my wife . i asked if i could reach out for advice on here and she agreed. she's 25 weeks pregnant, and for the past probably 10 weeks she's had these symptoms, but more frequently and more severe since week 20. background info her bp is normally very low, around 90-100 over 50-60. that's just how she's always been. our first check up it was 110ish/70ish. high for her, but not bad. it's crept higher, was about 116/80 at 20 weeks, and her pulse has been between 100-110 the entire pregnancy . a couple times she had a spell where she suddenly got excessively hot, light headed and dizzy to the point she had to sit almost immediately. one time she was at work and there was a code she needed to remember to unlock something, and she said she knew it was wrong but the only numbers she could remember were the ones for our garage code. her doctor wrote it off as pregnancy brain, but my wife insisted this was totally different. we bought a cuff and began to take her bp regularly at home. it's usually in the upper 120s or lower 130s now, but several times as high as 140/90 with a pulse in the 120s. finally at the 25 week check up the doctor listened to us and seemed half way concerned. bp was around 130/85 and pulse in 120s, and with history of heart attacks in her family they have told us to see a cardiologist, but that isn't for two weeks. she had another spell today of extreme dizziness and her bp was around 140. granted her doctor has at least acknowledged her bp and pulse are elevated, she still doesn't seem overly concerned. on the other hand, all the women at her work who have seen her have a spell have evidently freaked out and thankfully taken care of her, and they all agree with us that it is not normal for a pregnancy. sorry for the length and probably poor formatting. i just don't feel right sitting around idly in case something serious is wrong, so i thought i'd reach out to others through here and maybe find someone who has experienced something similar. edit thanks for all the quick and thoughtful responses! can't wait to read through the rest. we have an appointment with the cardiologist per her ob, and will go to l&d asap if we need to. i know every pregnancy is unique, but i appreciate all advice and just hearing similar experiences and stories and how it panned out. i'll post any updates. update i remembered this randomly this morning. i don't know if anyone gets notified or not of an update, i don't think so? still, my wife is great now. had issues. basically what was expected and discussed on here and then some. she was fine once our beautiful child came out, though! albeit a month early!

what is your top reason for shying away from art/craft or a similar form of creativity?	hello all, for the moms here that love art or crafts or want to do more of it i am trying to figure out what are the most important reasons for not doing any art or doing very little? for example for me personally one of the reasons for doing fewer artwork was that i did not have a art table and supplies already set up. what i mean is that every time i wanted to make art i had to set up the table up, get my supplies out. and it took away from any creative energy that i had so i did not do it as much. another example a friend of mine wanted to do art but was stuck because she did not know what to make, what medium to use and what art supplies she needed to buy. so my question is what is your top reason for shying away from art/craft or a similar form of creativity? please be as detailed and specific as possible. if you could take a few moments to answer my question i would be really grateful! i am trying to figure out how i can help individuals that want to be more creative but are unable to do so for different reasons. thanks so much for your time!	peppypri	/r/Mommit/comments/46z436/what_is_your_top_reason_for_shying_away_from/	9	4	0	0.75	1456114336.0

i'm a little skeptical of toddler eating, need some advice.	ok, so this might sound a little confusing, so please let me know if further explaining is needed. this may not be a serious issue and something i can bring up to her doctor, i just thought i'd get fellow mom advice first. my 2.5yo is always hungry, even after she eats. today for instance, shes had a cup of milk, bowl of oatmeal and two scrambled eggs. she just told me shes still hungry, but i dont see how. ive heard and read over and over that your kid won't starve themselves and you should let them eat until theyre full, but i'm a little skeptical of that. for her age she should be getting between 1000-1400 calories a day, which is fine and definitely doable, but i'm kind of wondering if she really is still hungry or if she's saying it just to say it. i dont want to over feed her and become a childhood obesity statistic, but i don't wanna starve her. what are your experiences? and is this just normal toddler behavior?

how to teach toddler to play by himself?	my son is almost 2 and generally will not play by himself for more than a few minutes without starting to whine for me or his dad to come play with him. he's sometimes happy to play by himself if we're sitting right next to him, but if i try to make dinner, he turns into a whining mess. i've tried giving him time limits , but that doesn't work consistently. usually he'll just cry/whine until i'm done with what i need to do and can come read to him or play with him. so the question is, is this just a phase he has to go through, is it just a personality thing, or is there some way i can teach him to be okay with playing while i get things done? because the constant mama come, mama come, mama come, mama come mama come mama come is really starting to grate on my nerves, and i feel bad being so annoyed at him constantly.	awkwardsadfaceturtle	/r/Mommit/comments/498jdh/how_to_teach_toddler_to_play_by_himself/	13	35	0	0.97	1457289612.0

when did your toddler outgrow naps and how did you know?	my 2 almost 3 year old won't nap . it's a huge struggle and sometimes i lay down with her for an hour and she won't nap. i can tell that she's tired. she gets cranky if she doesn't take one but lately it's been so difficult to get her to nap. i think she may be outgrowing it but i'm in denial. as a sahm its my one hour of quiet during the day where i can give my 5 month old full attention or if the baby's napping, have a quiet moment to myself to fold laundry and watch fuller house.	1emcee	/r/Mommit/comments/4a852s/when_did_your_toddler_outgrow_naps_and_how_did/	5	3	0	1.0	1457871246.0
advice for getting baby to nap by herself?	so my little girl is almost 6 months old and we are having trouble getting her to nap alone. she's pretty good about sleeping through the night swaddled in her crib but during the we can't leave her side! usually daddy puts her to sleep in his shoulder and i usually swaddled next to me nursing in bed, she will sometimes sleep for hours that way but if he tries to put her down she wakes and same if i leave the room. all the windows in our apartment are small and we have no curtains so the room really is only so dark. she just seems to sleep lighter. any advice?

help! questions-how to feed a 10 month old?	hi everyone, wondering a few things about feeding my 10 month old. 1. how do you feed 3 meals a day plus bottles when a nap schedule is unpredictable? some days she is up early and may nap 10 30-12, 3 30- 4 30. most days lately she refuses and fights naps until almost 12 and then sleeps until 2 or 3. i don't understand how to fit in my 3 meals with this schedule. 2. what sources of protein should i feed her? an example meal we have is eggs, diced veggies or puree and some multi grain cheerios. her main sources of protein are eggs, plain full fat yogurt, formula and a little bit of peanut butter or cheese here and there. 3. she falls asleep while drinking a bottle in her rocker, then she is moved to her crib while still asleep. im concerned she will have problems because i am not brushing her teeth after the bottle. it often takes hours to get her to sleep at night, so i haven't wanted to risk waking her up. we have been using teeth wipes after meals and a practice silicone massaging baby toothbrush. is that enough? does she need toothpaste?

timing having a baby and going to grad school in the next 2-3 years. tips from people who have done both?	my partner and i are talking about having a baby in the next couple of years, and i've also been considering grad school. i'm looking at two programs, one full-time intensive program that would last for a year, and one part-time program that would take 2-3 years. a couple of ways this could happen 1. do the one year program and then have a kid. on the plus side, i could devote my full attention to the program and then to my young child. but i do worry about how to time getting back to work with that plan. 2. do the 2-3 year program, have baby somewhere in the middle of that , return to work when i graduate. this plan seems like put me a stronger position professionally, but having never raised a baby or attended grad school, i don't know if it's realistic to expect to juggle both. another perk is that this program is mostly nights and weekends, so i could take care of the baby during the day and he could take over at night. what do you think? is either plan realistic? is there anything i'm not taking into account?	minerva_qw	/r/Mommit/comments/4bc104/timing_having_a_baby_and_going_to_grad_school_in/	21	23	0	0.93	1458562813.0

please, know what your kid is capable of	today my son asked to go to the zoo so i drove the hour to take him. he wanted to go on the playground there right away. he runs up the stairs and is playing on the upper level. we were playing for a while when i saw a bigger kid pick him up, i ask him to please put him down then he starts walking around with him, i say do not carry him, at which point i see he's walking toward the edge of the upper level of the playground. i scream noo and run toward the playground he proceeds to drop him from about 10 feet off the ground. i ran over there and after confirming my son wasn't seriously injured yelled what's wrong with you?!? at the child at which point i hear his mother say he doesn't understand he can't do that. if there is any chance your child could do this because they don't understand they can't please keep them away from playgrounds like this, or maybe even playgrounds with other kids at all. this was the most terrifying couple minutes of my life, i thought my son was going to be seriously hurt. thankfully he's okay but he keeps talking about the boy who hurt him off the big cliff and how his body hurts which of course is making me feel awful.

a baby may be in danger but i don't know her mom well and i have no experience with babies. what do?	i have no idea if this is the right subreddit to put this, so if it belongs somewhere else please tell me and i will move it. this just seems like the right place to me. i recently became acquainted with a lady via a mutual friend of ours. she seems very nice and all but literally all i know about her is her name and that she has a special needs baby . for the sake of context, i and the rest of the people mentioned here are between the ages of 19 and 25. none of us besides the lady in question have children and from what i understand she is a single mother. saturday evening i visited this lady and her roommate with my bf and aforementioned mutual friend for an easter party. there was an approximate attendance of twenty people and drinks were provided. at one point everyone went outside to play with the roommate's new puppy and throw a football around. as we were leaving i noticed the baby was strapped into a bumbo sat on the kitchen table. she was completely alone and her mom was nowhere to be seen. no one else was in the house. i pointed this out to my bf and he said it was no big deal and went outside with everyone. i opted to stay inside. i pulled up a chair and waited around with the baby for ~5 minutes thinking maybe her mom would come back for her. she did not. i do not know this woman very well and i have only ever interacted with her baby once before, however i was not comfortable leaving her alone so i did something i would not normally do and picked her up. she seemed ok with me so i carried her around and eventually went looking for her mom. she was outside with the rest of the party throwing eggs at each other in the park across the road. i went out to join them with the baby - keeping in mind it has at this point been half an hour and this baby was completely alone, unfed, and with an obviously soiled diaper. after another ~15 minutes the mom noticed me and came over. she said she was going to feed the baby and took her from me. that was the only exchange we had before they both went back inside. i did not see the baby again, however the mom was around and socializing with friends for the rest of the night. my bf and our mutual friend do not seem to care or find this unusual. my question is do i have any real need to be concerned or am i overreacting? i have no experience with babies and do not want to cause unnecessary drama if i am in the wrong. if this is something that i should worry about, what do i do? i have no evidence that this happened - no pictures, no video, nothing - and i barely know this woman or her family. i do not want to upset anyone or draw attention to myself but i am genuinely concerned for this baby. edit i've taken everyone's advice and am getting in contact with cps. thanks for your input guys!

what are your parent-tricks?	so these may be painfully obvious, i'm not sure. but after two kids i've developed a few little mommy tricks that help me circumvent those annoying parenting moments. these seem to work for my kids. i'd like to share them in case they help anyone out there. - keep a captivating toy by a change table to keep your whirling dervish still during a diaper change. sometimes i keep it in my mouth so he focuses on trying to get it from me instead of spinning around on the change table. that way my hands are free to get that diaper on. - i hate trying to get a cranky baby into his high chair. usually the food is enough to make him sit, but when i'm still not done preparing i put something really attractive to him on the tray . presto! he bends those legs and i strap his a$$ down! - my baby hates his cereal. i pretend to feed him a piece of fruit and sneak a spoonful when his mouth is open, and then give him the fruit. seems sneaky but at least he gets his iron rich cereal and i don't have to worry about anemia! - when my baby learned to roll over and stand in the crib i started gently holding him down after i laid him in the crib. stopping him from rolling over meant he would drift off to sleep instead of holding on to the bars screaming at me. -always keep an arsenal of favorite toys/ books in the car. i keep them in the front seat and when baby or toddler is getting cranky i pass a new toy back to them. when i don't want my baby to fall asleep in his car seat , i give him an empty water bottle. he loves to squeeze and click it. this keeps him awake for the car ride and then he has a proper nap at home. do you have any slight of hand tricks that make your life less painful?

how do you help you children clean their private parts?	backstory is basically my 3 year old has been sick lately and a bit off. she acted like she was afraid to pee. she would not let it out in one stream but sort of hold and go, hold and go. so i was a little concerned maybe she was developing a uti. she hasn't had a bath in a few days because of being sick, so tonight in the tub i had a wash cloth and wanted to help her 'clean herself'. the routine is usually i let her do it, but with my help ...she freaked out, she kept telling me her privates hurt, and not to touch her, in a total panic. this naturally, scared the crap out of me, so i was able to get a glimpse to see what was going on 'downtown' and basically, she needs a good cleaning down there. i think that's really what's bothering her, but she's so sensitive down there she won't even let me clean her. so, moms, what's your technique at keeping your kids private parts clean? long story for a simple question, but it worried me how she was suddenly so protective of herself	Cpianti	/r/Mommit/comments/4grumz/how_do_you_help_you_children_clean_their_private/	14	22	0	0.92	1461808674.0
 advice on potty training!!!	so, my son will be two in about a week and baby 2 will be here in 10 weeks. and we are super excited about it. but...i wanted my son to at least be in the potty training process if not potty trained by the time 2 was here. we have started the process once before when my son was 15 months old and was doing awesome!!! he was going about 4-6 times a day in his potty, he would tell me he had to pee pee and we were having maybe one accident a day . i was so proud of him. we started because i was pregnant with my second pregnancy . unfortunately i had a miscarriage a month later and i got depressed and stopped. i gave up on my son and his accomplishment, i gave up on my own goals and i feel like i let my son and husband down because i told my husband we could do it, i could it. i was weak and i feel like i failed. well, now we are starting back and my son absolutely will not go potty with me. i will ask and he will say no, no, no and will run off. he hides when he poops now and i know he's ready. but he absolutely will not go use his potty. i've tried treats and rewarding words, making a big deal about, everything i feel like he won't go on it because mommy will give up again. i guess i'm looking for any advice and help. pinterest isn't much help. has anyone else been in a situation like this? what worked or helped. sorry for the mild rant and wall of text. tldr;started potty training son at 15 months, was awesome at it. got depressed and stopped. now son is two and hates using his potty, bribery won't help. needing advice and help.	cwalker13	/r/Mommit/comments/4gv0dn/help_advice_on_potty_training/	13	15	0	1.0	1461863790.0
how many csections have you had?	yesterday for my 31 week dr appointment my dr asked if we planned on having another baby after this one. i said we definitely are going to try for a third baby. possibly 4 but that's a little too far ahead right now. she said the risk after 3 cesareans that my uterus could attach to my scar tissue or other problems goes way up. my first son was a csection because my labor wasn't progressing and his heart rate was dropping. he wasn't gonna come out at 9lb 4oz! so with this next boy we are having a scheduled one. husband can take off work, no overdue 10 days like the first time. it's fine with me. cuz apparently it's hard to find a dr that will go along with a vbac anyways. i've looked into how many you can safely have. of course everyone is different. i healed well and pretty quickly too. i'm only 28 and i try my best to exercise and eat healthy. i do have diastasis recti and endometriosis. so i just want to hear from some of you other moms. if you've had a csection, how many? or if you've had a vbac too? share your stories if you like.	kitkatkelly_	/r/Mommit/comments/4gvqjg/how_many_csections_have_you_had/	66	20	0	0.92	1461872768.0
x-post from /r/daddit - traveling next week for the first time on virgin - dc to la. need help with car seat on the plane.	one year old child. we got him a seat on the plane. this is his car seat virgin's traveling with children website the car seat that we own has an 18.5 by 22 footprint. virgin's website says that car seats cannot exceed 17 by 17 the problem is that i cannot even find a cheapo car seat that fits those dimensions even if i wanted to buy another car seat. it seems to me that the car seats have gotten bigger over the years and airlines have not adjusted their requirements? for those of you who have traveled with children on a plane, and have put them in their car seat, have the airlines given you any hassle about the size of the seat? i will be x-posting this around on a few other subreddits. thanks in advance for your time!

need advice re birthday party	hi mamas, ok, so my son is 4.5 and has just been invited to his first real birthday party for a kid on his tee ball team. a bit about our family we relocated to a new state 2 years ago, i'm a wahm, and both my husband and i are super introverted and somewhat anti-social in that we don't really go out of our way to make friends, so we haven't met many new people here. tee ball is the first thing our son has been involved in that he's made some friends and i would like to not screw it up for him by being awkward and weird. the invitation said text or call your rsvp, so i texted the mom and let her know our son would be attending. then i asked what was probably a stupid, weird question - did she prefer the parents remained, or just dropped the kids off? her response was that families were more than welcome to stay, but just let her know how many to expect so she had an accurate count for food. the party is at her home. the more i think about it, the more anxious and awkward i feel because she probably thinks i'm some weird hovermom that doesn't trust her to watch our kid at a birthday party. on the other hand, hosting 15 4-5 year olds is probably a daunting task so maybe she would like some extra moms around to help? i am also worried that if we stay, my husband and i will be the weird people just sitting away from everyone sort of waiting for it to be over, since we really don't engage ourselves much. gah. his first party invitation and i'm already being a freak about it. anyways, moms that have hosted parties before, what do y'all think? is it more appropriate to just drop our kid off, or to stick around? will we be weird if we stay? the invite does not specify an end time.	not_a_muggle	/r/Mommit/comments/4hnsje/need_advice_re_birthday_party/	13	9	0	0.92	1462289373.0

how do i keep this up as a sahm?	i have been a sahm for almost 8 years and during that time i have not had a car or friends i was close enough to so i could see them, or they visit me often. then about 4 years ago we moved so far away i had no friends at all. i feel like i have no life anymore. i have absolutely no social life. all i really do is clean and cook and play video games. i love crafting, but my craft space is dark and cramped and with a toddler nearly impossible to fund time for. i hardly ever leave the house to the point getting the car to get to the store is hard. i tried to do a board game night once a week, but if i didn't set it up to meet people i knew then i was just an awkward party of one with no one willing to let me join. my days are so boring i nap so i have something to take up time. i feel like i am on the verge of fading away into nothing. getting out is just not possible. been wanting to do more, but space money and ability are major issues. i feel stuck and completely the agent of others. i don't have my own life i have little to no control over my day to day and i am getting desperate to feel that i exist in the world and have a life that some aspect i am in control of. how do i make my life have meaning when i am stuck in the same 7 rooms all day every day?

taking our littles to sesame place this summer- any tips? suggestions?	we decided that before we take the plunge to disney, we would try out sesame place this summer . for those of you who are unaware, sp is a sesame street theme park outside of philly. we live near syracuse ny and have family in philly, so financially, this will be an easy first theme park adventure. that being said, i've done a bunch of research on going to disney and how to make it enjoyable/cost effective. our daughter and our son can both get through the day without naps. our daughter is potty trained and our son is not. i am hoping he will be when we go, but i'll deal with that when we get to it. we travel often, so they are good with that aspect. i'm really wondering about when we're at the park. here are things i have so far -we are going on a wednesday to avoid weekend crowds -we plan on bringing in food and water bottles for the family -i am going to buy a few souvenirs ahead of time and surprise our littles with them the day of does anyone have any other tips? i'm especially wondering about the water park and when we should attempt that. my kids love the water, so that will be a must. any advice/tips are greatly appreciated! thanks in advance!	fancymamalancy	/r/Mommit/comments/4kqum2/taking_our_littles_to_sesame_place_this_summer/	15	19	0	1.0	1464045515.0

how do you discuss religion with your kids if you're not religious?	i have been putting this off for awhile, but my daughter asks incredible questions and really integrates everything that she hears from an adult as a fact. for example, tonight she said mommy, did you know that god drew everything that is in the world that a machine didn't make? he drew it like a map and then made it. she and her twin brother have said other things that i know they have heard from people close to us, or possibly kids at school. they seem to sense that i am uncomfortable when i ask who they learned it from, and they won't really fess up, which is fine. so far, i have told them that religions are very common and a lot of the people that we know probably follow one. and they have different things that they believe to be true, but mommy doesn't believe a lot of those things. in my heart, i want them to be critical and have scientific minds, which i feel they are developing really well. i pointed out all of the science that they learned this year. they had a big unit on pollination, so i tried to tie that in by getting them to see how nature creates things all by itself. sometimes this feels way too heavy for 7 year olds, though. does anyone think i'm explaining it incorrectly or have any other ideas? i was raised catholic, went through all private schools, and we even married in the church. it is fairly recent, in the scope of my 31 years, that i am not practicing a religion or have any interest in it. would love any help!

how important is tracking for feeding, etc, in babies?	not a parent yet, but we're working on it. i keep seeing ads for tracking apps, or recommended ways to track development, feeding, pooping, whatever else. i've never been that good with lists or organization, so i'm worried about starting and stopping. i managed having 12 rats and remembering all their different habits, feeding schedules, diets, behaviors, medical shedules and health issues just using my brain. i knew when something was up. is it so different with one child? i'm not talking about amount of care, babies are obviously going to be more and different, but scheduling and such. i'm a bit scared that i might not be cut out for parenting if it's something essential and i can't grasp it. i just can't keep up with lists and apps. i wanted to know in advance, is it really crucial? or can i get away with just living day to day? please be gentle with me, i know i probably have no idea what i'm talking about but you guys are the nicest group i could think to ask.		/r/Mommit/comments/4lsyzd/how_important_is_tracking_for_feeding_etc_in/	26	12	0	1.0	1464661439.0
how were each of your following pregnancies? nervous about trying for a third	i thought this may be the best place for this. my 2nd is nearing 4 months so while it won't be right around the corner i am already thinking about if and when a third baby could be a possibility. it is on my mind a lot because i am really nervous a third pregnancy could be terrible. i've dealt with horrible morning sickness with both requiring medication. first time around i got better in the 2nd trimester and no other issues. 2nd time around was so much rougher only made worse by having a young toddler. my back ached throughout most of it and by the end the pain was terrible and i could hardly sleep and move around. i had my husband help me with my pants and socks frequently because i couldn't move enough to put them on. i was attached to a heating pad. i had some breathing trouble early on that resolved but was my first er trip. i caught two severe stomach bugs that sent me back to the hospital. one of those i was treated to stop preterm labor. i had measurable contractions pretty much daily from about 20 weeks on. while i was a v bac this time around so no surgery to recover from delivery has left its own issues this time. healing from a tear comes with its own fun. this time my hair is falling out in larger clumps than it ever did before and i've developed mothers wrist so basically tendonitis. baby 2 is so easy going and a joy to be around that i'm not sure if i want to be done, but i am terrified if the trend continues a third pregnancy will only be worse and there would be 2 kids to take care of. did anyone else have later pregnancies turn out to be easier or harder? i know each time is different but i can only see it going worse. i can't picture the good parts of pregnancy anymore besides getting to meet a new lo at the end. thanks for letting me get this out there and maybe get some different perspectives	rmc1848	/r/Mommit/comments/4mdxl4/how_were_each_of_your_following_pregnancies/	12	13	0	0.94	1464974185.0
advice. sil is requesting family at the hospital for the birth. do i have to go? is that normal?	not sure if this is the right place to ask, but i figured who better to ask than moms! my brother and sil are expecting their first child. my family is very low key and private; hers is not. her family is large andspends a great deal of time together. my parents are separated and re-married and we tend to be a lot more independent. i made the assumption that i would see the baby after they had gotten it home from the hospital and gotten settled in. i did not under any circumstances want to assume that i would be welcome at the hospital or just show up. i genuinely had no expectation that i would be at the hospital.i live 4.5 hours away and work full time, and me personally i wouldn't want anyone at the hospital. today my brother informed me that my sil is expecting family to be at the hospital, and wants them to be there. i was a little surprised that she wanted people there and that they would want time to settle in before visitors. my brother sounded a bit peeved that i had scheduled a trip after the due date , and then complained that both of my parents, who live 3 hours away, had instructed my brotherto call them the following morning if she goes into laborin the middle of the night and said if my nephew was born on a weekday, they would try to come the following weekend. he seemed genuinely devastated that they were not, in his words, more excited about this. was i wrong to not assume that i would be required to be at the hospital? how long am i supposed to stay if i go? do i hang out in the waiting room all day and stay in a hotel at night while i wait for the baby to be born, then stay on until the family is released? what happens when they're ready to go home? do i go with them too and then stand around awkwardly while they try to settle him in? do i drive 4.5 hours, hold him, and drive back? and what about the unpaid leave i have to take . am i being unreasonable? this is the first baby in our family and i have no idea what the protocol is. is it rude of me to not be planning to drop everything and drive to another state at a moment's notice? as moms who've been through the hospital and birth experience, what do you think should i do?

momming is gross, need advice!	i just had to coach my 7 month old through the delivery of a painful poop. he is mainly breastfed, but he eats solids now, mainly fruit and veg purees and probiotic yogurt. when he is constipated i give him prunes, but is there anything i can give him to just soften things up? i had heard apple juice might help? i would rather head to the grocery store instead of the drug store for a solution to his gastric problem.

ftm need advice 10 w/o is hysterical whenever i leave her with mil	ftm and my baby girl is about 10 weeks. everytime i leave her with my mil she is a mess when i get home. i read that seperation anxiety isn't a thing until 6-9 months but she seems to already have this issue. when i leave her she is still at our apartment so it's not a change of scenery for her. she usually sleeps 5-7 hours a night but if i leave her with my mil for even an hour she is hysterical that night and will only sleep if i'm holding her. she is ebf but my mil gives her a bottle of expressed milk. she gets 1 bottle a day everyday from my husband so i dont think the bottle is causing it. for example, yesterday i left her with mil from 5-6 30pm so i could go to a workout class . she took her bottle at 5 30 and was totally fine when i got home. around 11 p.m. when i tried to put her down for the night she would scream unless i held her, my husband couldn't even calm her down. around 4am i gave up and slept with her on my chest until about 7 . this is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened and each time its days when i asked my mil to babysit for an hour or so. i am desperate for help. i can't leave the house without an immense amount of guilt/ dread because i know its going to be a rough night when i return. i'm supposed to leave her with mil for 8 hours next saturday to go to a concert w my husband a few towns over and i am so anxious and worried about it. did anyone else go through something like this when your baby was this young?	easm214	/r/Mommit/comments/4nhikd/ftm_need_advice_10_wo_is_hysterical_whenever_i/	19	5	0	0.78	1465580910.0
for everyone struggling through the early years, it can be a lot of fun when your kids get older	one of my daughters is currently apprenticing as a chef. not only is she kicking butt and taking names, but the food that she brings home at the end of the night is awesome. she also just finished a 3 week solo tour of europe, which went off without a hitch. 2 of my kids have autism, and their future is so much brighter than i'd ever envisioned. there are certainly still frustrations with young adults , but it's much better than i'd ever thought it would be. hang in there. i still love babies and toddlers and primary kids, but having adult children is just so interesting, and fun. the time is going to pass before you know it.	aenea	/r/Mommit/comments/4njk55/for_everyone_struggling_through_the_early_years/	16	74	0	0.97	1465609937.0

um. how much is an 11 month old supposed to eat?	my 11 month old is a vacuum; it seems she spends all. day. eating. she eats tortillas, peanut butter sandwiches, crabcakes, those plum squeeze packs, she'll drink formula, eat soft veggies, chicken, anything and everything. if you're eating or snacking she's right there next to you, trying to grab whatever you're eating. is this normal? i mean, she's of normal weight ... do i just let her eat and eat and eat and eat?? let me add - about a week ago she started walking full time, so she spends 95% of her time walking and 5% of her time crawling. maybe walking is more demanding?		/r/Mommit/comments/4o3bh3/um_how_much_is_an_11_month_old_supposed_to_eat/	10	22	0	1.0	1465934147.0

newbie question how do you share photos with close friends and family?	hi moms! i have a 2 week old infant and i am already getting tired of emailing and texting photos to grandparents and others and i know they want to see even more than i can manage to send i'd rather not post a ton of photos of my baby to my facebook page. not only because i want to be discreet with his online exposure, but also because i lost my first son and am extremely sensitive to those who have suffered from loss and/or infertility. i am considering doing a secret fb group, but not everyone who wants to see photos is on facebook. i've looked at tiny beans, but you have to pay to upload multiple photos at once. what websites and apps work for you? any advice welcome. for the record, i am comfortable sharing freely with select people, and i suppose it would be added bonus if others could post their own photos of him as well? i just don't want to do it in a super public forum. thanks in advance. and here is some baby tax edit- clarity.	bethechangeyouwish	/r/Mommit/comments/4opt8z/newbie_question_how_do_you_share_photos_with/	21	11	0	0.8	1466276592.0

ruined father's day for dh/feeling lonely 	my husband went out of his way for my first mother's day last month. got me a wonderful gift and we had brunch. we spent the day together. for his first father's day, i got him a great gift. my dad called me a few days prior asking if i wanted to get together like we usually do. i said yes. i mentioned to my husband that dad and i would have lunch together and we could have some alone time together when baby takes a nap and go out for dinner afterwards. so lunchtime rolls around and dad and i go out. we end up going to a festival for a few hours. i didn't think it'd be a problem since baby usually naps for a few hours in the afternoon. meanwhile, i'm getting texts from my husband saying that i'm spending all of the day with my dad and that this must be what being a single father feels like. i hadn't checked my phone until we were done around 3. i thought i'd be able to come back and spend some quality alone time with him while baby naps. no such luck. he's very hurt and upset with me. i try to initiate sex to make it up to him but he isn't the mood . i ask him what i can do to make it up to him. he said that i shouldn't have to make it up to him and that what i did was wrong. i mention that we can still go out to dinner and try to get some time after baby is asleep. we go out to dinner but end up getting back an hour after baby's bedtime. she is overtired and doesn't want to sleep in the crib. i'm trying my best to soothe her but she cries as soon as i put her down. we're still arguing about the day and i ask him what i should do about baby. husband comes in and soothes her to sleep on our bed. by this point, it's 9 pm and i'm tired . i end up going to sleep with baby. husband comes in around 1 30 am, as usual. today he's barely spoken to me. we normally text throughout the day but i haven't seen anything. i'm so upset about this whole thing. on top of that, i feel lonely. i go to work, come home to tend to baby, clean house and go to sleep. rinse and repeat. i'm starting to hate where we live. it's a small one bedroom and we just don't have room for anything anymore. he does watch baby during the day but i just feel like it isn't enough. i'm the one that cleans and works. he watches baby, drives/errands and cooks. i don't drive so it's not easy to get around. most of my friends are busy with their own lives and don't live nearby. i don't have a relationship with my mom due to her mental health issues so it means a lot to me when my dad and i can get together because i finally get out of the house without baby. i guess husband wanted to know why i didn't invite him and baby with to the festival. tbh, i really wanted some alone time with my dad and it was too hot for baby to be out. i'm not really sure where i'm going with this. i want to know if there's something i can do to fix the father's day fiasco with my husband. if there's a way to combat the loneliness too. i'm sorry if i'm rambling. help is appreciated.	throwawayfathersday2	/r/Mommit/comments/4p0v9h/ruined_fathers_day_for_dhfeeling_lonely_ventadvice/	15	7	0	0.73	1466455179.0

x-post from r/beyondthebump i want another baby but i'm terrified of being pregnant again! help!	this is a throw-a-way for obvious reasons. i also posted in r/beyondthebump to reach more internet moms so i'm sorry for the duplicate post if you are subscribed to both! i need to vent and want advice. so, i have a beautiful 18 month old daughter. she is so smart and talkative for her age, she is well-mannered and kind most of the time. everything that you would want for your little toddler! then why not have a dozen just like her, right? well, while i was pregnant i swore i was never going to do this again. i would be one and done. i was miserable. i hated being pregnant and feeling tired all the time. i was working full time night shift as a nurse and my husband was doing free-lance work but seemed like he was never working. i completely resented my husband and felt like everything was one sided. i felt like i was doing all the work. now, i am working on dayshift in a much less physically demanding department. my husband watches our daughter while i work 3 days a week and he is still free-lance . i know watching a little one is hard work but i still feel like our workload is not balanced. add the hormones of pregnancy in there and i am sure i will go back to the hatred i felt for my husband with the first pregnancy. on top of everything else, when our daughter was born, we had a complicated delivery and at the moment she was born i didn't know if she was going to make it. it was so scary. thankfully, she was fine but she did end up in nicu for a week. that first week of her life was a nightmare and something i never want to relive. i think i have some sort of post-traumatic stress related to her birth experience and still get emotional when i talk about it. but before i got pregnant the first time i wanted a fairly large family and i get a lot of so when are you having another one? from friends and family. i would love to grow my family but i'm terrified of the pregnancy experience. i'm afraid that i will regret not having more children later. thank you for reading my vent of a post! i need help! what should i do?

nothing like admitting to people who hate you that you can't take care of your kid. i'm so upset right now.	my daughter contracted hfmd from a kid in our neighborhood and i only noticed the symptoms last night after brushing her teeth. i noticed it hurt her to brush her teeth so i looked in her mouth and she had the blisters. i called her ped and they said just to make sure she stays hydrated with pedialyte if she won't drink anything and to give her tylenol and ibuprofen. that was all fine and well last night, i could comply, except i didn't have pedialyte. but, she took the tylenol and was able to drink so, she was fine. this morning, i realized i had no more tylenol. she wouldn't eat or drink anything and she has huge blisters around her lady bits. i still don't have pedialyte. so, i did the only thing i could think of next. i called her dad to come get her. and i started crying on the phone because i feel like the worst mom ever. i'm still crying because i feel like the worst mom ever.

tv... i feel like a bad mom. advice?	tl;dr. 13 mo. is healthy and happy but drops everything now to watch tv. i let her because i need down time... or im lazy. ok so i will start off by saying that i have always had the tv on in the background. i just find it comforting. when my baby was born i binge watched netflix while nursing and i just continued to leave the tv on in the back ground whenever we are at home. my daughter is 13 months now. for the longest time she mostly ignored the tv. she would play, eat facing away from it and so on. recently though she has gotten fascinated with it and its making me feel like i made a huge mistake. she always ignored the tv so it felt harmless, but now when it is on she won't eat, play or anything. she just sits and stares. i know it isn't healthy but i am tempted let her watch tv like that for an hour while i did all my dishes, sweeping etc. i read an article today saying it damages kids by not allowing them the focus to explore their surroundings or use their imagination. it can also apparently limit speech progress and result in emotional problems? i dunno. i have suffered from moderate/severe anxiety, mild depression and chronic fatigue for years. i think i am allowing myself to let her sit in front of the tv because i am the type of person that needs alone time or down time. maybe i am lazy. i don't know. to give some context to this problem, she seems fine. she eats a varied healthy diet, is almost never sick. loves exploring the living room, hallway and her bedroom which are all babyproofed. she naps once a day for 3 hours and sleeps 12 hours at night. shes about as happy as a toddler gets but i want what is best for her. any suggestions? is tv really that bad? i am a post grad university student with evening classes and i work every weekend and holiday as a cleaner at a hospital. i get a bit of a break on the evenings and weekends when my husband takes care of my daughter but messes dont bother him so i clean pretty much everything and make dinners too. help.

advice for toddler needing baby route canal	long time reader of mommit and now need some advice. finally brought my toddler to see at dentist. he turned 4 in march. why it took so long, i have no answers. my husband and i see a dentist regularly - so it's not something we fear or did not value. i feel like i have failed to protect my toddler. poor guy has lots of cavities. he has one large one on his lower back left molar and will need a baby route canal. his two front teeth also have cavities, brown patches, which we thought were just stains. we brush his teeth twice a day - but without flouride toothpaste, since he didn't like the taste. he will need to be put under general anesthesia for the procedure. any other parents out there, whose child needed major dental work and had to be sedated at a young age? what questions should i ask? how did your child respond to the anesthesia? what can we do before or after the procedure to keep him comfortable? did anyone get second opinions? we now brush with flouride toothpaste and use flouride coated floss. he complains, but this is what he needs. thank you in advance for all the support and advice.

4 year old in teeball...not what i expected.	so my 4 years old daughter, she turned 4 in may, started teeball this year. she was so excited about getting to play and loves to hit the ball and play catch at home. the games have been a whole other story. i expected drawing in the dirt, i expected not being really focused, what i have gotten has been to a whole other extreme. you blink and she's run off to the gate at the back of the field. when the other team is batting she's running around chasing the other runners. she has even started laying down on the field in the middle of the game. tonight was her 4th game and it was the worst experience we've had so far. she was in a total different world for the entirety of the game. any advice on what to do?? do i just pull her out?? has anyone else experiencedo this with their kids, please say yes! i feel so alone and surprised with her actions.	vikingpirategirl	/r/Mommit/comments/4q6sq4/4_year_old_in_teeballnot_what_i_expected/	12	18	0	0.81	1467076126.0

so.. i don't know how i feel about explaining to my two year old that i smoke..	she recently figured out that when i go outside i smoke, but she doesn't know the correct term for it. she asked me earlier if i went outside to go burn myself since i smelled like smoke.. i don't know if i should explain to her, hide and do whatever it is to keep it away from her or explain to her or hide. or explain to her or hide. or keep smoking or stop smoking.. i'm super emotional and uncomfortable about it. what do you guys suggest? i know its considered lying if i hide it from her. the thing here is that she's very smart and i don't want to lie, but i don't want to tell her... explain to her or have her lose respect for me. i'm uncomfortable.	wittykat	/r/Mommit/comments/4r19sp/so_i_dont_know_how_i_feel_about_explaining_to_my/	35	40	0	0.86	1467534918.0
any bedsharers transition to big kid beds and when?	my 14 month old sleeps with us and he is starting to take up way too much room. he's a big boy. he also likes to sleep on top of me so my back is killing me . he nurses a ton and nurses to sleep. i'm thinking about getting him a big boy bed where i can lay with him and nurse him to sleep. i think he may do better with that because he won't smell me. currently i nurse him to sleep and then leave him in our bed and he sleeps well until i come in. any thoughts or personal experience? my concern is that we'll be pushing the weight limit on most beds i think he would like with the two of us and the mattress.	yogaposer	/r/Mommit/comments/4r1ftl/any_bedsharers_transition_to_big_kid_beds_and_when/	4	2	0	0.67	1467539413.0
what flea medicine is safe to use with toddlers around?	hi moms! our golden retriever has fleas. i was hoping someone here has a recommendation for treatment! in the past we've used the topical medicine that goes on the neck and flea collars, but i don't like the thought of that with a toddler in the house, since you're always supposed to wash hands after touching the dog then, and i don't know about chasing him down every time he wants to pet or hug the dog.... we've done a flea shampoo, but it didn't seem to do anything. grateful for any other suggestions! thanks!

looking for advice with friend and his kid.	my husband has a friend that he used to work with. he's pretty timid, kind of anti social and has a 3yo boy. friend and the mother are separated and have zero communication. yesterday they came over and friend basically sat in the chair playing on his laptop while his kid rip-roared through our home. now i don't mind that he plays with our daughters toys, that's what they're there for . but holy crap guys. this poor kid clearly does not get attention or at least the attention he needs and deserves and is likely hardly disciplined. the friend would mildly say 'don't do that' or to stop doing something, but never actually stopped him. husband had to. the one thing that made me the most upset is he was being really rough with our cat after constantly telling him not to be. so my question to you ladies is, how does my husband talk to the friend about this? how does one go about telling someone else to pay attention to their kid..but maybe not quite in that way?

looking for honest advice regarding cloth diapers being too bulky and limiting movement of baby	ftm here and i have a 9 week old baby girl. we decided to use cloth diapers with her before she was even born. 7 weeks in we had to use disposables for a bit because i needed to bleach my diaper inserts due to mildew . while she was in disposables i noticed that she can relax her legs flat on the bed in froggy position. she can also lift her legs a lot more compared to when she was in cloth. we were really impressed by how high she can lift her head up during tummy time while in disposables. when we went back to using cloth diapers and started doing tummy time with her again, she had such a difficult time lifting her head and would just give up. i also noticed that her leg would be hanging in the air at night when she sleeps because the diaper would make her bum too bulky. i'm also concerned about how tight i have to pull and snap the cloth diapers on her waist and hip or else she would start leaking. now i am having second thoughts about using cloth because i am scared that it may delay her development and i would not be able to catch it in time. just wondering if i should just give up cloth and just use disposables.	tygrana	/r/Mommit/comments/4svcpr/looking_for_honest_advice_regarding_cloth_diapers/	19	9	0	0.74	1468527221.0
hand, foot, and mouth disease in the house. how best to sanitize toys?	so baby girl has hand, foot, and mouth disease . luckily, beyond some owie looking sores on her chin and some uncharacteristic grumpiness, it doesn't seem to be bothering her too badly. however, she's at that teething stage where everything goes in her mouth. nothing is safe. so, i know i need to sanitize all her multitudes of toys. stuffed animals are easy, chuck them in the washing machine. hard plastic/non-electronic toys, chuck them in the dishwasher. easy enough. but what about soft plastic toys, electronic toys, and wooden toys? those can't be put in a machine, so how do you all recommend sanitizing them? i've seen recommendations of spraying them down with vinegar and water or dunking them in a diluted bleach solution, but i'd love to hear your ideas, too. also, any recommendations on how to make baby girl more comfortable besides tylonel? thank you so much!

ferber from co-sleeping when your baby still falls asleep night nursing?	not looking for any judgment on how terrible ferber is. she is a year old and still wakes up 7+ times a night to nurse. pantley hasn't worked, bedtime fading hasn't worked. we've taken the sears approach with co-sleeping because it worked, but now.. we have to figure something else out. so lo is one year old next week... since she was 5 months we've co-slept with her because she was the sleepless wonder and it was the only way to get this child some good sleep during her first year. and it was nice--i nursed her to sleep for all of her naps and bedtime because it just worked for us. but she's almost a year old, she's got a ton of teeth, and is still waking up a lot at night... the other night it was 9 times, and she's not sick or teething or anything right now. i need sleep and even more than that, this child needs uninterrupted sleep. we started ferber 3 nights ago. she's been doing great at first. she protests for about 5 minutes then chats with her stuffed animals 'til she goes to sleep. then she wakes up anywhere from 1-2 hours later. before, any time she'd wake up, she'd already be in the bed, and i'd just nurse her back to sleep. but now i go to her crib, pick her up, nurse her, then she just... falls asleep in bed. i tried nursing her in my arms to see if the bed was the problem, and she just... falls asleep. now, i know you're supposed to put them back in the crib awake, but... for her the association is so strong... like, the minute she latches onto the breast during these night wakings her eyes are closed. she's never even woken up fully when she night nurses unless she doesn't get the boob immediately, then she fully wakes up. do i set her down asleep in the crib, only for her to wake up when she's down in the crib and get upset, or do i wake her up before i put her in the crib? i don't know what to do. last night was night 4 and it was worse than ever with the night wakings. i don't feel like dr. ferber's book is very clear on night nursing in this situation. anyone had any experience with this? thanks mamas!	catfoodforever	/r/Mommit/comments/4txzll/ferber_from_cosleeping_when_your_baby_still_falls/	22	5	0	0.7	1469120132.0

i must be doing it wrong, i need advice	my 2 year old little boy has only slept through the night 3 times. from the time we wake up we do consistent activities and meal times. i've had the same bedtime routine with him since 5 or 6 months and it's not helped. recently he started taking 1 to 2 hours to put to bed, i did some online reading and thought it might be a little early but i've started cutting out nap time. when bedtime comes he's tired and now goes right to sleep. the last 2 weeks he's progressively been a little less fussy about it every day so i thought maybe i fixed the problem. but now the last 2 days he's completely exhausted to the point he's falling asleep anywhere he sits down around 1 or 2 in the afternoon thus making it once again impossible to get him to sleep. i know some kids are just crappy sleepers but i'm worried about his health. the doctor says to let him cry it out but obviously at 2 there's no way to contain him in a bed. he's been able to climb out of his crib since 11 months so i coslept until a couple months before having my 2nd. even co sleeping he would wake up in the middle of the night every night so nothing has changed there. any advice would be greatly appreciated...i don't know what i'm doing wrong	kurplunc	/r/Mommit/comments/4ush2d/i_must_be_doing_it_wrong_i_need_advice/	9	1	0	0.67	1469587718.0

i thought who would know better than mothers? - should i try to get pregnant?	firstly, if this is the wrong place for this, just say so and i'll delete this and ask somewhere else. secondly, a brief history last year, at 42, i was diagnosed with the autism spectrum disorder formerly known as asperger's; and over the last two years my life has gone from just utter crap to a fair approximation of normalcy. being a parent was never an option before, because finances wouldn't allow it. now we, , own our house, free and clear. he has a decent job, and i'm building a little retail business online around my art. finding out that my perpetual pursuit of a regular job was pointless, and filing for ssi instead, has completely turned my life around. relocating to a better part of the country helped a lot, too. but now, of course, i'm 43, with about a 25% chance of genetic disorders if i get pregnant. and my mother always told me, growing up, you don't need kids . her other kids, she really looked forward to having grandkids by, but not me. she's always said i'm not mature. and that's true. my iq is above average, but emotionally i'm more like fourteen, and always will be. when one of my cats passes away, i bawl for hours, curled up in my room. on rare occasion, with a sick pet, or after a bad argument with my mom, the meltdowns do include hitting my head against the wall. on the other hand, we have a three bedroom house, with a fenced yard, in a quiet neighborhood. i've babysat in years past, and always had a lot of fun with kids. their parents often seemed irritated when they came to get them, though, because i play with kids rather than watching them, whatever that means. kids can boss me around, to an extent, and i agree to things that their parents don't, like opening a bunch of boxes of stored stuff all over the basement, and crank calling 1-800 numbers. the husband is neurotypical. he's a very calm, considerate person. he cooks dinner ever night after work. he smokes, but that's the only negative thing i can think of about him. he would very probably be the sole voice of reason in the house, if we had a kid. i hesitate to say that he'd be essentially parenting both me and the child, but to an extent, that would probably be true. neither of us has any family or friends anywhere nearby, so it would just be us taking care of the baby. that said, i'm a serious animal lover and i've bottle raised a lot of little critters over the years, and lost a lot of sleep getting up every four hours to care for sick kittens, so i think i'd be alright there. i am, like most aspies, honest to a fault. i have strong principles, and i remember well all of the supportive things my father used to say to me. i believe i could pass along a strong sense of personal pride, decent morals, and self confidence. i love holdays, and i especially go all out decorating for halloween and christmas. never having really grown up myself, i love kites and carnivals and lego and video games and so on. i'm guessing that's a positive thing. i don't want just supportive comments, made for the sake of being supportive. i need the honest opinions of people with experience raising small children. my life feels empty and i'd really like to be a parent, but i honestly don't know if it's a good idea. i've tried to be as brutally honest about my situation as i can. have at me.

stuffie is gone for good, now what? 	so, 10 year old brought his absolute favorite stuffie when traveling with us to australia . well, toward the end of our trip we notice the stuffy is gone, along with some others. i've contacted every hotel to no avail and looking back at pictures has lead me to believe that airport security took them out and didn't put them back. i found two of the three big ones at ikea, but his absolute favorite was bought at a cvs eight years ago and is gone forever. he's old enough to be okay that nightlight is on a walkabout, but has been crying whenever he remembers it. he feels guilty because i warned him about bringing stuffies such a long way. i've tried every store and every search for a bean-stuffed orange kitten. he's too old for a sub-par replacement. this one is lost forever. what do i do? what can i say? i feel terrible!	zap1000x	/r/Mommit/comments/4woylf/stuffie_is_gone_for_good_now_what_age_10/	10	6	0	0.76	1470640846.0
ftm wondering about newborn sleeping arrangements . looking for advice	my head is spinning lately with all the sleeping options for newborn. i've combed through the weeds and think i have a better plan. all of my friends have had their newborns sleep in rock n plays from the beginning. if thats the only thing my baby will sleep in, fine. but i don't particularly want to start with the rnp since i've read a few things i don't particularly like. i'd like to try a bassinet. i like the idea of the lullago bassinet. is this ok for everyday use? i don't want to throw tons of money on a bassinet that might not be used . i'm also trying to find things secondhand, but live in a smaller town. any advice out there?	elsynkala	/r/Mommit/comments/4wytn3/ftm_wondering_about_newborn_sleeping_arrangements/	35	30	0	0.93	1470780459.0
toddler tantrums how to handle them in public?	every time we're out in public my 1.5 year old son decides to have some form of a freak out about something. when i tell him no and try to explain why he shouldn't act that way and try and fix whatever is making him act out he tries to slap me, takes my glasses off and throws them on the freaking ground! how the heck am i supposed to react to this?! his dad is about to swat his little butt, but i'm trying so hard to not spank. momgulitisreal but seriously guys, help me out. what do you do to discipline your littles in public? i should add that he can't talk yet.	bmora_kc	/r/Mommit/comments/4wzg79/toddler_tantrums_how_to_handle_them_in_public/	6	6	0	0.88	1470788764.0
 how can i make my wife feel sexy, confident, and beautiful after our first child?	our first child, a boy, was born yesterday. we are both very excited to be parents and to raise our adorable new son, jonah. however, this whole thing has got me absolutely scared to death over our sex life. i keep reading stories about couples who had to wait like 6 months, 9 months, a year, before they could even have sex semi-comfortably again. my wife had a not-too-big 3rd degree tear, which the mid-wife described as being pretty typical, but this again adds to my fears of our sex life vanishing for the next 8 months. that's a long freaking time. sex is by far the primary way i feel loved and appreciated. i feel pretty down after only 5-7 days with no sex. oh gosh, this is going to be terrible. i'm not gonna make it! ... anyway, now that my panic attack is over... intertwined with these stories of prodigal sex-lives were stories of how it took a while for momma to have a sex drive again simply because they were so diffident about their post-partum body, felt gross, etc etc. so, i decided that rather than focus on the terrifying possibilities, i would focus on doing my best to keep my wife from feeling down about herself. so, women who have had children and gone through this, what can i do to make my wife feel sexy? more accurately, what can i do to let her know that i still think she's sexy? thanks in advance!		/r/Mommit/comments/4x00jk/helpadvice_how_can_i_make_my_21_m_wife_20_f_feel/	18	0	0	0.36	1470796632.0
need advice about caring for child and home -- please	hello, my husband says i should never let our 2.5 year old out of my sight. he gets really worked up that i lock our child in the living room so i can do housework . he says i need to include our son in everything i do, even if it takes longer and that it should only take an hour to do housework, so he doesn't know what i do with my whole day since i'm a sahm. he often cites that millions of women do this without problems and i should stop acting stupid. so, i'm coming to you with a request for advice how do you do it? helping with laundry and general tidying up i understand, but the kitchen? -bathrooms? -floors? -cooking? addition info and husband help request i had never even held a baby or knew anyone with small children before i got pregnant and i don't have any family near-by to help me. my mom lives out of state, my step-mom is chronically ill, and my mil is an elderly snowbird. i lost contact with all my single friends from college. i tried to have lunches with them, but my husband complained that the housework was suffering and always out if i asked to use the truck more than twice a week. so eventually we just stopped meeting. however, my husband recently introduced me to another young mother he works with, so the play dates we've been setting up once a week that have been a ray of light!! also, when i talk about needing a break, he says he works 75 hours a week and he doesn't get a break . he handles it, like an adult, and he doesn't get to sleep 10 hours a day or hang around the house all day. he says i'm welcome to go back to work, if i can't handle taking care of our child, and then someone else can raise him, but that totally not what i want. he started complaining that he needed to hire a babysitter for his wife and i told him that's not what's said. since one-third of the work he does is at home, i just wanted him to watch our son while i wash dishes or put away laundry or take a phone call from my mom on my birthday -- but that is asking too much. he's doing the work of four people and can't be distracted. he also wants to know why i don't motivate him anymore or why i'm never in the mood for anything. its like i just don't care about him anymore, i only think about what i need. i'm not as happy as i use to be, but i'm not sad either. i'm not excited about our future as i use to be, but i still listen to him talk about the things he wants to do. i'm not unhappy, but i'm not the carefree 20 year old girl that inspired him to go after his dreams eight years ago. and the worst part is that i can't explain why i feel like this. i know my husband works his butt off for us, so it's unfair of me to ask for more time for me. especially since i have no time for him anymore, despite everything he does for me. i don't want to be ungrateful, he does do a lot for us he buys me flowers he's building me shelves for my books he buys the food and pays the bills he haggles with the medical insurance people and phone company he takes me to the bookstore for an hour every couple weeks and takes our son to get lunch he puts water in the inflatable pool so i can swim with our son he takes us to the park he gives our son showers he takes care of the yard and the truck he makes all the repairs around the house he says he just feels like we're more like business partners than anything. i've tried to get him to try to schedule some down-time for himself to de-stress, but he says he doesn't have any time to give and that's what he needs me for. what can i do? edit wow! i was not expecting these answers. i'll try to reply to everyone. my husband is off today and taking a nap....we had a pretty big fight today that ended with him telling me i shouldn't be parent; that i need to go get a job, so someone else can watch our child ; and i've pretty much ruined our marriage by going back on my promise ... so there's that. edit2 husband works tomorrow. i will have to reply more then. he's already said that this won't just go away and that he's waiting for me to talk to him about something, but i have no idea what he's talking about?? edit3 good morning. i'm not sure i can reply to everyone anymore, but i'll try to answer the ones with questions! we talked last night and worked it out a bit. he just wants to make sure i'm committed to the family and our plan for the future. he says i'm very important to him and making this whole thing work. if we are fighting, he can't perform his best at work and that will destroy everything we've worked for. i can't be a little girl anymore, that i need to start acting my age, and take care of my business --stop making excuses-- and if we don't want to be average just like every other family then i need to make some adjustments to my attitude. he's had to make sacrifices too. oh, and the the thing he was waiting for me to talk about was what my problem is and some proposed solutions. he says i have terrible communication and i need to start speaking up about what i want, before it becomes a problem. but that is kinda the problem i don't know what my problem is or how to solve it. what do i need? am i truly a bad mom because i go in and out of the room? is it a matter of bad time-management? is it a matter of being under-stimulated? -overwhelemed? -selfish? how do we come to terms with conflicting parenting styles without fighting? i feel as though i have tried to get us to go out and do things, but my husband always has reasons why we can't. mainly it's because he doesn't have time, but also the water park has urine in the water, the ball pit has needles in it, the zoo is hot and boring, the children's museum is full of snotty sick kids -- although he has gotten better. we have gone to a couple places now. although he usually doesn't want us to go new places without him and i don't want him to miss out on the fun either. also, to answer another question, no - i don't have a car. we sold it the week after our son was born. it saves us car and insurance payments.

need advise on how to deal with stressful, jealous, and controlling mothers. xpost from r/relationshipadvise	im posting this here bc it gets more traffic than r/daddit. i also posted it to relationship advice but wanted more of a parents point of view or maybe someone who has been in our shoes. sorry for the long post. so my wife is pregnant, about 5 weeks i think. we couldnt contain our excitement and told both our families almost immediately. my family lives in the same town as we do and we see them a lot, have dinner about once a week and are generally pretty close. her family lives in another state about 8 hrs away and we dont get to see them that often, but my wife talks to them on the phone several times a week. little bit of background info for you. 2 years ago we were supposed to get married. my wife doesnt have many close friends so was counting on my family and hers to help plan out the wedding. my mother took this and ran with it , admittingly being a somewhat controlling but had the best intentions of just trying to make us happy. her mom is a flake and very inconsistent so when you ask her to do something or if she says she is going to do something, it usually doesnt get done. so my wife did not put much on her moms plate in regards to planning the wedding. long story short, her mom constantly trashed my mom and family and got into my wifes head making her think the whole wedding was more for my mom to show off than for me and my wife. this upset my wife, and gave my mil the ammunition she needed to pressure my wife to call off the wedding. not for us to break up, just to cancel the wedding so my mom wouldnt get everything her way . it got to the point of my fil saying he would consider not being at the wedding bc he knew it was not what my wife wanted. these are just a few things that happened that led to my wife and i calling the ceremony off, which led to my family basically not speaking to us for 6 months. we ended up getting married in a very small ceremony the next year, with my wifes parents not present anyway. ok so fast forward another year. my wife and i have been trying to get pregnant since feb. our relationship with our families is back to normal. my family is excited about the possibility of a new baby. we tell my mom were pregnant, she is super happy, cries, hugs all the good stuff. we tell my mil were pregnant amd she says congrats and the second question she asks is how did shan take it? this upset my wife bc my mil has met my mom only twice and she could not understand why her mom could mot just be happy and in the moment. a few days go by and my parents are still super happy, talking about baby plans/ giving advice and what not. my mom mentions that she is going to put a nursery area in her new house they are building. my wife doesnt think anything of it and neither do i. my wife mentions this ofhandedly to her mom on the phone and her mom starts trying to get in my wifes head asking why shes putting a nursery in her house, were not really going to leave the baby there with her, shes probably going to insist on keeping the baby etc. this of course upsets my wife. she calls and is worried that my mom is going to start controlling everything again and its freaking us out. im trying to learn from previous mistakes and not give in to either of our mothers faults. i feel like my mil is extremely jealous of the time we spend with my family and is doing as mucb as she can to drive a wedge between my family and my wife. i dont know how i should handle this situation. im pissed that my mil is starting this again, but my wife is close to her and takes what she says to heart even if she knows what shes trying to do.

transitioning from smoothly pureed food to mashed food with bits in it... how?!?!	my daughter is now 6 months old and she has been eating pureed fruit and veggies since 4 months. she has been doing this really well from day one. but now that she's six months we want to switch from the smooth stuff to food with tiny chunks in it, so that she can learn to chew rather than 'slurp' it. the problem is...she spits out anything with texture! even if it is 99% mush and 1% tiny bits. and then after a few bites just keeps her mouth closed. we tried giving her a cooked carrot in her hand for her to munch on...but she hated it. tried the same thing with a piece of bread...freaked out as soon as it touched her lips. and this from the kid who tries to eat her toys and clothes p help! how do we transition her to more solid food over the next few months?	swirly023	/r/Mommit/comments/4y7dnc/transitioning_from_smoothly_pureed_food_to_mashed/	25	15	0	1.0	1471459732.0

i need advice. is it time to drop to one nap?	here's the deal my lo is still going down for her two naps okay. but we have to make sure to cap her morning nap so that she will be able to go down for her 2nd nap by 2 so that she's up by 3. even still, when we put her down at 7/7 30pm she rolls around until she falls asleep sometimes as late at 8 20. she doesn't cry, just moves around a bunch. the thing is she is tired and ready to go down for her first nap by 9am. if anything, it's the afternoon nap i can see her dropping.things aren't exactly broken but i'm wondering if she needs more awake time between her last nap and bed and if so how do i make that transition? and i'm nervous that is i try to make the transition i will break the good that i currently have.		/r/Mommit/comments/4z0g4o/i_need_advice_is_it_time_to_drop_to_one_nap/	8	13	0	1.0	1471871382.0
does anyone else's kid have extremely specific preferences that are a genetic trait to their own?	hi mommit! hope you all are doing well! i was just wondering how normal or common it is to pass on the gene to like or dislike foods and other preferences. maybe this is a better question for /askscience? for example, my child also hates the same foods as me, loves the same foods as me, and tolerates the same food as me. he has been exposed to them by family, his father, and restaurants but just doesn't like them. he also has the same taste in music. of course, it could be said its because that's what he has been exposed to by me- but he is very adamant about the particular songs are his favorite. and does not like any music his dad plays, which tend to be in the opposite spectrum as mine. the most recent discovery that made me giddy with excitement was his love for halloween and anything scary. i let him use the youtube kids app on my ipad and he always chooses the videos about halloween, ghosts, vampires, etc. i have always been interested in the occult, i'm pagan and off and on practice wicca, as well as have many get togethers with like-minded people . he has had no exposure to anything except for maybe looking over my shoulder to watch ghost hunting youtube videos. he turned 3 in april, so i doubt he has any memories of last halloween, even then we only went on a hayride at a local place and he was an ewok which isn't really scary lol. there isn't mention of religion to him by anyone that i know of, and especially not any kind of wicca, pagan, or the like. i know he is very young still, but he is a very expressive aries child that has been sure of himself since the day i brought him home from the hospital holding his own head up! he knows his preferences and isn't afraid to tell anyone what they are. i feel the eye rolls already, but i don't think every kid is like that and i know i wasn't. anyway, thank you ladies and i look forward to reading about your kiddies as well!

five weeks post partum - bleeding - is it normal? need some advice.	is it normal to still have bright red bleeding & cramping 5 weeks post partum?? background so i had my baby girl in late july....and i actually had a super easy delivery and because of this i was expecting an easy recovery. i stayed active my entire pregnancy , i didn't tear, and my baby girl was small. at 3 weeks post partum i was still bleeding heavily - not a pad an hour - but a lot and it was bright red. i was also having bad cramping and pain in my vagina. i ended up seeing an obgyn and they gave me a 5 day prescription for a medication that helps contract your uterus. the medicine did make me feel better and the bleeding slowed down. i went back to the doctor a week later and saw my regular obgyn. at the appointment , my bleeding had slowed down & my doctor gave me the go ahead for sex, exercise and everything else . i mentioned i was interested in the iud and he said they would do an ultrasound to check my uterus when i come in for that placement in a few weeks. now i'm 5 weeks post partum and today i've been bleeding bright red . i am also having bad cramping. is it normal to still have this going on 5 weeks post partum? has anyone else experienced this? i am ebf so i'm 99% sure this isn't my period. i don't want to be the person that keeps calling the doctor over and over for no reason 	KEH91	/r/Mommit/comments/5080c5/five_weeks_post_partum_bleeding_is_it_normal_need/	24	44	0	0.96	1472513038.0

what to do about the dead fish?	we use a sticker chart for potty training, and my almost 4 year old son decided he wanted to cash his stickers in to build a small fish tank. after so many stickers, he's put together a really great looking aquarium with 3 fish. last night, our power went out, the filter shorted, and we woke up to 3 fish belly up. my husband explained what happened, and that the fish died, we had a burial at sea for all 3 with a riveting rendition of row your boat from my teary eyed boy. he was sad, but seemed to understand his fish were gone. we're going to take him to the pet shop this weekend and pick out a new fish, and that seemed to perk him up. i dropped him off at preschool, and just received an email from the teacher. apparently she is upset because adam told his class his fish had died. the teacher said she was uncomfortable having to explain death to a bunch of three and four year olds. i felt we needed to be honest with my son that the fish weren't coming back. she said she would have told him the fish went on vacation. i don't feel my husband and i handled it inappropriately. death happens, and we felt like honesty about what that means was the best way to go. i like the teacher a lot, and so does my son. i'd like to respond and tell her i disagree. my husband thinks we should let it go and not make a big deal out of it. thoughts? edit i emailed the teacher to apologize for not giving her the heads up and putting her in a sticky situation. i wrote that we felt being honest with adam about the fish dying was the best approach for us. she responded that she understood, that adam had a good day and to remember the orange juice for the class breakfast next week. we're all cool. thanks for the advice ladies!

5 yo bedwetting regression advice	we aren't strangers to bedwetting. we had a consistent bedwetting issue with our 7yo daughter until just recently. her younger brother seemed like he had it down. he would wake one of us up to take him to the bathroom every night. but lately, since he turned 5 last december he has completely regressed... peeing the bed every single night. and not just little accidents, full on emptying of his bladder. i'm a little exasperated because we have tried everything to help. with our daughter it just took a really long time, but she never had a regression, she just didn't really know how to wake herself up before she peed. i know our son can wake up because he used to consistently. we have tried restricting liquids, having him pee before and after bedtime stories, making no big deal out of it, offering rewards for waking up to pee, etc. he just doesn't wake up or care to try. i know he does it in the middle of the night because he always pees as soon as he wakes up in the morning. i debated giving him big kid nighttime cloth diapers but it would have totally made things worse because he likes playing with all the babies things. he isn't a kid who gets upset at being called a baby. he nagged me for his own binky for months once he saw the baby's, he always tries to use the infant spoons instead of his own, plays with all the baby tummy time mats, etc. so the idea to give him diapers to save the sheets and encourage waking up is out. so i don't know what to do because it's not his fault he isn't waking up. i hope some of you have some answers or advice or just empathy because you've gone through it too!

pregnant again and struggling with resenting the baby. i really need help.	i'm not sure if this is the right place, but i'm really struggling and i need help. i have an almost 9 month old daughter. i am 13 weeks pregnant. i love my daughter more than i thought possible. she's my little mini-me and i want to do the absolute best for her. this pregnancy wasn't planned. i wasn't excited about it when i found out. i thought maybe that was just practical worry. i thought maybe after the ultrasound, i'd feel better. but i don't. it's been almost a month since the ultrasound. i am dreading this baby. i don't want it. i'm afraid to say that i think i hate it. i resent it. my milk is drying up, and my otherwise totally easy nursing relationship with my daughter, is becoming hugely difficult. i hate that he's already causing problems with my daughter. i'm terrified that she's just going to be cast aside when he's born because i'll have to spend so much time caring for him. i always wanted two kids, but i'm just not excited about this one. i keep hoping for a miscarriage. i feel evil for thinking that. i was never supposed to be able to even have kids, and the fact that we got so lucky and were able to conceive two is nothing short of a miracle. to wish it away is horribly ungrateful. i don't want to resent this kid. i don't want to feel this way. everyone else is so excited. my husband is so ridiculously proud. but i'm just not happy. i don't want this thing to steal me away from my daughter. i don't want to think about my child as this thing. but i just don't know what to do. i'm so scared.

other parent constantly playing with phone. i don't know what to do.	i have a 1-year-old daughter who is my universe. i work part-time friday nights - sunday, and i have the week off with my daughter. my boyfriend works 'til ~5 every night except saturdays and sundays. i cook dinner every night, he does dishes, we take turns giving her a bath. when we spend time together he always just... gets on his phone. nothing important--not even texting or getting on facebook , just... reading articles. stuff. when it's all 3 of us spending time together in the evening, which isn't much time, most of the time he's on his phone. he bounces between being very attentive and being glued to the screen.. a lot of the time while i'm making dinner she gets upset because i'm on the other side of the baby gate and i have to ask him to play with her. he's just always pulling it out. he'll play with her, he's a great dad, but he just... always pulls out his phone and scrolls around. i guess i never had a smartphone so i don't understand the addiction. and my parents didn't either, so i was never raised with it. i have no perspective, here. is this just life now? is this the way life is for most people? is this unhealthy for my daughter, or is this juts something she'll have to get used to--people glued to their technology? i guess i'm getting a little resentful and it's probably unfounded--he pays the house's rent/bills, i stay home with our daughter and pay my own bills/loans/etc with what i get from the weekend. he is taking on a larger responsibility in the workforce than i am because he's paying rent and bills and most of the groceries, etc. i understand when he gets home he wants time to himself. but as soon as little girl goes to sleep, he gets hours to play wow! every other night or so he wants to watch something with me, but most of the time i let him have his evenings to himself... which is plenty of free time to read articles or play on his phone or whatever, right? am i being selfish by thinking he should be able to hold off until she goes to bed? is it selfish, considering he, comparitavely, does more work? i tried to have a come-to-jesus meeting with him this evening and he kind of blew it off and didn't respond. he said ok, fine. i won't do it anymore. i'm not bored or anything. it's just driving me nuts, sometimes she tries to get his attention and he is just too busy reading stuff on his phone, and any time i tell him she's trying to play with you or she brought you a book i think he's perceiving it as me nagging him, so nothing changes and he doesn't see any problem with it he just lags. behind. because of it. if one of us is giving her a bath, the other one gets the towel ready, a onesie, a diaper, and her toothbrush. most every night i bathe her he's sitting on the couch on his phone and hasn't done anything it's nothing big, it's just little stuff, and i don't know when she's going to take notice. or if she even is. is she gonna always feel like daddy's playing with his phone? or am i projecting? she's with me like 90% of the time except on weekends during the day... she gets phone-free parent time most of the time. is this not a big deal, then? i mean i get that it can get dull for some people, she's 1 year old and hasn't figured a lot of stuff out yet.. i love playing with her--i'm constantly playing with her, interacting with her, paying attention when she plays with toys... will some contrast be healthy? like is this a good thing, having time without a parent giving undivided attention? will this maybe encourage her to play by herself more? is there a problem with it? is it just me? i don't know if i'm overreacting or what. like i said i don't have a smartphone and don't want one, so i guess i have limited perspective on what this all means in the big picture of her growing up from here on out--she was born in 2016, everyone has smart phones, and it's only going to get weirder. i dunno. this is half a rant, half seeking help and perspective. thanks for listening.	catfoodforever	/r/Mommit/comments/51ok1f/other_parent_constantly_playing_with_phone_i_dont/	26	37	0	0.87	1473294634.0
dadditor needs help with wife's nursing woes	hello again, mommit! 2 months ago my wife gave birth to an absolutely awesome little boy, our third child and 2nd son. he is just... awesome! anyway, about 2 weeks ago she was in for her 6-week checkup and was prescribed jolivette birth control which was part of our plan. i'm not sure if it's coincidence but since then she's had trouble producing a steady supply of breastmilk for our lil guy. this has been really hard for her because she wanted to really go all-in since this is our last baby and since she doesn't have to work she can really dedicate herself to it. not to mention money saved on formula! she keeps her fluids up and eats regular meals with a variety of foods. we also got some packets of this horrible smelling stuff that's supposed to increase milk supply. i don't think it's working. i was hoping the excellent ladies of mommit might have some tips or advise for her..	ebackhus	/r/Mommit/comments/51r3lk/dadditor_needs_help_with_wifes_nursing_woes/	62	22	0	0.87	1473338586.0
playground etiquette advice for outgoing 1 y/o with socially awkward parents?	husband and i are not social butterflies, but little man is. this kid will just go up to any other random kid and give hugs and generally socialize, zero shyness. our yard isn't great for playing so we go to parks and playgrounds regularly. the thing is we have no idea what's appropriate to let him do around other kids we don't know. i mean, should i let him walk right up to other kids and just start playing? is that weird? he's only 1 so he doesn't understand personal space and boundaries, he'll go up and literally hug kids and examine their shoes, try to touch their shirts if they're colorful, or whatever. i don't let him run up to a group of 6 year olds where he might get trampled, i'm talking preschool age kids. what about when a parent is playing with their 1-3 year old and my son wants to go play too? should i try to keep him by me or let him go up and say hi? it doesn't bother me when kids come over to us when we play, i like when that happens because it makes my son happy. but i'm always afraid someone will get mad if he just barges in on their good time. i love that he's social, i want to encourage him to be confident and not be afraid to make new friends. i just don't want to seem like i'm letting him be a nuisance and have some parent get nasty with me. any advice so we don't end up being the playground weirdos lol?	babymamajama	/r/Mommit/comments/51t9n9/playground_etiquette_advice_for_outgoing_1_yo/	15	63	0	0.96	1473364680.0
how could someone just leave their newborn?	today was kind of an upsetting day. found out that my uncles ex wife but anyway her daughter was pregnant and due around the same time as me. which would have been sometime in july. well, i found out that she had her baby, the baby was addicted to meth or heroin. the mom abandoned her baby at the hospital and disappeared. how can you choose drugs over your own child, that you carried for 9 months? if i had known i would have offered to take the baby. but to just up and leave your child because getting high is more important, baffles me.	wikedtruth	/r/Mommit/comments/51zzrf/how_could_someone_just_leave_their_newborn/	24	12	0	0.68	1473458971.0
how should we keep kids entertained at a wedding?	not sure if i'm posting to the right subreddit. planning a wedding and about 7 of our guests will range from the ages of 3-14. we don't want to do a kids table even if we hire someone to watch them . so we thought, maybe do like a nice personalized goody bag for each kid to keep some of them from dying of boredom? we're thinking of filling them up with mini lego kits, activity book with crayons, and snacks. anyone have better ideas or been to a wedding with your kids where they catered to them a little? tips? i'll take anything! ps i found packaged cotton candy online and it's labeled as unicorn farts ...i'm definitely giving those out to the kids...thought i'd share cause it was a neat find on amazon . update wow!!! thanks for the awesome suggestions guys! funny how i'm a little more excited to put all these things together for them than putting together our centerpieces, hah! btw the reception is indoors .

struggling w/ my teen daughter	hi parents, i have a 13 year old daughter who is smart and so talented, but it's been a circus with her the last few months.... she seems so down lately. i don't know if it is just around me, but every time we are together, she doesn't talk or just tries to avoid me. when we do communicate, we are in a yelling match.... and though i know as her mother i should not yell, it is so hard. i am stressed day in and day out with her inconsiderate behavior, her mean attitude, and just how much she takes me for granted as i am basically raising her on my own. i know she is just a kid, but i just need some advice.... is this a teenage girl thing? she blows up on me in a split second and says mean things to me.... i feel like she hates and resents me. i have had problems yelling and losing my temper in the past, but i am genuinely trying to change that for her sake but she is constantly pushing me. mornings are so hard because i take her to school before work and she just takes her time when i've told her she is going to make the both of us late. seems like talking to her nicely never works... but when i do yell, she starts saying horrible things to me. she struggles with her weight and has started skipping meals and i've tried explaining that she is an active teen who needs the energy, etc... i have noticed mornings are hard too because she tries on clothes for the day and hates how she looks so she takes it out on me and gives me attitude and grief.... how do i handle all of this? i am a mess just trying to find some sort of support to help me help her. this is by far the hardest stage in her life and i do not know what to do. please help..........	momofteen12	/r/Mommit/comments/52safr/struggling_w_my_teen_daughter/	10	30	0	0.92	1473881839.0

how do i parent my 6 month old?	eta - thank you for all the responses! this is my first post on this sub-reddit and i knew i came to the right place. you all are so encouraging and supportive. thank you thank you thank you. this is very long, i know. but i really need some advice and wanted to be as detailed as possible, so please if you have time can you read and give some advice? i feel like such a failure of a mother. i have spent my whole life knowing i wanted to be a mother. i grew up babysitting for all the neighbourhood kids. i nannied for a 2 year old at one point. i am a teacher . i have always loved spending time with my nephews . i even took care of one of my nephews one day a week from the age of 6 months - 1.5 years. so i guess i expected that moming would be no problem for me. well here i am, 6 months in, and feeling like i am just not cut out for this. my babe has been a tough one from the get-go. he was never a good sleeper and he has always been on the fussy end of the spectrum. from 0-3 months he slept so much during the day that it wasn't too hard to entertain him when he was awake, but he did require me to constantly bounce him, walk around with him, etc when he was awake. i could not put him down on/in anything, and i also couldn't just sit down and hold him. he has never been a cuddly baby, and never simply wanted to be held or snuggled or rocked. no, he had to be held face out, and walked around the house and bounced. but as i said, the amount of wake time was minimal so i was only ever doing this for an hour at a time here and there throughout the day. i also chalked it up to being in the fourth trimester and told myself that things would get better. cut to now he is 6 months old and things are not better! his wake time between naps is about 2 hours and i am finding it so hard to parent him during these times. he is only ever happy if i take him for a walk, or take a bath with him. when i do either of those two things he is totally chill/happy/content. here is what a typical 2 hour wake time looks like for us lay him down on our big foam mat, on his back, and play with him. he will roll around a bit, and play a bit, but he will begin to fuss after 5-10 mins and then slowly escalate to full on crying. then i try to pull him into my lap. he squirms and thrusts his hips and continues to cry. i try singing to him again. he still cries. i sit him up and give him a toy. he still cries. i give him a teether. he bites it once and then cries more. i try giving him a snack. he cries. eventually i take him outside and we go for a walk . it doesn't matter what activity i start with, it always starts out okay for a few mins and then shortly after he is crying. if i am proactive i might be able to move him from one activity to another before he melts down, but this would literally involve me doing something new with him every five minutes, which is exhausting. i am at a complete loss as to what to do. i wind up in tears at the end of every day because i am so exhausted. today i went on five different walks with him and we spent 40 mins in the bath together. but this just doesn't seem sustainable to me. plus i live in canada and winter is coming. i don't recall any of my nephews being like this. i also can't hear anybody tell me 'it's just a phase one more time, because he has never been chill! so i guess my questions are....is this normal behaviour for a 6 month old? how should i be responding? i know you can't spoil a newborn by picking them up/responding to their cries, but at what point does that stop being true? am i doing something wrong? i don't understand why my baby seems to be so unhappy so often. i love him to pieces but i am also so resentful that i can't enjoy this stage of my child's life because it is so hard. when i meet up with friends or my sisters, and their babies, i get so jealous that they seem to just play on the floor contentedly, while i am doing everything in my power to distract mine and keep him from crying. please help!!!	cerealaddict30	/r/Mommit/comments/52u8e6/how_do_i_parent_my_6_month_old/	76	33	0	0.95	1473908080.0

double and triple check who watches your kids 	we have had the worst luck with finding good care for our kids. it's been a nightmare to say the least. we have gone through 4 or 5 nannies now? it's been things like being allergic to our dogs, getting a migraine from my toddler's happy screeches, and one who was crazy and called my 3 yro names bc he was being 3. today the nanny we had the last week and a half was fired because she lied to us amongst other small red flags and issues. she violated the contract numerous times. she cause my husband to miss work one day and me be super late another and kinda late today. the list goes on. so we gave her a termination letter today with half of the rate because she barely, if at all, did half the job. we had every right to not pay her at all but because we are good people, we paid her for what she did. in the letter it even said if she accepts the money than she is accepting that this is all she will get from us and that she has no recourse to get more. that the relationship is done. the letter also explained why she was being terminated. she took the money and our house key and left the letter. my husband has it all recorded. she then sent me a barrage of harassing messages. i kept requesting the key back and she kept sending me nasty messages. she eventually called the cops on us and they told her they could do nothing. she could take it to small claims but that's it . they talked to us and told us if she doesn't return or key we can report it as stolen property and she'll have a warrant for arrest. it also turns out that she told the sheriff that she's 17 and she told us she's 18. so i have no idea what her real age is. hopefully the sheriff will figure it out. i had googled her, checked her references, etc. i didn't pay for a background check which i will do from now on. thankfully my kids are ok. i did my due diligence and i still got screwed over. i had found her through a group on fb bc i was desperate. now i'm exhausted and angry. i feel like the worst parent ever.

how often do you get pictures done of your kids/ family? feeling like a slacker-mom	full disclosure, because i have never been in reddit before, i do have a business but i'm not here to market it. i don't have a wide circle of mom friends locally that i can ask this sort of question, i have only been a mom for two years, and my husband suggested i check out reddit. how often do you realistically want to get pictures of your kids? i see a lot of mini sessions springing up all year around valentine's day, easter, mother's day, first day of school, halloween, and christmas. what is actually realistic? are all these sessions that kind of pinterest mom kinds of pressure? my personal inclination is to say like maybe 2 per year, but i want to provide what people are interested in. my inclination toward maybe 2 per year makes me concerned about over-doing sessions if i plan for more. i don't want people to feel like i expect them to book sessions every two months all year round and that's how i would feel. i would rather people invest in the pictures they really want to have and for me personally, that has never been mini-sessions. if you can't tell, i am a horrible sales person. i don't like to tell people they need to spend money on things that i don't truly believe they need to have. quality pictures are always worth the investment, but i think it is worth investing in the things that are most important to you, and for me that is birthdays, family time and traditions, big events, notsomuch the themed shoots. discuss, please. i am truly trying to understand how to better conduct business that meets client needs and expectations, not just mine. your pictures are about you, not me. and if i want to call myself a professional i feel it is my responsibility to use my vision and skills to make my client's expectations come to reality. not to tell people what they want, be happy with my work, and them not get what they want. i don't want to just do what everyone else is doing because it is what is the norm but i can't just only offer the things i like because my taste is my own. if this post isn't allowed, apologies in advance. reading the rules it didn't seem like it isn't allowed.

flying from san francisco to the east coast with a 1 year old and a 3 year old. advice?	i'm flying home to the east coast for two weeks in december. we leave sfo at 6am, and have ~4 hour flight to dallas, where our layover is an hour. then we have a ~3 hour flight to our destination in the southeast, arriving around 4pm est. on our way home, we leave at 7 20pm have a ~2 hour flight to washington, dc and then a ~5.5 hour flight home to sfo, arriving at 1 30am pst. my boys are very little, and i'll be the only one flying with them. my oldest will be 3, and he's very rambunctious. my youngest is still an infant and nursing, so that's at least easier. my 3 year old has his own seat, and i will be carrying the youngest on my lap. i'm normally a very capable person, so i'm trying to have some faith in myself, but i'm really anxious about flying with small child by myself. obviously, i will be bringing things to entertain both of them, but in regards to what specifically i could use some suggestions. i don't want to bring anything with small objects- no crayons, certainly no markers or anything similar that could made a mess with. i'll bring our tablet and headphone for the 3 year old with some shows and videos. what safety precautions should i take when flying with an older toddler? honestly i kind of want to strap a gps cuff to his arm, haha i think i'm just looking for reassurance here. i'm super nervous about it, despite not being a nervous person in general. --- edit any videos or shows you can recommend that might help a 3 year old understand traveling on a plane and airports? he's flown three times before in his life, but all before he was a year old, so he doesn't remember it.	slidewithme	/r/Mommit/comments/55fmc0/flying_from_san_francisco_to_the_east_coast_with/	30	26	0	0.89	1475362114.0
advice on wooden train sets, please	i want to start a young relative on a train set. wooden is the parents' preference, and mine as well. he doesn't know from thomas the train, so there's no need to accommodate that aspect. what i'm looking for is the best quality and play value among brands in general, and then the best type of set to start out. i've googled this and studied up on amazon reviews, but can't get a good consensus. i'm also confused as to which pieces would make for the most fun for a beginner. i lean toward a figure 8 set, but would like some expansion pieces or another compatible set that would make it more interesting. thanks. update i found and purchased a used thomas figure 8 set at a consignment sale. i was congratulating myself, till i happened upon an article about a 2007 thomas recall. 22 items from the wooden train line were recalled, most of them painted red. you can see the full list here list of recalls 2007 i am now planning to stick to new items, and preferably the brio line. better to add slowly than to get a good deal on something that was recalled.	lucillep	/r/Mommit/comments/55jsbd/advice_on_wooden_train_sets_please/	27	20	0	0.91	1475436396.0

hi moms, godfather here needing some advice about tablets	i'm godfather to my cousin's 2 year old . they've been relying pretty heavily on tablets and tv due to a very busy schedule. the 6 year old is, at least, on a very intensive ice skating schedule when she's not in kindergarten, and the 2 year old gets bored with the tablet pretty easily. anyway, i know using tablets with kids isn't a good option overall, but they can't make the time commitment to wean them off yet, and not being a parent, i can only make suggestions but should follow their lead. so i'm asking around if any of you know of any apps that are educational games, particularly for language or math . they currently have amazon fires, but if the app selection is that much of a bust, i'd be willing to buy them another brand of tablet that has better options. i do my best to read with the 6 year old when i'm around, but i'm not always around, and if they're going to be glued to tablets, at least it'd be something productive.		/r/Mommit/comments/55thud/hi_moms_godfather_here_needing_some_advice_about/	17	24	0	0.92	1475588087.0
friend is having a baby soon, not sure what to get.	long story short my friend has had a rough couple years. her home was destroyed in a flood not long ago and lost everything. she was supposed to get married soon but had complications with her birth control and ended up getting pregnant. it wasn't expected but they are happy nonetheless and have postponed the wedding. unfortunately, she also has a heart condition and due to the nature of the medication she is on she has had to go off it and be put on bed rest for the duration of the pregnancy, so she is missing a lot of work. her fiance has just started a new business and while it's going well, any new small business takes a whole lot of work to get going. her baby shower is coming up soon and i want to get her something that will be really useful, at least more useful than a onesie and pack of diapers. the problem is, being a single mom and college student i don't have a lot to work with. also, it's been 10 years since my little one was actually a little one so i don't remember particular items that i had/wished i had that i thought i couldn't live without. what do you guys think? what are some small items that you have found the most useful? tl;dr i love my friend to pieces, she's been through a couple rough patches, want to find a couple small but useful gifts to help with new baby to show her how much i appreciate her.	-____-_-_-_--_____--	/r/Mommit/comments/567wbp/friend_is_having_a_baby_soon_not_sure_what_to_get/	11	2	0	0.76	1475789747.0

moms with depression how do you cope?	my husband and i are 30 with a 21 month old and one on the way due in april. for a while now i've been struggling with depression, i'm in therapy although i don't really feel it's helping. my husband doesn't really understand the scope of how serious it's getting, partially because i don't know how to share. our child is amazing. sweetest little being, and while sometimes challenging, they both are pretty much the only thing other than my parents who bring me joy. i'm having a really difficult time coping, trying to get through the day and i'm afraid it's negatively affecting my parenting. i feel distracted and foggy, no self-esteem and rarely have the energy to clean or cook. i've become extremely short tempered and just feel generally at my wits end. i'm just not sure how to cope, or even move forward.

toddler yeast infection? advice needed.	i have a 20-month-old girl who is super active and mostly happy. yesterday and today i noticed that she has a lot of redness and some white discharge, and when i wiped her, she started crying so it obviously hurts her. i'm a new mom , so i've never dealt with this before. making things worse is that today is thanksgiving in canada, so the only doctor i'd be able to take her to would be at the emergency department. she doesn't have a fever, but she does also have a croup-like cough, which is undoubtedly unrelated to the other issue. fellow parents, do i take her to emerg? is it okay to wait until i can take her to a clinic tomorrow? is there a way i can help her here at home until she sees a doc?

please help! daycare and food for my baby never enough breast milk	today we started daycare and i'm already regretting it. my partner and i followed the enrollment packet suggestions for clothes, diapers, and food but the infant teacher said that what we provided was not enough. she asked for 3 full days of clothes and diapers, which is fine, but i think i will need to buy some more tonight. we use cloth diapers so i might even buy some extras. what has me fretting is food. i sent along two bottles dry soy formula, three smallish bags of breast milk and a packet of strawberry banana pure. my milk supply has been very low even though i am guzzling mothers milk tea and stuffing my face with cookies and energy bites made of flax seed and brewers yeast. my baby drank all the breast milk before noon and the teacher said they only give mixed formula - or in other words, i can't send dry formula and ask them to add water and shake. i have to mix it. but the formula we use says on package it is only good for one hour after mixed. my commute to work and daycare is an hour exactly so i can't bring formula without risking it going bad. i just don't know what to do! the process of dropping baby off and getting her settled eliminates the morning time i had for pumping and i don't have time on my lunch break to feed her when i visit and then pump. i'm already worried that when i pump in the evening i will be sitting there for hours and get little dribbles, which is apparently my new normal. how can i get my supply back up to the 200 ml range instead of the pitiful 90 ml i pump now? edit thank you all very much for your insights - i appreciate you taking the time. i took the day off of work to try to get ahead on pumping. i talked to a lactation consultant and a doula. there's a lot of good advice here for keeping formula so thank you very much!

how to prepare velcro toddler for new baby?	i'm due in less than 4 months and already stressing over how my velcro 19 month old will adjust. when baby sis is born he'll be 23 months. we have an incredible bond, i'm a stay at home mom and while he has a very involved grandma who comes over a few days a week he is very much a mamas baby. he loves to cuddle, be held, hold my hand at the park, we're always playing or he's following me around the house or trying to sit on my lap.. he does ok with independent play though it depends on his mood.though he seems jealous if we're cuddling and dad tries to join or if i hug dad a little too long. i know this is going to rock his world and i'm open to any and all resources/tips/books/advice on how to make this a smooth transition for him. we talk about baby sometimes and he gives my belly a few oats and a kiss but he really has no idea what's going on. i watch a friends 2 year old one morning a week and he's great sharing his toys though the 2 year old never really sits on my lap or wants to be held. dad will be able to take about 4 weeks leave, grandma will be available pretty often though i'm really opposed to daycare or preschool right now. help??

how bad is tv for a one-year-old, really?	my son watches a good amount of tv. yes, it is 90% the baby channel but it is still tv. now he is really paying attention to what is going on and gets a little grumpy when we change the channel. but...here is the problem. my husband and i are so lucky to live with his parents while we save for a house and i finish school. we are also blessed to have them so active in their only grandchild's life. i honestly love seeing our son spend time with his grandparents and it is a tremendous help to have 24/7 babysitters. however, when they watch baby he is in the living room in a gated playpen with cartoons on for about 3 to 5 hours while i am away. the playpen is another issue. the tv used to be background noise to baby but now he really pays attention. grandma will count with him and engage with him what is going on on the shows but grandpa not so much. my dilemma is i have a problem telling them how to watch our son and putting restrictions because they are doing us such a huge favor. when i come home, i will take him out of the play pen and into a larger gated area so he can play with me without the tv. how bad is this for our son? i am afraid of his dependency on the tv. my husband and i did watch a ton of tv and we turned out okay but doesn't everyone say that. i'm more concerned about these little temper episodes when we change the channel or talk during a cartoon. in a perfect world, we would be in our own child-friendly house but it just isn't time yet and i really do love having the grandparents so close.

looking for advice on how to help my daughter	i'm not sure if there is a more appropriate sub or not, but i thought i'd start here. if there is, please let me know. i'm looking for advice. but let me give you some background first. my first daughter was born 3 weeks early and weighed only 5lbs 4oz. despite her size, she was absolutely normal. near perfect apgar's, no oxygen needed... she had colic for her first four months. rolled over, sat up, crawled and walked all in a normal time frame. however, she was significantly delayed in her speech. by 18 months she still had not uttered a single word so we began speech therapy at that time. she is close to a normal vocabulary now but still needs to go to speech to help with pronunciation. which brings us to now. she is 6 years old and in first grade. she knows her letters and the sounds that almost all of them make but she cannot string any of them together to read a word. it's almost like it hasn't clicked in her head how it works. there are sight words that they need to learn and she is nowhere where she needs to be. she should know 2 or 3 times more by now. she is so far behind than her classmates. her teacher has had me come in to talk about how she's doing twice already. i've brought up the idea of maybe having her redo kindergarten but she said that they don't like doing that. i've been working with her everyday. on her sight words, on her writing, on her reading, on her math... she's struggling in every subject. she couldn't even count to 10 until this past summer. i don't know how to help her. she gets frustrated and wants to quit. she can't sit still in her chair and focus. she's going to keep falling farther and farther behind. i need advice on how to help her from home. or some encouraging words. something. thanks for reading.

potty training son with asd, where to start	my son just turned two a week ago, and he was also diagnosed with asd. he isn't talking yet, but is a good non verbal communicator. his motor skills tested normal, but his speech and social skill are what they are concerned with. he has started showing signs that he might be ready for potty training, but since he can't talk i'm not sure how to tell if he's ready. he keeps pulling at his diaper, opening them, and reaching into them after he's pooped and becomes uncomfortable. which is leading to gross problems, so i think maybe it's time to start. i'm worried about starting too soon, but diapers are leading to problems. please help.	ally_quake	/r/Mommit/comments/58pacj/potty_training_son_with_asd_where_to_start/	2	2	0	0.76	1477080088.0

toddler boy mom looking for advice.	this is cross posted from the /r/twoxchromsomes subreddit, following the advice from a commenter on my original post. i hope this is okay to say here. i have an issue that has bothered me for a couple of years, but i don't feel comfortable talking to the people in my life about it, so i thought internet strangers would be perfect. i am married and have a toddler boy under the age of 3. he's really starting to get interested in his body and my body and my husband's body, and is exploring himself and all that when we change him or when he's in the bath. i know that's normal and expected and i'm trying to be supportive and just let him do his thing. i'm sure this is really weird, but i'm afraid i'm going to somehow do something inappropriate to him, sexually. not like an i'm afraid because i want to , it's not like that at all! it's more of an i'm afraid because i have no idea what the hell i'm doing trying to raise a boy. i was the youngest child and only had sisters, so no young boy experience. i did experience sexual abuse in my childhood. i don't want my son to grow up and feel like i did something inappropriate. i am really quick when i change him or bathe him when it's time to clean his business, but i'm extremely uncomfortable unless we're both dressed. i've told my husband this and he says that i need to relax, he knows my intentions aren't sexual at all, and he's never seen me do anything that could be viewed or taken inappropriately. being naked and my own sexual identity make me extremely uncomfortable also, and i don't want to pass that on to him! i think this is something that's all in my head, and i'm not going to ruin him for life, but it's something i worry about every single day. have any other moms of boys experienced this? what did you do to make these feelings go away? i do go to therapy, but this hasn't changed in all the time i've been going. please help. if you made it this far, thanks for listening. 	glitterybugs	/r/Mommit/comments/59fp1z/toddler_boy_mom_looking_for_advice/	16	14	0	0.9	1477456295.0
what is it like to be a mother?	hi ladies, i've been lurking this sub and have enjoyed reading your posts and advice. you all seem to be a great group of moms. i hope this question is ok to ask here, i asked a similar question to parenting and got shut down. to be frank i'm of the age where it is time to have kids if it is going to happen. i'm married, financially stable, and probably as ready as one can be, as if one can be ready to have a child. what i'm wondering is this what is it truly like to be a parent? more often than not, i read/hear the negative aspects. i value this information as i want to appropriately set my expectations before taking the plunge to parenthood. however, i want to hear your truthful experiences. what did you like? not like? is it worth it? for me, i like older children. babies and toddlers are cute but overwhelm me. obviously you work up to having a toddler, but sheesh! they are a handful! i love the idea of having a family of my own, but i worry i am not cut out for it. i'm not an organized person and i am deeply introverted. i worry i won't be good at it. i worry i will actually hate it and regret it. but! i'm equally concerned i will hate not being a parent. there are parts that seem lovely. i'm just wondering if the bad parts outweigh the good. can you offer some advice for me? i am firmly on the fence about it but i have to make a decision soon. so tell me what is it truly like to be a parent?

question for breastfeeding moms who became pregnant...	i'm still breastfeeding my 10 month old, and i think i might be pregnant again. some background, when i became pregnant with my son my boobs let me know way before i could take a pee test. though i've been using birth control, i did have to be on antibiotics at the beginning of my cycle this time. dh did use condoms as back up, but the girls have been aching so badly since yesterday. no signs of it being mastitis. i still have about 5 days before a test could be reliable. so i was wondering if any of you other breastfeeding mamas became pregnant and had early signs? if so what were they? this is more out of curiosity than anything. thanks.

my toddler gets over excited when her dad gets home. is there anyway i can help her learn to calm down?	ok so, yes it's super cute, she squeals daddy!!!!! the moment she hears the knob turn and runs to the door screaming and jumping to get in his arms. but, we live with a shared wall and are getting a puppy soon. we don't want the pupper to pick up a bad habit of getting over excited with the kids when someone walks in the door. her older sister used to do the same and we do already got her to start modeling good behavior. but the toddler is kinda spunky and really misses her dad when he is gone. when he comes in we to greet him with calm voices and low energy, but it's not getting through to the youngest. any advice, my next step is to tell her a few min. ahead of time he is coming home, and greet him outside. maybe that way i can let them explode away from the puppy.

mil always wanting xmas at her house.. how do i change our tradition?	ok so we're a new family.. my son is 3 and my daughter is 18 months. we've been going to mil house for christmas and every year she asks me to give her an idea list of toys for the kids. no problem! she wants to buy and we're kind of poor so it's a win-win! except she never buys anything off of my list. she buys obnoxious, age inappropriate toys. plastic crap. i'm stay home with the kids and i've put a lot of thought into my lists each time... and each time i have to hold back my disappointment and anger with her inconsideration! we've also set up a 529 savings plan for our kids and they haven't deposited one penny! she always opts for useless toys instead of their future. i feel like she just looks and me and my husband as children as well. she gets to feed her shopping addiction, get all the credit for santa coming to her house, and gets to snub me and make me powerless. i'll admit i'm way to passive and nice and i don't want to cause any negative feelings towards the holidays or myself.. am i just ungrateful? should i just shrug it off? i'm kind of dreading this christmas. and how do i address the college savings plan?		/r/Mommit/comments/5clvqt/mil_always_wanting_xmas_at_her_house_how_do_i/	63	59	0	0.87	1478977663.0
i need help with a diaper demon!	my unusually happy, chill, unicorn child has started freaking the hell out at every diaper change and we are ready to lose our minds! he is just shy of 15 months. the small tantrums have started but he is redirected so easily. no diaper rash issues and the only people that change his diaper are me and my husband. but starting a few days ago my son rolls,kicks,fights and screams himself into a lather at every diaper change. at first a small toy or item would distract him and help but that no longer works. anyone else deal with this?

needed advice/validation/resources for a new mom.	hi, mommit. ianam, but i have a friend who just gave birth to her first child three weeks ago. my friend bam is a wonderful person and a loving mother and she could really use some support right now. bam is having some issues with her partner, who has been critical about how much she holds the baby. he believes the infant cries for attention and has been discouraging bam from holding the baby every time he gets upset, despite that whole maternal instinct to comfort her newborn. he has concerns that the child will have issues down the line if he is coddled too much, but i was not under the impression that three week old infants can achieve that level of attention-seeking manipulation. bam's partner's family tends to echo his sentiments and she could really use some support. i realize many of you may, like me, have some legit wtf reactions to this, but i ask that you be gentle with bam's feelings and maybe not jump to extreme judgments about her partner right away. she wants to sit down, have a talk and approach his concerns in a supportive/non-threatening way. can you all recommend some literature that might be an easy read and a useful tool to someone who doesn't know much about babies? especially helpful would be something that specifically backs up the fact that bam isn't ruining the kid by holding him when he cries? also, are there any online forums in addition to mommit she might find helpful/comforting? what kind of things can she do to feel more supported in these most stressful of times? i am in constant awe of the moms of the world and all that you do and i wish to thank you in advance for contributing to this thread.	bagelsandkegels	/r/Mommit/comments/5d4zli/needed_advicevalidationresources_for_a_new_mom/	6	8	0	0.8	1479243219.0

my best friend of 22 years is having her first. i'm clueless and just want her to feel important on the big day.	hello, all as the title says, my best friend is having her first baby. he was not planned and she is understandably nervous. i have absolutely no experience with babies, and honestly i'm only interested in them because she's having one. so, safe to say, i'm way out of my element. her due date is coming up and she's expressed her anxiety about, well everything. all that being said, i want her to feel special and loved on a day where many feel overwhelmed. i know some moms feel like they were overlooked after going through a very trying experience . how can i make her feel special on that day? what was something you guys wish was done for you after becoming a mom for the first time? i love her tremendously, and of course i love her baby too, i just don't want her to feel neglected in any way.	mypenguinbruce11	/r/Mommit/comments/5f331b/my_best_friend_of_22_years_is_having_her_first_im/	8	4	0	0.71	1480213366.0
how do we explain santa to our toddler when we have no intention of making him a tradition?	neither my husband, nor myself are christian. several years ago, we decided to celebrate the solstice, rather than christmas. this has really only changed the date, given that the tree and lights and all that aren't from the christian tradition. anyhow, we also decided that we didn't want santa to be a thing. all of our siblings carry on santa traditions so we're not judging, it's just not something we want to do. previously, our daughter hasn't realized that she can ask santa for things for christmas, and we've enjoyed that since it leaves the focus on family, rather than toys. but people keep asking her what she wants from santa or if she's excited to see santa. what should we tell her so she's not disappointed when he doesn't make a stop at our house, but also so she won't ruin it for other kids?	sortaplainnonjane	/r/Mommit/comments/5f8ojz/how_do_we_explain_santa_to_our_toddler_when_we/	44	64	0	0.85	1480294097.0

don't want to spoil my daughter, would love advice for a small matter	my husband and i are finally feeling financially stable after years of struggling. this has affected my parenting style. opportunities are much more open to my children all of a sudden. i've made a few mistakes buying big ticket items/trips for my kids over the past year resulting in a bit of entitled behavior that we are actively trying to squelch. chores, no replacement devices for poor care or loss, screen time after schoolwork and chores, pay for your own apps or accessories, you want it you earn it . we now understand what an oopsie it was to hand them wants so abruptly. my daughter recently brought home a holiday schedule from school that has 10 days of themed dress up for christmas leading up to christmas break. we don't have much in the way of holiday clothes. on one hand i feel it's important to let my children participate and fit in to social activities. there is something to be said about feeling like you are a part of something. i didn't have those opportunities as a child and neither did my husband. i want to buy her some christmas sweaters, socks/tights, red and green apparel, and slippers but i don't want to send the wrong message. she just lost her tablet for three days in the couch and she drained the battery in my ipad playing games but didn't recharge it or put it away. she also just got straight a's, does all her homework and chores responsibly, is on the safety patrol at school, donated tons of toys, and saved her birthday money to buy christmas gifts for friends and family. what do?	lemizzmizz	/r/Mommit/comments/5h15nv/dont_want_to_spoil_my_daughter_would_love_advice/	16	18	0	0.88	1481131347.0
how do you handle sharing with a toddler?	i'm lost on this one and could use some advice. my son is 15 months and an only child. he goes to a play class several times a week plus other activities so he's around other kids frequently. he's just getting into taking things away from other kids and i'm not sure what the right way is to handle it. i try to let it slide unless it's clearly upsetting the other kid, then i'll step in and kinda guide his hands to give back the toy and say something like timmy is playing with the truck now, let's share and you can have a turn next. i realize that's too complicated for him to understand, but what else should i do? the other moms usually say oh they're too young to understand sharing, don't worry about it. but it feels wrong for me not to do something when he's taking a toy from a kid and making them cry! i thought that by at least letting him know that's not preferred behavior, something might click somewhere in his little toddler brain. maybe not really grasping the concept of sharing, but realizing that making someone sad is not a good thing to do. but i hear that statement about him being too young to understand so often that i feel like i'm doing it wrong. it's not a huge problem , he plays well for the most part, but i can't shake the feeling that not intervening at all will eventually lead to a bigger problem...so, what are more age appropriate ways to handle this?	babymamajama	/r/Mommit/comments/5h1hyx/how_do_you_handle_sharing_or_lack_of_with_a/	7	4	0	0.84	1481134713.0

my best friend's son is so mean to my son, but i can't discipline it because it could negatively affect my housing situation. what do i do?	my family live on an acre in the guest house of my best friend's property, while her family live in the main house. we have four boys, aged 10, 8, 6, and 5, and they usually get along really well, so living on this large plot of land has been great for them. recently, however, her oldest, 10, has started to be really brutally mean to my oldest, 8. this goes beyond simple name calling and bullying, as it has started to become 10 teasing for 8 having two dads and one mom and for other things outside of 8's control like his crooked teeth. i know that kids sometimes say things without realizing how hurtful they are, but even still... my concerns with the whole situation are two-fold. firstly, my best friend never assigns blame to 10 for anything. she always passes it off to the entire group or reassigns it either to 10's brother or one of my children. this is obviously a problem because it means that nothing is ever getting solved, merely passed around until it's forgotten. secondly, while my best friend's grandfather technically owns the land we live on, he only owns it in name as my rent is paid to her and she makes all the repairs. our relationship is great outside of the stress that our children are putting on it and i don't know how to fix it because the one time we've argued since i moved in, she threatened to have her grandfather kick us out. i would take an eviction in a heartbeat for my kids, but we really love it here and i don't want it to come to that for my friendship either. has anybody else navigated this recently? how do i proceed?		/r/Mommit/comments/5hqcgm/my_best_friends_son_is_so_mean_to_my_son_but_i/	20	53	0	0.96	1481467508.0

about 3 years ago i posted about my daughter when we found out she had a brain tumor, and again about a year later when she got past the worst of it. a month ago, my daughter died. i wanted to share her with you one last time.	i posted about my daughter when she was first diagnosed. it was the worst day of my life and every comment was so genuinely caring and sympathetic. i had the same result when i posted about her progress. most of you still remembered the original post and were glad to get the update so i decided to share this too. on october 30th my daughter was at home with a home health nurse and, though the details are still unclear, her tracheostomy tube came out and she stopped breathing. we weren't sure how much time she'd spent without oxygen because her nurse was hysterical and in shock but it's since been established that she was unconscious for about 15 minutes. she never woke up after they got her pulse back. by the time she was loaded in to the ambulance i knew it was too late. once they put her in the picu she started having seizures and they had to sedate her and paralyze her to stop the convulsions. she then developed a high fever. all of that was a result of the brain damage she had suffered. on tuesday morning, november 1st, she got an mri and it showed complete brain death. we decided there was no reason to prolong any suffering she may have had and requested an organ recovery team come and do a final brain death evaluation. because her brain tumor was malignant she wasn't able to donate all her organs but she could donate her tissue and eyes. we took her off the ventilator at 2 30 am on november 2nd and time of death was pronounced at 2 37. my daughter was the most amazing person i will ever know. i know everyone says that about their children but rachel truly was unique and special. she touched every single person she met. when she was first diagnosed we lived in the hospital for 4 months. it usually took us about 20 minutes to walk from her room to the cafeteria because every other person we passed knew her and had to stop for a hug and a sticker, which she gave out to everyone she met. she shared everything. when doctors came in for rounds she would give one of her toys to each one and they would all leave them in a pile on their way out the door only to do it again the next day and the day after that and so on. she crowned hugh laurie as king of bacchus for mardi gras , met nick saban and a couple of the saints players. she had a whole group of marines blowing bubbles with her, got a live show from the 610 stompers and became the poster child for take 5 oil change's fundraiser for children's hospital of new orleans. my daughter only lived 5 short years and she had over 200 people at her funeral. she changed my life and i will never be whole again. rachel was my world and my world has come crashing down. i will try to pick up the pieces and live a life she would be proud of but i will never be the same. i'm a better, stronger person because of her and i will never forget that i am because she made me that way. i'm adding a bunch of pictures of her in the comments and i have a request. tell your kids, husbands, wives, parents, siblings, and friends about rachel. tell them how she beat impossible odds because of her strength and courage and, even though she went through hell with surgeries and chemo and scans and hospital stays, she always had a smile on her face and always wanted to put smiles on everyone else's face too . use my daughters story to motivate you and to see the upside in everything. any time you think something is more than you can handle remember what rachel got through and use her strength like i did. even though you never met her, she can help you like she helped everyone that knew her. all she ever wanted to do was make people happy. let her make you and your loved ones happy in some small way by sharing her story. thank you for how supportive you've all been in the past few years. i will never forget it.		/r/Mommit/comments/5i9c2k/about_3_years_ago_i_posted_about_my_daughter_when/	49	301	0	0.97	1481701009.0

need advice about fear of childbirth	hi! i'm not sure if this is the right place for this but, i am looking to get advice on how to get over my fear of childbirth. a little background i am twenty three and my husband of about three years is twenty two. when i was younger, when me and my husband were only dating, i didn't want kids. it seems like i really started wanting children around the middle of last year. i think about having our first child all the time now, but i am still terrified to be pregnant. i have known a handful of women my age that have already had their first or a couple children and it seems like they did pretty well through their pregnancy and during childbirth. i cannot help but think they must be stronger than me or have a higher pain tolerance. i have gotten my husband to agree that we can start trying to expand our family after we get into a house and i am excited but scared at the same time. i really just want to know why i shouldn't be afraid of childbirth and maybe some experiences from others. if this is the wrong place to post this i apologize and thank you in advance for the advice.	inspiredstone	/r/Mommit/comments/5jml8q/need_advice_about_fear_of_childbirth/	31	22	0	0.84	1482356318.0

anyone have advice for living with parents?	okay so i'll keep my background brief, i am a single mom to a 3 yo boy. currently i am in school full time with a very demanding schedule. i am set to graduate next may. i have lived with my parents since i had my son. and i love them dearly and appreciate everything they've done and do for me and my son, it's getting unbearable. in my opinion i feel like believes my son is their do over child . they constantly go against what i say in terms of discipline, even berating me infront of my child. they undermine me constantly and i really feel like my sons sees this. when i voice my concerns it's i'm not being appreciative or i'm too hard on him. i'm a first time mom, i know i'm gonna make mistakes, but i feel like i'm constantly being judged by my family in how i parent. honestly at this point, i feel like a terrible mom. i have no confidence in myself as far as parenting. and my son does not listen to me unless i threaten multiple times with toy removal or time out. even then he is throwing massive tantrums, which i know is par for the course for 3 year olds, but i honestly get anxiety taking him anywhere by myself because of this. i know that i shouldn't rely on people for confidence in myself but it is on the very rare occasion that they ever do back me up. i am working so hard to finish my degree in order to have a well paying job to get me and my son a home and a wonderful life but i just feel alone in a house full of people. i'm starting to feel really depressed and i am kind of at my wits end. any and all advice is welcome. edit from the bottom of my heart i want to say thank you for all the advice! i have honestly felt i have been the problem and have been so depressed and felt kind of hopeless, hearing your stories and knowing that it does get better has comforted me in a way i will never be able to put into words!!! so with all the amazing advice some big take away i am going to start is first and foremost a sit down with my mom and dad, then once we are all on the same page a behavior chart and just being consistent. if anyone cares to keep up i will keep you all updated!!!

i found out earlier today that i'm pregnant. mums who have been through the entire journey of being pregnant, can i ask you some questions?	hi all. i got a bfp earlier today and i'm really happy about it. this is my first ever pregnancy. i used a digital test. the test was showing pregnant 1-2 on the display. i believe this means 1-2 weeks from conception, but doctors date pregnancy according to when your last period was so i am actually 3-4 weeks pregnant. i have a few questions for experienced mums/moms about being pregnant. when did you tell your doctor that you were pregnant? is 3-4 weeks considered to be too soon? also, when did you tell close family members and friends that you were pregnant? right now only me and my so know. i'm not sure if it's too early to tell people or not. what vitamins/supplements did you take while you were pregnant, if any? i have been taking pregnacare conception since we started trying to conceive. should i keep taking them now i'm actually pregnant? also did you follow any specific guidelines about which foods to eat ? i already eat healthy but i've found there is a lot of conflicting information out there about what is safe to eat while you're pregnant. i also wanted to ask about symptoms. i only have a few symptoms right now. my boobs are slightly sore and i have a metal taste in my mouth. at what point did you start having morning sickness? i haven't had any nausea or been sick at all yet. also, when did you start to notice your boobs getting bigger? what other symptoms did you have in your first trimester? i really can't wait until i start actually looking pregnant and having more symptoms. thanks everyone for reading and replying.		/r/Mommit/comments/5lj4fa/i_found_out_earlier_today_that_im_pregnant_mums/	51	45	0	0.93	1483328492.0
help me get some sleep!!	my 3 month old is still sleeping in bed with us. he does sleep through the night most of the time but sometimes wakes up to eat. the thing is, he will only sleep in my arms and if i try to put him in his crib he'll scream and i'll have to redo our bedtime routine to help him fall asleep again. it's not that i'm not sleeping, i'm not resting properly because he's in my arms and i can't get anything done in the daytime. any suggestions from you mamma experts? thanks 	yaryoura	/r/Mommit/comments/5lpz29/help_me_get_some_sleep/	3	4	0	1.0	1483418516.0
what did you get your kid for christmas? how much is normal?	so i've been struggling with this as we just had our third christmas with our daughter. my parents are hoarders. every year we go so much stuff - a stocking that was our height stuffed to the brim with presents, then presents under the tree, then a present on christmas eve and also new year's. my parents always struggled financially and barely had enough money to cover basics throughout the year, so i always felt guilty about this ridiculous amount of stuff that never had anywhere to live once it was all opened because all our closets and shelves and every surface was just covered with stuff. last year i went home and i found presents i had never unwrapped as a child...they just fell underneath the bed i guess. we ended up giving our two-year-old a few books, a wood train set, some panties and socks, some magnetic blocks, and a little puzzle/board game. we also decided we should do one adventure every year so we went to a polar express thingy out of town. i'm curious to hear what others did to see what's considered normal or standard, if there even is such a thing. did you ever get what you felt was too much for your kids? or too little? did your kids care? do you have any rules about gifts? do you just set a budget and work within that? obviously our daughter is too little to request certain things so that isn't an issue yet.	makeitbettah	/r/Mommit/comments/5lsomb/what_did_you_get_your_kid_for_christmas_how_much/	36	28	0	0.93	1483459578.0
i need encouragement and advice i have a teething toddler, no income, no car, and i need a break right now!!!	my daughter is 16 months old, and is normally a really mellow kid, but the last few days, she's been teething pretty hard. first off is it okay to let her just cry it out right now? usually i don't but i need some time alone! last night she was waking up every few hours, crying her eyes out, and the only way i could get her to sleep was to sing the theme song from elmo's world and let her fall asleep on top of me. i didn't get much sleep. then today, i had to walk around town with her for miles without a stroller, running errands all day. i'm physically exhausted. now we're home and she's teething and cranky. i gave her baby tylenol and ambesol. i'm scared shitless right now because we're loosing our main source of income, we're flat broke, and i need to code a new resume tonight, and find work fast, or we won't have electricity this month and i won't be able to pay the mortgage - or the internet, which i need for work . her bedtime is in two hours , but i need a damn break ! she's currently with her dad right now, crying, but he's busy playing diablo 3 and i'm hiding in the bathroom. what the hell do i do? i'm at my end.

struggling to help my 27w pregnant wife.	hi mommit, my wife is 27 weeks with our first child. my wife is fit and and active, and as of 25w had only gained about three pounds since conceiving. her belly is now at the the stage where her clothes are starting to not fit. my wife is convinced she is a fat whale . this couldn't be further from the truth, however nothing i can do seems to convince her otherwise. my wife also is refusing to update her wardrobe with maternity clothing, which i feel will become increasingly problematic. my wife's feeling fat is likely exacerbated by a few older women at her work who make snarky or passive aggressive remarks. i am far beyond my ability to effectively help her to feel better, or see how beautiful she really is. mommit, is there anything i can do or try, that may help her?	skibby	/r/Mommit/comments/5m9y5l/struggling_to_help_my_27w_pregnant_wife/	23	13	0	0.94	1483658979.0
any other talking babies only say mama when they're upset/crying?	my baby girl has been babbling for a while. she is finally saying mama, but only when she's crying and looking for me.... for example when she wakes in the middle of the night and her dad goes in her room instead of me. or when i try to put her down for a nap and she's hungry and wants to feed first. she's pretty demanding and uh, vocal , so it's getting to the point where where i should be happy she's calling mama but it just stresses me out because she's also always scream-crying. / when do babies start saying mama in a happier context??

prek teacher made my son wear a pink coat on the playground. he was teased. what should i do now?	today my almost 5 year old son went to school with a tshirt and a sweater on and a toboggan hat. he also had a fleece zip hoodie type thing in his bookbag. so, come time to go to the playground, the teacher told my son to put his coat on and he said he didn't have one. they didn't check his bookbag, instead they put on a spare jacket that was apparently bright pink. i have raised an open minded child and he had no objections to wearing the coat. however, during recess, my son told me that he was teased by several other children and was called a girl, laughed at, and made fun of and that his feelings were hurt. i wrote the teacher and she apologized for making him wear the jacket. do i just drop it or should i say something to the director? any advice on what to say to my son? thanks.

newfound sleep issues at 6.5mo. anyone ever hire a baby sleep coach? what was your experience like?	i am getting desperate and seriously considering hiring someone to help me figure this baby out. i'd love to hear if others have tried online consulting with sleep coaches, and if they had success. why i'm considering hiring one.... my baby used to sleep 12hr stretches at three months. no waking to nurse . i know, right? i couldn't believe it either. it was short lived, however, as the four month regression hit. she never really recovered from that period. she started waking at 3am regularly, often wide awake and ready to play. i would leave her in her room after nursing, and she'd happily babble away for a couple hours until dropping off. we had a good thing going for about a month where i'd put her down for naps and bedtime, sing a song and walk out, and she'd fall asleep on her own. she'd take 30m naps sometimes and she always woke at 3 or 4 for nursing, but it was still pretty good. she always woke in the mornings smiling and happy. come six month growth spurt, she woke every three hours to nurse for a week. naps were terrible. but we kept up with her routine and hoped she'd go back to her previous sleep schedule. but no dice. since then, going on a couple weeks now, she's been having severe separation anxiety. she'll scream and cry in her bed as she watches me leave. used to be just bedtime, but these past couple days she's resisting naps as well. not only resisting falling asleep, but also waking up crying multiple times a night. her bedtime is 9, and she's been wak ing at 9 30, 10, and 11. it goes from crying out with eyes closed, and then escalates to uncontrollable crying. my husband described the sound as something like needing an exorcism . it really is that bad. she'll usually sleep from 11-3. on a some days, she'll sleep right after nursing, but then wake again at 6am and cry to either nurse or cuddle. other days, she'll wake to nurse at 3 completely awake, cry if i leave, fall asleep around 5, and wake for the day at 8. wakes crying. i am very careful to watch for sleep cues, tried different sleep schedules and have had success in the past but nothing is working now. she is otherwise very happy when she's awake. i am stressed beyond belief, however, and i think i'm actually losing my hearing from all the screaming.

second baby due in 6 weeks - what do i need?	a few weeks ago, a friend's wife, who has a 5 month old, found out i was pregnant and, looking at me like i had two heads, asked are you ready?? well, i thought i was but the closer it gets the more unprepared i feel. i think i did a lot more preparing before my son was born. this time i obviously have less time, but more experience and i figured we'd just play it by ear? i stopped by a friend's house the other day who just had her second baby 2 months ago and the house was a disaster and she and her husband both seemed pretty shell-shocked! i felt kinda bad for them - it got me thinking i should maybe give this some more thought so i'm not caught off-guard. i haven't packed my hospital bag yet.. i can't remember what i put in it last time. we still have most baby gear from 1 and we got a new car seat months ago. i know we need diapers and i just got a bunch of girl clothes for her.. so what else am i forgetting?	greensthecolor	/r/Mommit/comments/5o1z1j/second_baby_due_in_6_weeks_what_do_i_need/	7	9	0	1.0	1484453766.0

work-from-home moms, how do you do it?	i just started a job working exclusively from home, and maybe it's just the newness of it but i am having such a hard time setting aside time to just work. my oldest is in first grade so he's not an issue during the day, but my youngest is 15 months and that's where the real struggle is. he still naps a couple of times a day, but when he's not napping he requires hypervigilance or he's into everything. pulling things out of drawers, throwing every single toy around the house. one of the big issues is that i went into this thinking i'd use nap time as work time, but we live in an apartment complex and there's lots of noise. the landscapers are here at least twice a week with weedeaters and leaf blowers going for hours--always during nap time. and yesterday the maintenance crew was replacing a walkway right outside our front door. so babybutter's morning nap was about 1/3 of its normal length, and his afternoon nap was cut short because mil wanted to visit with me and see how my new-hire training went the day before. by the time my husband got home i was pretty much in meltdown mode. this is getting lengthy, but i wanted to see if anyone else works from home and doesn't have their kids in daycare . when and how do you fit it in?	toasted_buttr	/r/Mommit/comments/5p49y5/workfromhome_moms_how_do_you_do_it/	42	25	0	0.97	1484923774.0
advice for coping with separation anxiety.	baby girl turned 3 months old today and has started having terrible separation anxiety. i just went back to work, so i'm sure that's part of. friday she was screaming and inconsolable to the point i just called in for the day. then today she has basically refused to be held by anyone but me and stops crying almost instantly when she hits my arms. though i love how connected we are, i'm starting to worry about my husband's emotions. he is so great with her and is very supportive to let me hold her whenever i or she wants- i feel like he's feeling left out and he has made some man, she just doesn't like me comments. i can tell he's pretty bummed when she wants nothing to do with him. i want him to feel included and know how much we rely on him and appreciate him. how long do you think this will last? i know it won't be forever, but i'm hoping it will be short lived so daddy can get some snuggle time too!	jamielynn0528	/r/Mommit/comments/5pfm7m/advice_for_coping_with_separation_anxiety/	1	6	0	1.0	1485065985.0
would you unfriend people who didn't come to your child's birthday party?	hi everyone. so i threw my kid a birthday party. i told my closest friends who also have kids about it and they agreed to come. so one friend text me the day of that she would be there in a bit but then canceled literally at the time she said she would be there. and then, so i asked my other friend if she were coming and she took an hour to reply and finally said no she wouldn't make it with no reason to why. these are close friends of mine. i feel like we don't hang out as often at all and this was kinda the icing on the cake. i know things happen, but the way they canceled was rude to me. i also had another friend, who i kept asking if she would come or not because she has 4 kids and i needed to know if she would make it. last minute she tells me she can't make it cause she doesn't have a ride . at this point i just feel like not talking to them anymore, but would you think i'm overreacting?

what to do with son during leave 	good day everybody. i'm currently 6 mo preggo with my second. i plan to fully take advantage of my fmla/12 weeks during this pregnancy. my son is 2 yo as of this month, and i'm debating on what i want to do with daycare during this time. i would appreciate anyone's experiences. i have considered keeping his schedule pretty normal. son would go to daycare every weekday because he is a creature of habit, and honestly, he got me for 8 weeks all to himself when he was born. also my husband will be really busy with his work during my tentative delivery time so i may only get him for a few days vs a few weeks like last time. mil has taken off a week, but has yet to ask me my thoughts on it. no, i don't need you around while my tits are constantly hanging out. you've never seen me without make-up so unless you plan on being a maid, you can go to work. i'm really hoping she's doing this tentatively so she can watch our son during delivery. i really hope that's the main reasoning, but again... unsure as she has yet to talk to me. i have also considered just doing a partial daycare schedule. 2-3 days would be with me while the others are at daycare. allows some normalcy and him to adapt to changes with number 2. this also allows me some recovery time for napping on the days with me. another option would be to have him full time with newborn and myself. this seems most daunting, and i really don't want to do this, but am open to others' experiences. i realize it could save on daycare, and that's the only positive in my book.

how often is your toddler getting sick?	my little one is gonna be 2 in february, we've been taking him to the daycare center since autumn 2016, and he keeps getting sick not necessarily something hard but sick nonetheless. after several days of going to the daycare he comes with a fever, or stuffed nose, once he came down with otitis media; another time enterocolitis; now he's been with a fever for 2 days now and isn't going down. so i just wanna ask you moms/dads did your kid/kids get sick so often ? i was never able to take him to the daycare for more than 2 weeks straight. we've seen dozens of doctors and pediatricians, they just seem to be taking it lightly. any advice ?	feomothar	/r/Mommit/comments/5pvens/how_often_is_your_toddler_getting_sick/	9	6	0	0.88	1485253403.0

advice for dealing with a child who doesn't listen	my son will be 4 in a couple months. he is bright and curious and energetic. when i say he doesn't listen, i don't mean that he disregards what i say. he doesn't hear what i say because he won't stop making noise or talking. i have even gotten in the habit of calling his nam, clapping my hands, or doing something to get his attention prior to saying things. but he just continues to talk while i'm speaking. it's making me crazy and i'm struggling not to los my temper all the time. has any one else dealt with this or have any suggestions. thank you.

new here... baby is 10 months and i still have a hard time thinking about her birth, when will it get better?	i had a planned c-section for breech. it was terrible. the weeks before were terrible. that day was terrible. after was terrible. and if i even start to think about it now, i get teary eyed. i could go on and on about all the things that made it terrible, but i kind of just wish i knew how to get over it. i have talked about it with a few friends and one therapist...but the sadness is really lingering. i feel robbed, and unlucky and like it wasn't fair and that i didn't deserve it. so, now i'm turning to the internets to see if anyone else has gotten over to the greener grass. thanks.	meetriscuit	/r/Mommit/comments/5qedfi/new_here_baby_is_10_months_and_i_still_have_a/	30	24	0	0.95	1485481087.0

sahmom's - how did you transition from having your husband on paternity leave to you taking over?	my husband has been lucky enough to have four weeks of paternity leave. we are currently in week 3 of 4 that is allotted for him. i could not have done the last two weeks without him by my side. he has been there to change diapers, comfort our son, stay up with him during his witching hour and take care of me and the house. but from the sounds of it, he is going to want as much sleep as possible once returning to work. ie probably not going to handle mid-night diaper changes and has agreed to stay up with lo if need be until 10ish most likely. i've been the one handling the sleep times between 12-5am which i dont mind because hes being fed on demand and is going through some cluster feedings right now so i need to be awake anyways. i find i am only getting an hour or two of sleep at a time seperated by 1-2 hours each during the night...so i am lucky right now if i get about 4-6 hours of sleep from 8pm-8am. i count myself lucky for those hours, but by 5am i am pretty damn pissy. i know that lo sleep will be getting better and more spread out, but during the day i like to pump sometimes after a feed and if lo is fussy then it makes it so much harder. if i want to eat, it's like lo has a beacon that goes off that he needs me right then and there. how am i going to do this on my own? how did you ladies transition and keep your sanity? i have a few mommy friends but they are both due with babies soon and so they will be out for awhile. i have a mommy and me group on thursdays too, but what about the rest of the week? tl;dr husband going back to work, transitioning to sahm full time caregiver and scared i can't handle it.	fitmamaem	/r/Mommit/comments/5r2viv/sahmoms_how_did_you_transition_from_having_your/	4	2	0	1.0	1485804021.0

how did you adjust to life as a mum?	hi all, i have a question. it's not long to go til i have my first baby , and i'm feeling a lot of anxiety about becoming a mum. specifically, i'm worried about losing my sense of self and how i'll adjust to such a massive change. the fact that i'm studying the sociology of parenting and childhood for my doctorate doesn't help i feel like i know too much about all the wrong things. i know nothing about baby health and development, and far too much about all the social pressures mums face. i feel like theres so much to worry about, and a million things that could go wrong. what was the adjustment like and when did you start to get a sense that you knew what you were doing? how did you hold on to your sense of self? edit thank you everyone. am feeling a bit better.

close to transitioning to 1 nap, advice needed	my 13 month old has been taking later and longer naps, so that his second nap needs to be capped in order for him to be awake a sufficient amount of time before bedtime. his schedule lately looks like ~6 30am - actual wake time 7 00am - when i pick him up from his crib & feed him a bottle 7 30am - breakfast 10 00am - snack 11 20am - put down for nap ~12 45pm - wakes up from nap, bottle & lunch 3 15pm - snack 3 45pm - i put him down for a nap at this time as a 'last chance' to nap, because i wake him at 4 30pm 5 15pm - bottle 6 30pm - dinner 7 45pm - bedtime my questions are 1 should i just keep putting him down for the second nap at 3 45pm as long as he will sleep? 2 if you move bedtime earlier during the transition, how did you manage the feeding schedule? did you just try to cram dinner in right before the earlier bedtime? did anyone feel like maybe their kid woke up earlier due to the lengthened interval between dinner and breakfast? thanks!

something bad happening or just a kid wanting to leave school early? how to tell??	so, my daughter has attended an after-school program for the last 2 years. she's always said how much fun she has, etc. within the last couple of weeks she's started calling me on thursday to come pick her up early. the first time i was surprised, shocked and worried because i've never been called to pick her up sick before. she said her tummy hurt. yet, when we get home she's completely normal and never throws up, runs a fever or anything like that. the second time, same thing. i had a talk with her... is anything going on? are you getting bullied? inappropriate touching? all approached in a nice, calm manner so she didn't feel pressured or like she couldn't open up to me. third time, same thing... even the teacher calling me could tell it was bs but this time she goes in to her room all happy and excited to be home.. sickness magically disappeared. i told her then that unless she was really sick i needed her to stay at after-school because i can't be leaving work like this all the time just because she doesn't feel like going. today, it happened again. the teacher called saying no one had picked her up yet and i told her she was supposed to be in after-school and asked, did they not have it today?? she pulled the phone away from her ear and said, do they have after-school? yeah was the answer, then the teacher hands the phone to my daughter. i asked her what was going on and why she needed me to leave work again to pick her up and she was just doing her shy mumbling thing and wouldn't give me a straight answer. i said, well you better have a good answer for me when i get there. i picked her up and admittedly i was obviously angry. we had talked about this and i thought we understood each other. i asked her why and she says she didn't want to go, which then changed to i didn't think we had it today since it's the last day of the week , then it was damien told me we didn't have it, then it was i don't know i ask her again if anything is going on during after-school that i should be concerned about... nothing! no answer but no and mumbling. so frustrating!! she's at home now, i had to wake her dad up early so he knew she was home and i know she's playing on her computer now because i can see her browser history. my question is how can you or do you know if this is just her taking advantage of the situation, or if there really is something going on that i should be worried about?? help!!	kvthe	/r/Mommit/comments/5rpi2f/something_bad_happening_or_just_a_kid_wanting_to/	32	46	0	0.93	1486069882.0
sometimes you gotta make do with what you got..	my husband works out of town so once the little ones go to bed i'm basically a prisoner in my house most nights. my period decided to surprise me 3 days early and of course this would be the first time i can remember not having any pads in the house. i mean none. couldn't even find one in an old purse or buried in the bathroom cabinet. so what is a girl to do? i cut the elastic sides and the top part off a diaper and stuck that in my underpants! it actually worked quite well.	cal9687	/r/Mommit/comments/5s62op/sometimes_you_gotta_make_do_with_what_you_got/	9	89	0	0.99	1486276452.0
needed advice on two grandmas who wont get along	my lo was born three months ago, and to provide a little context both my mom and my partner's mom, don't like each other/get along. whenever my mom decides to pick up my son there seems to be huge tension, vice versa. since i live with my mother-in-law, she sees my lo the majority of the time. how can i address this issue/ keeping the drama minimal? how can i reduce this tension? i have mentioned keeping the peace for the sake of my son to both of them and it still seems to exist. i want my lo to be raised in two loving environments with two grandma's who love, respect each other and can model this behavior for my son for years to come. so far, i have spoken to my partner about it and he seems to get defensive, sides with his mom most of the time. any advice or suggestions?	numbertwomilf	/r/Mommit/comments/5sk14e/needed_advice_on_two_grandmas_who_wont_get_along/	10	39	0	0.91	1486451763.0

how do you take care of yourself?	hi all! i'm a new mom and the other day when he blessedly took a nap longer than 30 minutes, i sat on the couch and thought to myselfi should use this time wisely; i should work out or something. i've always been in okay shape but i am by no means a fitness guru. a quick google of postpartum workout left me feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, so i continued to just sit there, defeated by the baby weight that i was not losing. you see, i do well with specifics. i need an app or something that tells me exactly what to do. if anyone knows of one that exists, feel free to let me know! because for now what i've decided to do is kind of hack something together for myselfkind of a glorified to-do list where each day, i set a goal that is simple, concrete, and most importantly, achievable. it mixes physical tasks with emotional tasks that help me feel better about myself . i love taking care of my son. he is the best part about my days. but sometimes, i kind of forget to take care of myself. i think its a pretty common thing! we all laugh about how it's totally normal to be in pajamas at 5pm, or to go days and days without showering. i legitimately haven't shaved my legs in like, 2 months. i was thinking since i'm already doing the work of making my to-do list that i could share it with other mamas in an email newsletter or something. but does anyone else even feel like this is necessary or helpful? let me know! but most importantly, help me out in my quest for sanity what things do you do to help take care of yourself with a new baby or young children? 	j_earthmuffin	/r/Mommit/comments/5tv1qm/how_do_you_take_care_of_yourself/	8	12	0	0.82	1487015220.0
is this normal or something else? 	hey guys so my son just turned 4 last month. he's always been high spirited, energetic, funny, crazy engineer brain smart & empathetic. the flip side of that is he can be tenacious, singularly driven, full of energy that he can't contain, & directive. he just doesn't seem to understand somethings and keeps repeating behaviors despite consequences and redirection. for example, no matter what we do he's out of his room multiple times after bed time. i'm told this is just a toddler thing and he'll grow out of it. the big thing is that he's had trouble at day care preschool. our new one is really great and works with him . he's been having issues mainly with kicking & hitting the other kids for no reason. he won't nap and gets bored during nap and becomes noisy. he's great during learning time and structured play but can't seem to follow social norms during free play time. he's had some issue with biting randomly , spitting & smacking other kids butts . those three have gotten better. it's the kicking and hitting that hasn't. i'm pretty sure he is gifted and they do a good job of challenging him for a good part of the day. it's seems to be when its unstructured that these behaviors come out. at home he's a ball of energy. he will run around the house, plays with the dogs, his baby sister & loves to jump off the couch and build forts out of the cushions. sometimes i can't get him to stop and settle unless i put the ipad in front of him . he's always high energy, happy and loud. he's very curious and loves to learn. he will sometimes smack the dog as he walks past and gets corrected for that. we struggle because he is tenacious and so smart that he finds loop holes in rules and consequences. when i say why did you....? he responds with because i did that! i do get more out of him when i ask what happened? he's very empathetic and worries when someone is upset. he wants to comfort them but he doesn't understand that it hurts when you kick or hit someone. he's also a great talker and very communicative. i kinda blank out when it comes to this bc of my ptsd from my abusive childhood. i beat myself up bc i work in mental health with kids and teens and i have no idea if this behavior is normal or if he's adhd? if he was a teenager i feel liked i'd know better bc i work with teens more. i feel guilty bc he was at home with me for 2 years and didn't get as much social interaction as he may have needed. i feel like this is my fault. i just don't trust my own judgement and i worry because it's happening a lot at preschool. home is just a circus but that's probably bc my husband and i are more go with the flow people than routine people . so any thoughts or advice is appreciated. is this typical i just turned 4 behavior? have you guys experienced anything like this? is he just a boy who will grow out of it? or should i take him to get evaluated? does he need ot or play therapy? tia	Retrobebe83	/r/Mommit/comments/5u0eyy/is_this_normal_or_something_else_advice_xpost/	15	14	0	0.94	1487081742.0

how do you store your bottles?	right now, once a bottle or paci, etc is washed or sterilized it just goes on one of our two drying racks one of these but those take up a lot of counter space when we don't have a lot of space to spare. often they get moved to the table so we can cook dinner then back to the counter so we can eat and then back to the table to we can clean up, and it's just getting aggravating. >.< does anyone have any more space efficient bottle storage solutions? we only have 6 bottles right now but a small kitchen so i feel like i'm swimming in bottles, lol. edit we also don't have a lot of cabinet storage, unfortunately.	kimpers	/r/Mommit/comments/5vf7e8/how_do_you_store_your_bottles/	4	7	0	1.0	1487721422.0

advice for encouraging 15 mo old to talk more?	my husband and i are new parents and could use some advice. the pediatrician, at our daughter's 15 mo checkup about 2 weeks ago, said it's still early enough not to panic over, but it's a tiny concern that our baby doesn't talk a lot yet. needless to say, that's worried me. my baby isn't silent by any means, but mostly says mama, dada, no, and does babble. every so often she will repeat a word we say without being prompted or asked--its random...but won't do it again if we say the word again. she's suddenly and spontaneously said words like cat, meow, and wass this? those are rare though. she babbles, but my husband and i haven't been around a lot of babies to know if her level of babbling is normal. it seems normal to us. she was born 3 weeks early. she was an early walker , early to stand, early for a lot of physical milestones. she points to things. for example, she'll point to her nose if i ask where her nose is. she knows a lot of names for animals and seems to understand quite a bit when we talk to her. she understands, for example, when i say bring me a book and will choose a book from her shelf and bring it to me for me to read to her. we read dozens of books a day to her. we sing songs and we dance with her . she imitates my dance moves. lately, i've been facing her when i read to her now so that she can see my mouth move, and i'll point to a cat in a book, for instance, and ask what's this? can you say cat? she shows a lot of interest in watching me talk and will point at pictures in books, but still won't say anything back. if she wants things, she tends to make a cooing sound and gestures or points towards the item. she's recently learned to nod her head yes or shake her head for no. she only really says no no no when she's really mad about something. i've read that some babies are just more physically minded and some are intent on talking. is that true? if that is, she has definitely shown a lot of interest in improving her coordination and movement since birth. what are some things that my husband and i can do to encourage her to talk? i would love any advice you may have, especially if you've had a similar experience and your child came out fine. edit i just wanted to thank everyone for their thoughtful and helpful responses. i'll take what i've read and apply it to how we interact with her.	coffeeposer	/r/Mommit/comments/5wlkvs/advice_for_encouraging_15_mo_old_to_talk_more/	24	36	0	0.91	1488252063.0
advice about planning a vacation during school year	we are planning a vacation to disney in september mainly because it's less expensive when school is back in session. my daughter will be starting kindergarten in a new school and i am conflicted about whether to miss the first week of school which is probably three half days or two half days and one full day or skip the entire second week of school for the trip. i don't know if it's better to meet the teachers the first week and miss more school the second week or to miss less school the first week and be back in the saddle in school the second week. anyone with older kids have advice? am i over thinking this? for reference we are in new york city.	moretaj	/r/Mommit/comments/5x3ris/advice_about_planning_a_vacation_during_school/	11	12	0	0.88	1488467919.0
car seat gurus! which seat on the airplane?	 hey y'all i consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to car seats, but for the life of me i don't know what to do here. i am flying spirit airlines to ca and southwest back home to tx this weekend. my 16mo is registered as a lap infant. there is the possibility that if there is an extra seat i can use it for her, but that's not probable and is ultimately up to chance. however, it should be kept in mind. i will most likely be gate checking the car seat that i bring. 1. graco classic connect. height limit 19in weight limit 22lbs. 2. britax marathon. baby is easily within all limits. lo is currently 21lbs and 19in. should i bring the graco since she will be almost grown out of it and it won't be a big deal if it gets damaged? should i bring the britax because it will hold up better to being tossed in the plane? when it comes to maybe having a seat on the plane, ff is better because stewards won't make a big deal, which makes me lean britax. but i also don't want my $200 car seat to be ruined if i have to gate check it. i cannot afford to purchase her a seat the day before the flight so that option is out. i can easily stick either carsaeat onto the stroller to get to the gate. i'll be babywearing and using the stroller as a dolly. so! wwyd?	sas6709	/r/Mommit/comments/5xajec/car_seat_gurus_which_seat_on_the_airplane/	39	27	0	0.97	1488550413.0

at what age did your child stop using a pacifier and why?	why that age , and what were their previous pacifier habits? i'm trying to figure out when to have my son stop using a pacifier, but there's several factors to consider, and knowing some of your experiences will help. example my son is 18 months, and he only ever uses a pacifier for naps and bedtime, with the occasional exceptions long road trips and when he's inconsolable or we need to quicky calm him at church. i didn't introduce one until he was a month old. he stopped nursing at 13 months, and i had been weaning him to the pacifier instead of the breast at night for about a month before . paragraph of my thoughts relying on the binky is very handy, especially since my son is still too young for us to really soothe him by talking about the problem. my husband doesn't want to stop using the binky yet because it is still effective as a soothing aid. however, i don't want to have my son using it long enough to become unhealthily dependent, mess up his mouth, or make it harder to switch to something else. i also don't want to take it away too early if he still needs it, since he can't understand and that would bring him unnecessary stress. i stopped using mine at 4, which for most is too old. both myself and my husband have annoying oral habits like biting nails or chewing on things, and i don't want to encourage excess oral stimulation in my son. i'm aware that it's a need in infancy; i just don't want to inadvertently prolong that if it's unnecessary. any other things i should consider?	angela52689	/r/Mommit/comments/5z3vyo/at_what_age_did_your_child_stop_using_a_pacifier/	17	7	0	0.9	1489393089.0
cranky toddler support, advice, commiseration needed!	i have a 14 month old who is just a high-energy cranky kind of guy. he's happy and easy going in a sense, but the last couple weeks i think he is teething or something and he has been a total pita. just cranky and loud and he just seems unhappy. he had a checkup in that time and i specifically asked the dr. to check his ears so i know there's nothing medically wrong. but he's just high needs. has been since birth. he's always going, moving, doing, destroying something. i'm not sure if there is something i could be doing to help him? i don't even think i'm describing this all that well. basically unless he is being actively entertained, he seems disgruntled. i can't tell if it's teething pain or what is going on. it's not constant, but he's just generally a 'difficult' kid. . ideas, help, similar stories? tl;dr toddler seems cranky and needs to be entertained/monitored constantly. toys/activities to help? better baby meds?	percythedog	/r/Mommit/comments/5z5hbr/cranky_toddler_support_advice_commiseration_needed/	6	6	0	0.88	1489417629.0

how am i supposed to cook?!	we just got an allergy/sensitivity test done on the toddler since she's had a runny nose, pale face, and dark circles since she was about nine months old. our pediatrician always just said it was day care funk, but when our not-quite two-year-old has dark circles and a constant stuffy nose and cough... you seek a second opinion. i was pretty sure it would come back that she was allergic to cats or dogs . luckily, no pet allergies!!!! however. she came back with major sensitivities to gluten, dairy, eggs, bananas, beef, and garlic. okay, i can cut out gluten. i can cut out dairy. i can even figure out how to cut out eggs. bute garlic?! how the hell do people cook without garlic? we put it in everything! and we eat a lot of it. please, please, please! send me recipes! give me ideas. it's basically a whole30 diet, minus eggs as well, so we can make it work. but what do i use in place of garlic?! help!!!!

how to deal with mean toddlers	hello! i have a three year old boy. we have a few neighbors that have boys with similar age. my son is the youngest. recently one of the kids has been acting a little mean to my son when they are all playing together. he will push him away, tries to kick him, tries to spit on him and say things like you're not my friend or you are a cry baby. i get that this is kids play but he is only doing it to my son. this also happens in front of the boys parents and they don't say anything. our approach has been to try and distract our son away from the situation. when my son has tried similar things we've tried to correct it using phrases like hitting is not nice . i am very conflicted on how to deal with this situation. its hard to tell my son not to do something when he sees other kids doing it to him and not being corrected. i am also uncomfortable correcting other kids, especially when the parents are around. does anyone have any advice for me as a parent? am i over-reacting? is this normal? any advice on how i should help my son deal with this situation? thank you!	basherboy	/r/Mommit/comments/61cv80/how_to_deal_with_mean_toddlers/	8	11	0	1.0	1490402701.0

can i just express my frustration over weaning with people who get it?!	my 16.5 month old is still addicted to the boob. we've been slowly weaning but then we both got sick so i kept on nursing because i wanted to help him feel better and i didn't want to deal with him screaming when he didn't get it while i was sick . so two weeks ago we started then whole weaning process again. not offering, not refusing, but distracting him when he asked or pulled on my shirt. after a week, we had cut down nursing for 15-20 min after waking up to 10-15 min, the 10-15 min after i got him from daycare to 5-10 min, and 30-40 min before bed to 20-30 min. yesterday he did great. he woke up at 6 30 and nursed for 5 min and didn't complain when i took him off the boob. he nursed again for 5 min when i got him home after work we had plans for us to see a concert and he was going to have our friends high schooler daughter put him to sleep. i nursed him for about 3-4 min before we left and when we got home he was asleep . i had trouble sleeping since my boobs were so full so i hand expressed a little to relieve the pressure into a sippy cup. today, he was good in the morning with just 2.5 min as i played a song he liked and told him at the end of the song his milkies was going away. then around 2 his molar final popped through and he was screaming and not calming down. he kept asking for milk and i wanted to say no. i gave him a teether, and a homemade fruit/veggie popsicle in a mesh feeder, and dh begged me to nurse him. i told him i would nurse for a minute and he calmed down for a bit. i just nursed him before bed for about 5 min . he did great and is now asleep. this is hard work!!!	jewelgirl	/r/Mommit/comments/61imzz/can_i_just_express_my_frustration_over_weaning/	16	25	0	0.93	1490485223.0
how do you get a kid to poop on the toilet?	my daughter is 3 years and almost 2 months old. she has been daytime pee potty trained since last year may-ish, but she has never really been able to poop on the toilet. she never, ever has accidents, but she asks for a diaper to poop in. she typically sits on a toilet seat thing on the toilet, with her feet on a step stool that's high enough to lift her knees. we have tried a normal potty , but it didn't help. a lot of the time, she's too impatient to wait for it to happen, but she has also on several occasions sat there for a long time with no success. today she sat for 30 minutes, clearly actively trying to poop, until we gave up and put a diaper on... and within 10 minutes the diaper was full. we have a sticker chart up. it's been up for months and months and months... there are 2 stickers on there, which were just for the most miniscule little turds. she loves the gifts we've bought as prizes , so it's not a motivation thing, she just... can't. when she poops in a diaper, she stands up straight. no crouching. help! i know it's normal for some kids, but i need it to end now. any tips? anyone?	wanderingoaklyn	/r/Mommit/comments/61pbne/how_do_you_get_a_kid_to_poop_on_the_toilet/	13	23	0	0.97	1490578252.0

moms of 2+ - did you need more help when 2 came home? figuring out what to do.	tl;dr i was easily agitated by everyone when 1 came home and didn't want my mom around - i keep being told i'll definitely want her around this time since i'll have a 3 yr old, too, but i'm not convinced. when i brought 1 home, my mom stayed for a week. she wasn't helpful outside of lounging around, holding the baby sometimes. i had a c-section and was doing laundry, taking her to the store, and doing most of the baby stuff anyway. we don't have an amazing relationship, but i figured i'd appreciate her help when she was here. honestly it just annoyed me more to have her. i was thrilled to see her leave so i could be alone with my family. this time, i'll have a newly 3year old in addition to a newborn. 3 year old will be going to daycare during the day. she loves her gramma, but due to some mental issues my mom has, my husband doesn't want her alone with my 3 year old more than absolutely necessary. i don't have anyone else who can come stay with us with the new baby, so really my mom would be the only one who is able to help. do i really need the help like people are saying? it is truly different when you bring home a newborn when you already have a 3 year old or toddler at home? thanks!	loveinanelevator131	/r/Mommit/comments/62t60o/moms_of_2_did_you_need_more_help_when_2_came_home/	17	28	0	0.95	1491058459.0

what is your best single parent hack?	i posted this on the single parent thread but there isn't much activity on there so i didn't get a response. please help! i'm about to become a single parent of two children, aged 5 & 2. husband and i have been sleeping and existing separately for a few weeks now and i've decided it's time to move on. we had a good discussion around what will happen, he was hurt initially but agreed it is for the best. he works 6 days a week so he will see the kids on his day off and i've said he is welcome anytime during the week to have dinner with the kids or put them to bed etc so it helps them adjust to our new situation a little easier. the kids and i are moving out and taking 90% of the furniture but staying in the same area so it is close to the school. we will move in a few weeks once i have enough money together to afford my own place. i'm actually looking forward to it and i am trying to think positively about the whole thing even though i know it's going to be the hardest thing i'll ever have to do. so, i need all the help i can get right now. i want to know what your best single parenting tips or hacks are. what has gotten you through or made life easier for you as a single parent. i am open to anything and everything you suggest at this stage! thanks in advance!	hubstertrouble2017	/r/Mommit/comments/62yc1i/what_is_your_best_single_parent_hack/	25	57	0	1.0	1491116136.0
what do you do with a young toddler who won't eat?	she's 13 months old. i feel like this is momming 101 yet at every meal except breakfast, i'm at a loss. she'll like something one day and not the next. she'll push food around on her tray and screech and whine. she'll inhale cottage cheese and roasted red pepper but we can't do that every day . i find i keep offering different things, trying not to go back to trusty cheese and bread . i try finger foods, spoon feeding her, letting her use the spoon. i give her what we're eating, i make her her own food. i season things, i leave them plain. i've made patties and nuggets and mini muffins with eggs and shredded veggies. she loves plain yogurt, cheese, bread, soy butter , any and all fruit, oatmeal, anything in a pouch. i don't blame her, that's tasty stuff. but i want the girl to eat some veggies . too much dairy backs her up. when i offer something, should i just wait her out longer? i tend to go looking for plan b when she gets whiny. should i just let her eat what she wants? i really don't want to establish bad habits this early. she also has some molars coming in right now, but seems completely unfazed by it and will happily eat baby mum mums and raw apple pieces so i'm not sure it's a texture/pain thing. let me know how you guys approach this kind of thing. i feel like it's too early to take the that's dinner, take it or leave it approach.	snuglasfur	/r/Mommit/comments/633lsm/what_do_you_do_with_a_young_toddler_who_wont_eat/	21	7	0	0.9	1491181802.0

gripe water. how is it? anything else for gas buildup and belly?	any mums use it on older kids or themselves for reflux or gas or upset belly? i've read on it a little and considered buying it, but here it is slightly out of my budget range to buy a large container and come home to find it go to waste. should i give it a go? how does it work for you and what brands/types do you prefer i try? or any other solutions? my 14 yo has a lot going on and he gets severe reflux and upset belly and gas buildup occasionally and recently it's been worse. his doc and dietitian approve seltzers but he will not drink anything besides for waters, milk, his ensure, and darn koolaid so seltzer is no option. he has been off of simethicone oral for a few years which stopped helping.	justme059	/r/Mommit/comments/63rixt/gripe_water_how_is_it_anything_else_for_gas/	3	4	0	1.0	1491464292.0
how to pick a diaper/nappy bag?	hiya, so i'm looking to get a diaper bag to put my son's things in when we're out and about; a plastic carrier bag just isn't a long term solution. i feel a bit lost as there are so many out there. what did you look for in a diaper bag , what do/don't you like about yours, and do you have a specific recommendation on a bag? i'd ideally like something not too bulky and doesn't look loads like a handbag. slight preference for things available at mothercare and john lewis as i have vouchers for those stores. can't figure out how to cross-post in my sleep-deprived haze, so have made a post identical to this one in beyondthebump as well. edit thanks everyone, upvotes for all!

potty training prep who do i believe?	i'm reading oh crap! potty training . my son is only 16 months old but already knows when he is peeing/pooping/has pooped, will tell me when he has pooped, and has gone potty on command 3 times. . he is getting ready to transition to the toddler room at daycare . so i happened to mention his signs of readiness to the director, and she warned me not to wait too long past this window. i agree, because i can see his will and power struggle tendencies strengthening by the day. but daycare does a lot of the things the book says not to do, like sit the kid on the potty whenever they want to just experience it . everyone also tells me to have the same potty that they have at daycare. but daycare just has mini real toilets, whereas the book says to use the bjorn portable potty chair. daycare says boys take longer and they wait until the kid shows signs of readiness but the book says that's a myth. don't get me wrong, i don't want to be all by the book, but i just have no other experience to go off.	digitabulist	/r/Mommit/comments/64184l/potty_training_prep_who_do_i_believe/	9	7	0	1.0	1491580457.0
what advice would you give for helping toddler get over her fear of the tub?	i'm a ftm and my baby girl is 17 months. she is absolutely afraid of the bathtub. she will happily bathe in the sink, but she's starting to outgrow it. i've tried twice to do it. i've gotten in the tub with her and held her, but she whimpered or cried the whole time. i've tried to talk soothingly and show her how fun it is to play with toys. it might calm her, but the moment i need to soap her up or shift her a little, she panics again. i think the tub is just too big, the bathroom echoes too much. i'd like to get her in a swimming class but i worry this will be her reaction. should i just wait until she's older or are there ways that i can ease her fears so that she can find it fun? thanks to any experienced moms for their advice.	coffeeposer	/r/Mommit/comments/64ah1e/what_advice_would_you_give_for_helping_toddler/	9	6	0	0.88	1491699015.0
how to higher a babysitter?!	so we have no family alive that can be trusted with our kids. we have no grandparents, no aunts, no uncles, no cousins, and you get the idea. the few remaining family members we have have life styles that prevent them from being part of our lives. our friends, we have very few friends, are all smokers, emotionally unstable, or aren't kid people. how do we safely find a safe sitter? i have read a lot through google searches but none of it has made me feel empowered to start the process. yes we have our kid in daycare. i am not comfortable with our kids going to someone else's house because you never know who will be allowed inside. any advice is greatly appreciated. i need just a couple hours alone with my husband.	mollylks2play	/r/Mommit/comments/64doiu/how_to_higher_a_babysitter/	24	16	0	0.78	1491752736.0

advice needed. son does not respect daddy and refuses affection	please help. 5yo son does not respect his daddy and refuses to give attention/affection. what can i do to help them build their relationship? background info dh and i dated for 5 years, got married and had our son 5 years later. i am what others would describe as an attached-parent. if my son is in the same building, i am there...somewhere. either cleaning/cooking/playing with him. when he was four, we had some growing pains, but we have since learned how to interact with each other. our time together is pretty much tantrum free. my dh loves our son very much, but doesnt spend as much time or interacts with our son as much as i do. when were all home together, dh is occupied with other things. basically his lifestyle has not changed; he does as he pleases, for as long as he pleases. usually our son has to asks daddy to play with him. otherwise, dh is just hanging out watching our son and i play or hes on his phone. our son was 3 yo when dh finally watched him solo, while i went out with some girlfriends. recently dh interacts more with our son. sometimes dh will try to hug/tackle our son like i do, but dh is rejected with i need space from our son. this i need space phrase is something his preschool teaches, when a child doesnt like the actions from another child. my dh is deeply saddened that his son doesnt want him. and of course, our son will be an angel if he wants something from daddy. it absolutely breaks my heart to see them at odds. is there something im doing that his hurting their relationship? what can i do, to help enforce dhs authority in our family? what can i do to help build their relationship?

this is why i do my own laundry	i'm not sure if this is the right sub but i need to get this out. my husband is great. i'm really really lucky. however we each do our own laundry to keep from potentially ruining something. before we started dating i was with someone who did some laundry and ruined the whole load. that was the end of the relationship. anywho. we are at my in-laws. they are awesome too. i don't know how i got away with being this lucky. we're packing to leave tomorrow. we have a 2.5 yo and a 10wo. we've spent the week in the pool. 2.5yo pooped while in the pool - i'm in my suit in the shower with her trying to clean her off. i take my suit off after she's done and wash it in the shower - it's an expensive one piece made for large busts. i hang it up, finish my shower and get out. he starts collecting stuff to wash and i say my suit is washed and not to worry about it. hubs goes to do laundry. i go to switch laundry to make sure other stuff that needs to be hung dry get taken out. low and behold, my suit is in there. gah. obviously nothing i can do now. i know he was just trying to help, but seriously. this is the 4th day we've swam and the 4th time that i said not to wash it. just a rant and a whine. i know it's petty. thanks for letting me share.	tootsy584	/r/Mommit/comments/666nja/this_is_why_i_do_my_own_laundry/	7	12	0	0.78	1492559420.0
moms of older children that slept on you for and extended time, i need your advice!	my little guy is 1 month old, and since day 5 he's been sleeping on my chest at night. mostly because i was scared something would happen while i was sleeping and not hear him. now i'm more confident and i'm ready for him to sleep in his bassinet next to my bed. the problem with this, he won't sleep for longer than 15-20 minutes by himself. i've tried two different sleep sacks, a normal swaddle, nursing him to sleep, laying him down drowsy, laying him down fast asleep, and i can only listen to him cry for 20 minutes before i get upset and have to pick him up. i need to know that continuing yo let him sleep on me will not cause issues later on in life. i don't know what else do to...

any advice for relieving pain of cutting 1st molars at night? please?	my poor girl just turned 1 and has been going through some awful teething pain, which i assume to be her 1st molars coming in . she's been shoving her figures as far back in her mouth as she can get and just screams . she's been having some trouble sleeping for the past couple of weeks while this has been going on, but last night was just god awful. i gave her some motrin a little while before bed to help with the pain , but i had some trouble getting her to go to sleep. after i finally did though, she woke up an hour later screaming bloody murder and was inconsolable. she carried on like that for over 2 hours until i was able to give her tylenol on top of the motrin . after the tylenol kicked in, she chilled out and i was able to get her back to sleep until 5am. beyond loading her up with medicine and playing the waiting game, is there anything else i can do to help her get through this? i tried to give her a cold washcloth, but she pushed it away and started crying even harder . i'm assuming she was actually cutting one last night and hopefully the next few nights will be a little better... but there are more to come and i might lose my damn mind between now and then. haaalp! tl;dr dd seems to be cutting her 1st molars and can't sleep. anything else i can try other than motrin and tylenol?	lleahmurr	/r/Mommit/comments/6914cs/any_advice_for_relieving_pain_of_cutting_1st/	11	24	0	0.95	1493826193.0

advice needed and coping with my son	so bit of background, i had my daughter about 2 years ago after months of screaming i finally got her diagnosed with a cows milk allergy. after everything settled down amd she was and is absolutely fantastic, but i felt like i was robbed of her being a baby i never got to fully enjoy as she screamed from morning to night. when she was 10 months old i fell pregnant but sadly lost my angel at 3 months. around 4 months later i fell pregnant again with my son. when he was two weeks old i noticed ge had same sites my daughter and was so relieved when i was able to nip the months of allergy screaming in the bud, however he has the most horrendous silent reflux amd we have had months of screaming struggling to feed him been a absolute nightmare, he has continously had to have medication upped and nothing seems to work long term. i am really struggling to deal with my emotions around this he is no where near as bad with it but everytime the scream starts i get so mad i shouted at him my daughter amd partner, i feel i'm getting worse with it too, my daughter now says shut up as soon as he starts, this only started today amd it's absolutely broke my heart hearing it and i no it can't continue. i need some advice or ways of dealing with this. i'm too ashamed to admit to anyone i no so don't really have anyone to talk to.

bringing 4 month old on beach vacation. any tips?	my husband and i will be taking our four month old son on a beach vacation next week. his mom has rented a beach house that is just a couple of hundred feet away from the water and we'll be staying for 4 days. we've taken bub on a long car trip when he was 3 months so i'm not too worried about that but i am concerned about being prepared for the beach itself! our pediatrician cleared us to use sunblock. we have some swim shorts and swim shirt, hat, umbrella and beach towels. my husband mentioned bringing some sort of seat but i think that may be too much. we have a bumbo seat that i hate and we never use, that's the only thing small enough to bring along that he could sit in. am i missing anything obvious or not so obvious? any tips on surviving this and still having fun? any advice is appreciated!!	steffigeewhiz	/r/Mommit/comments/6ag5rd/bringing_4_month_old_on_beach_vacation_any_tips/	9	7	0	0.9	1494455752.0

to the boy who made me a mom.	to the boy who made me a mom. growing up i always thought about my future - i've been planning every part since i was a little girl. every time we drove past cmu i'd imagine what it would be like to be a student there someday - it was the only college i wanted to attend. i thought about what i wanted to be when i grew up . i wondered who i'd marry. i dreamt about having a family one day, how i had to have two boys and two girls. i've always been excited about having a little girl because i never had a sister and i figured that was the next best thing. however i specifically wanted my first child to be a boy, because i wanted my kids to have an older brother that would care for and protect them. but i was never too excited about the idea of having a boy as i was of having a girl. in my mind boys were too dirty, too rambunctious, and the biggest downfall...their clothes weren't as cute as girls clothes were. then came you. i've always heard stories of how women knew what they were having before they found out from the ultrasound. mothers instinct , they'd say. i thought there was something wrong with me because i had no idea what you were. i went through every old wives tale and it was always a toss up. morning sickness. girl. headaches. boy. high heart rate. girl. dry hands. boy. we couldn't wait until 20 weeks to know if you were a girl or a boy so i made an appointment to find out at 16 weeks. i tried to prepare by telling myself i didn't care what you were as long as you were healthy. as long as our baby made it this time. but the closer it got, the more nervous i was. i hoped you were a girl. i even told my mom how boys scared me and i wasn't sure how i was supposed to take care of one. the time came for our gender appointment. as i was laying there on the chair twisting and turning every which way i was getting more and more excited, and also more nervous... the tech was showing us every single part of you. i loved seeing you, but i really just wanted to know what you were. she finally found the sweet spot.. as i looked at the screen i knew. is that a... yep, the tech said, it's a boy! your daddy was so excited! he couldn't wait to teach you everything about sports, and of course he was excited about keeping his family name going. honestly, i was a bit disappointed. after the appointment i needed some retail therapy so we went to babies r us and got some cute clothes for you. it made me feel a bit better. when the midwife set you on my chest after you were born, every bit of disappointment and fear i had felt about having a boy disappeared. you were perfect. you're six months old now and you're inquisitive, determined and smart. you're tough and at the same time you're sensitive. you are perfect in every way. i couldn't imagine you being anything other than everything you are. thank you for reminding me what i really wanted all along. thank you for being the sunshine in my day. thank you for challenging me, and thank you for changing me. thank you for choosing me. thank you for making me a mother.	pxtnsmama	/r/Mommit/comments/6bd113/to_the_boy_who_made_me_a_mom/	4	83	0	0.9	1494881348.0
screaming bloody murder, please help!	hey mom's! i have a 12.5 month old that has for the most part been a great sleeper. he always took his last bottle before bed and was out for the night occasionally waking up once for a night bottle. now, for the past 2 weeks, everytime he gets to his crib he is screaming bloody murder. if i was a neighbor i would think something was terribly wrong. we live in an apartment so if there is anything besides letting him cry it out, i would love to hear it! he will wake up 2 or 3 times a night screaming as well refusing to sleep again. his pediatrician didn't seem concerned, as she said it's a phase, but i'm worried it's becoming a habit plus that he's not getting enough night time sleep. please help if you have any advice!	odwalla1	/r/Mommit/comments/6be3ba/screaming_bloody_murder_please_help/	5	2	0	0.67	1494892865.0
advice please	has anyone ever experienced hate for their child's father ? i regret ever telling my daughters father that i was pregnant i wish i could go back and never tell him, we were never fully together but we tried when i got pregnant and then he turned to drugs and cheating, now she's four and he only has supervised visits but talks down about me to my daughter and encourages inappropriate behavior such as throwing things at me and swearing at me, my daughter says she's scared of him but likes playing when he comes over sometimes i feel depressed all the time because i don't want him around my child he's toxic and there's nothing i can do to get rid of him, i guess maybe i just need to vent because i know i can't change my situation but i don't know how much more i can take of the threats about taking me to court i know my child would be not safe alone with him and the thought of it makes me want to literally drive off a bridge i'm so scared of him being alone with my child that it keeps me up every night	Mamabear1229	/r/Mommit/comments/6bef78/advice_please/	12	16	0	1.0	1494896783.0
potty training help/advice.	my son is 29 months. when he turned 2 i started potty training but he showed no interest so i said i'd wait and try whenever he started to show me signs that he was ready. i do ask him throughout the day do you need to go potty? sometimes he says yes other times he cries and wants nothing to do with it. the past few days he's been saying too tight and owie and will pull at his pull up or just completely take it off. he'll ask for undies or even go get them himself, but then still refuse to use the potty other than maybe once or twice throughout the day. we're having so many accidents and i feel like i'm cleaning up pee puddles and washing underwear non stop. i thought it was maybe a sign that he was ready, but is it not? do i make him wear the pull ups or do i just keep putting up with the accidents? i'm at a loss! anyone else deal with this or have suggestions as to where i go/what to do from here?

moms who were unsure whether they wanted children, what made you decide?	hi mommit, i searched the subreddit and didn't see this question asked, so i thought i'd give it a shot. i'm 26. i'll probably be getting married in the next couple of years. neither my so nor i have any strong opinions on children, other than that we hate when they scream. he thinks he may want them some day but isn't sure. very laid back guy. i, on the other hand, have always thought i probably wouldn't want children because i don't want to pass on any anxiety/depression to a child. but now i don't know. i want to want to have kids. i think i may want to be a mom but i don't know that i would be a good one. i don't want to be anything like mine and i'm scared i would repeat her mistakes. how did you decide that children were for you? was it that you found the right man ? was it how you envisioned your life moving forward? did you ever worry about passing on mental/physical conditions? edit thank you all so much for your responses. i have been silently reading them over the last couple hours. all of your children are so lucky to have you as mothers and you have helped me feel like if i were to have a child one day, i could make its life happy and meaningful.	shadownie	/r/Mommit/comments/6c5mk5/moms_who_were_unsure_whether_they_wanted_children/	30	37	0	0.97	1495219911.0
when does mom get a day off?	husband has 2 days off a week. i really looked forward to these days so i can do a few things. but this never is the case. he thinks watching the baby is putting her in a pack n play and only interacting with her when she cries... any advice in working with him to change this behavior? the only time i get time to do anything is if i physically leave the house. but it's a rehab and i enjoy manual labor and am always the one watching the baby. i am becoming resentful of him. thanks in advance	JEMPhish	/r/Mommit/comments/6d4ndn/when_does_mom_get_a_day_off/	9	6	0	0.76	1495656415.0

when does the clinginess end?!	i love my babies, i do. i have a three year old and an 18 month old and they're adorable and cute and all that fun stuff. but they are driving me crazy. wherever i am they have to be. and of course if there's no toys where i am, they're getting into a whole bunch of other stuff they're not supposed to be getting into. if i sit down even for a minute, one of them is instantly climbing into my lap. if i let her, my 18 month old could sit in my lap for hours. they quite literally will grab the back of my pant legs and walk along with me everywhere. they have a playroom full of toys and books that don't get played with because they're in whatever room i'm in instead. i love them but i can't spend all my day sitting on the playroom couch just so they'll do stuff. nothing would ever get done and my house would fall apart. i understand that in retrospect one day i'll miss them at this age. but right now i'm losing my mind.

how do i cope with missing out on things as a young busy mother?	hello redditors who frequent mommit, thank you for reading my post! i have a 2 month old baby girl who i love with all of my being and soul. she requires a lot of time and attention, and i don't really mind it because children alone are quite entertaining and eventful all on their own. but for a while now i've been feeling quite sad because i don't have much to do outside of take care of her, the many things i do enjoy doing aren't things i can do with her strapped to my chest. the reason i'm posting now is because i tried to make plans for this weekend that didn't pull through and it made me cry and i'm having trouble coping. i don't know where else to go or who else to talk to because -i know it's silly- but feel guilty for even wanting to do anything that doesn't involve me having her right by my side with my attention. it makes me feel like i'm ditching her to have fun all by myself. i know it doesn't seem rational, but i hate doing things without her, it makes me feel like a neglectful bad mom. i just need some support from other moms and advice on how to deal with these feelings and things. i've always been a shy and private person, so talking this out with others in person feels uncomfortable and embarrassing because my problems seem so silly and insignificant. i need to vent, and i'd love the support and advice of other more experienced mommies, and mommies who are experiencing the same problems. i love basketball, i have all my life! i was a decent player and have always played to have fun. i have never gotten upset or mad playing the sport so i have always loved it, it allowed me to be active and social which are two things i am very bad at but love doing. so when i found out about a local tournament that was being held this weekend i got super excited to put a team together with my sister and others who i'd love to play with because it's been so so so long since i've played competitively due to focusing on finishing highschool and being heavily pregnant and nowwww taking care of my baby and exclusively breastfeeding her. honestly it's been long since i've done anything and looked forward to it as much as this! so i was hoping it would work out somehow and i'd get to play with all my loved ones. that didn't happen though. i knew, as soon as the first two people declined, that my plans weren't going to work out. one after the other my family and friends told me they had other things going on that day and they wouldn't be able to make it. i kept trying to find more people too, ones i didn't talk to as much but didn't mind playing with. they had plans too, or straight up didn't reply to me at all. as soon as the last person i asked told me that they actually had already been asked to play by another team i broke down crying. this was going to be my first time playing in over 4 years, i was so excited and looking forward to it. it was a treat for myself and i put aside my feelings of guilt on letting someone else take care of my baby while l played for a few minutes on my own. i told myself that i deserved this after working so hard to keep my baby happy and healthy, i deserved it because i stayed up night after night with her during her rough patches, after all the dirty diapers and clothes, after the sore painful and blistered nipples from breastfeeding, after the painful non-medicated labor-birth and the long post-partum healing process. this was going to be my own fun, a fun i haven't experienced in a long long time. it was the reward ,besides my baby, for all the hard work i did. these thoughts really hyped me up and made me excited for the weekend and ultimately just signed me up for a more intense disappointment, so i screwed myself over which is my fault really ;-; but when my plans didn't work out, it really hurt me. i feel like none of my friends or family even care enough to even try pull through and have fun with me. there has been other times i've asked them to visit, my close cousins especially, to which they'd say that they'd come the next day and not show up.... i feel like this all sounds melodramatic, but i needed this now after a long time of doing nothing besides going for walks and shopping for myself and my baby which is pretty much the only outside activity i get living in a more rural part of southern alberta where very little goes on and there is only a select things to do that i can't really do with a baby.... . my last plans also didn't work out because my baby shower date lined up with the date of a local convention that i wanted to attend. i don't have a lot of money so it was either baby shower or convention. i'd hate myself if i'd skip my baby's once in a lifetime event for an event that happens anually. i still however felt very sad about missing it because it's the only one close by i attend. don't have money or time to go to farther and bigger ones sorry for going off there, i just wanted to get it out of my system so i would stop feeling so bad about it. things are more difficult to do with a baby but not impossible, i love her unconditionally so it's all worth the hard work and devotion. it's just that i feel sad because of the lack of fun things to do and the disappointment of not getting to do all the activities i enjoy and love. how do you other mum's manage and cope with the lack of freedom and baby friendly activities that there seems to be? what about the disappointment you feel when you have to miss out on something as a busy mother?

toddler lies to skip nap or to get ice cream. how can i handle it?	 my husband and i have started noticing that our dd is lying to have her way... yesterday morning she went to the park with grandma and grandma bought her an ice cream. in the afternoon, she went to the park with my husband, and asked for ice cream again. husband asked her did you have ice cream with grandma? to which dd replied no, i didn't . husband had a hunch this wasn't true and called grandma. he got her the ice cream anyway, but he came home a little bit upset. we tried to talk to her about lying and how it's not nice, but i have the feeling she wasn't listening... today in daycare, we found out that she refused her afternoon nap because daddy told me that i'm a big girl and i don't need to sleep in the afternoon . needless to say, he did no such thing, nor did anyone else in the family! i researched toddler lies a bit yesterday but the articles i found were about kids not wanting to admit they had done something bad, or just telling tall tales like we have an elephant in the garden . the articles all said that there's nothing you can really do about this, and that you should humour them and go along with their stories because they are proof of a developing imagination. and the emphasis was that at this age they don't really know what lying means, that most lies are just strong wishes they have/stories they make up and so they convince themselves that they are true. i don't know, somehow what we experienced feels a bit different, but i may be mistaken. it's like she's thinking that if she'd said yes to daddy when asked if she'd already eaten ice cream, she wouldn't get another one and so she chose to lie about it. what do you think? i'd appreciate any stories and opinions about toddler lies and how to teach a three year old that lying is not ok.	lucyinthe	/r/Mommit/comments/6gszrs/toddler_lies_to_skip_nap_or_to_get_ice_cream_how/	13	35	0	0.97	1497282034.0

how do you get help for potential postpartum depression or anxiety when you can't afford help?	i'm not sure where to post this question on reddit so i decided to ask other moms. i feel like i need help with my mental health after having my baby , but my insurance doesn't cover behavior health so i can't afford help. i live in a small town so there aren't resources for help here and even if there were it would be from people i know so i wouldn't be comfortable talking to them. i just don't know what to do. i have tried dealing with it myself, but i get to the point where i flat out hate my baby and i start wishing i could die so that i don't have to take care of the baby anymore. i just think he would be in better hands if i was out of the picture even though i'm not actually a bad parent. i was okay for a few months because i went back to work so i could leave my baby, but my job is seasonal so now i'm stuck with the baby and i hate it so bad. i just want to be able to take care of him without hating every second of it. yes, he was wanted and i do have a husband, but he works such long hours. if any of you have any clue how i could get help i would really appreciate it, because right now i feel like i am drowning.	547684	/r/Mommit/comments/6hahnu/how_do_you_get_help_for_potential_postpartum/	22	32	0	0.96	1497474701.0

shampoo suggestions?	my daughter turns two tomorrow and has inherited her father's sweet, gentle curling hair. however, she unfortunately also inherited my super thin, super fine hair. i've been noticing, as her hair grows longer, that johnson&johnson and other baby soaps dry her hair out terribly and make it frizzy and brittle. i have zero clue what to do for her hair. i'm a wash with cheap shampoo, condition if i have time, and throw it into a ponytail still wet kind of a girl. my hair is also bone straight. what do you suggest i do for her hair? i want to make sure it's hydrated while also encouraging the curl that is starting to develop. are there any good brands of shampoo that are baby safe for curly hair?

update why!?	i don't know how to attach from mobile so i apologize for not having a link to the original post. i'm pregnant. it happened while having an iud and it is ectopic. about 3 weeks ago i was given a double shot of methotrexate - it's a cancer/rheumatoid arthritis medication - as the first step in terminating the pregnancy. it was a hard day. it's been a difficult 3 weeks. my ob/gyn just called - the shots didn't work. i have to go in for a 2nd round. if these fail surgery is next. let me say this the medicine makes you sick. it makes you fatigued. i don't want another round. i don't want to do this. i want it to just be done! my husband has been my rock. my kiddos are far too young to understand why mommy has to sit down a lot. they just want to play, and when he gets home from work i get sent to lay down while he takes them on until their bedtime. we weren't trying obviously, but we were hopeful and had even laid out plans for what we would have to do to make a 3rd baby work in our current small space. nope. now it's just heartache and being scared. tldr ectopic pregnancy has got the whole house up in a cloud of worry, and uncertainty. but the kids are great.

toddlers sharing bedroom advice needed!	so we are expecting 3 in the fall and wanted to move our 18mo old son out of the nursery and in with with his big brother now so we have ample time to adjust before new baby comes. we stagger bedtimes but things very rarely go well. before we had simple and pretty regular bedtime routines and have tried to keep them as much as possible. we also created 3 simple rules we relay to 1 that he repeats back and a reward system for following the rules-the reward is first thing in the morning. the problem is the whole thing seems to be making 1 way too giddy. he has often woken 2 up either when we put 1 to bed or wakes up waaayyy to early and wakes little brother up then. 2 is non-verbal and in therapy so he cant even tell 1 as much as no-he just crys. husband and i are at our wits end because we try to be more hands off, i.e. let kids suffer consequences of choices , but hate that 1's choices are affecting 2 in a way he can't influence yet. in normal situations, 1 does pretty well at stopping when people tell him to, just 2 can't yet. and we need this to work with the way our little house is layed out and that the deadline/reccommendation for making big changes before a new baby is drawing nearer. any advice with having two small kids in the same room would be much appreciated.	jcnobes	/r/Mommit/comments/6ic1ph/toddlers_sharing_bedroom_advice_needed/	3	9	0	0.91	1497936493.0

work/family balance advice needed	i am currently on maternity leave and recently got an offer to return to a full time position in a different department at my work. my current job is part time which is ideal for family life.. but the department is pretty lame. i am not able to do meaningful work due to organizational issues and coworkers . the new position would allow me to grow in my career, do more meaningful work, and get more rapid experience toward licensing. the obvious answer seems like to stay with my current position as we don't need the extra money, but i am working because i want to do important work and make the world a better place...given my current position, it kind of just feels like going through the motions to get a paycheck rather than doing work that i feel is ethically important. i just need some advice do you think doing morally satisfying work could justify spending more time away from your family? i'm afraid it will feel like a missed opportunity no matter which decision i make.	tokimarco	/r/Mommit/comments/6j504b/workfamily_balance_advice_needed/	5	6	0	1.0	1498262119.0
poo problems advice please! - 3 year old	backstory we have been toilet training my daughter consistently since she was about 2 and half. we have been mostly successful with wee so far, but have never really had any success with getting her to poo on the toilet. we have tried a consistent hourly routine, reading books on the toilet, blowing bubbles on the toilet, bribery, having her clean herself, talking with her about it, watching us poo etc. the list is endless. she also goes to daycare three days a week, and has most of her poo accidents there. i have been trying not to stress about it, and my current routine is only having her in nappies for naps and overnight and while at home there hasn't been any accidents in her pants, however it is pretty obvious she is holding it in until she has a nappy on. i was thinking of getting rid of nappies all together, using some plastic sheets on her bed, cold turkey. what do you all think? tl;dr 3 year old daughter holding poos till she has a nappy on. should i get rid of them all together? any other methods for poo training?	rooizoo	/r/Mommit/comments/6jcre9/poo_problems_advice_please_3_year_old/	3	3	0	1.0	1498368326.0

how am i supposed to feed my 1 year old?!	my son just turned 1. he loves any and all foods, and i usually just give him bites from my plate if i happen to be eating around him. outside of that i just nurse whenever he wants to nurse, send breast milk to daycare , and he eats whatever snacks the daycare provider prepares. i want to give him more of an eating schedule so that he gets used to feeding himself at regular intervals throughout the day when he's not in daycare. but i have no idea how to prepare food that's safe for baby. i am terrified of him choking. over the weekend i gave him some cut up bananas, turned my back for a moment, and turned back to find him nearly choking because he shoved every piece into his mouth and it smashed back into a huge, unswallowable piece. i've seen suggestions along the lines of half a turkey sandwich and just imagine my kiddo taking the biggest bite he possibly can and choking. or cut up apples; how small do i cut them?! apples are hard and he only has teeth in the front. is he truly ready for apples? he shoves food into his mouth faster than he can actually eat it. it's terrifying. what foods should i be preparing for him? how small and/or hard must something be for it to be a choking hazard? do i still need to sit and watch him for every single bite until he manages his eating pace better? i am so lost! thanks for any insight you can provide.	bitchesonthescene	/r/Mommit/comments/6k4bs6/how_am_i_supposed_to_feed_my_1_year_old/	18	31	0	0.92	1498690763.0

i dont know what else to 	my son is going to be 1 years old in just a few very short weeks and he still has so much trouble sleeping. his doctor knows about it and has offered advice as far not letting him take too many or too long of naps during the day, only giving him formula at night since he really enjoys his bottle. he's given me two very very mild sedatives for him. one of them was actually for his allergies but the doctor said it could make him really tired. neither of which make him the least not tired. i do everything i'm supposed to do when giving him then medicine as far as waiting until bedtime and i also try my best to drag him out throughout the day and much as i can so that by this bedtime there's a chance he will be tired. but nothing and i mean nothing is making this kid tired enough to sleep more than a naps worth at a time. now i mean it's not like he never ever has before. he had a lot of trouble, but then he was doing really well until he started getting his teeth. so that was the excuse then. he's cutting teeth, it's painful. i get it. now he's got 6 teeth. and they are all the way through and he hasn't been showing signs of getting any others right now. he's gotten really sick a few times also and with his allergies, there are nights that are just worse than others, but you expect that. you expect to be up with your kid when they are sick or when they are growing fricken teeth through their head ............ what you don't expect is to be up every single night until he just decides he's done playing. and i mean a full day/full night's worth of full on play time. hours and hours at a time to only take an hour and a half nap and be ready to go again . i feel like a total butthole when i complain about it. i'm a good mom. i know i'm a good mom... but i have no idea what i'm doing wrong. obviously i'm doing something that isn't working . his doctor offered to give him a sleep study, he had a nurse jot down my take on his sleeping schedule on two separate occasions and has yet to get back to me about it. even when i bring it up to him or even his other doctor who is his primaries assistant it's like they avoid it at all costs. honestly, i don't want to shove melatonin down his throat just so i can get a decent night's sleep. i won't judge anyone who does it or who has.. but i don't know if i feel good enough about it. he's not even one yet ... i can't just go buy some benedryl and knock him out for a nights worth of sleep. even though i've had like 3 mom's tell me to just do it. i can't edit i can't believe how many people replied with stories and advice. i live in a house full of people and i have family all over me all the time and i've never been able to explain to anyone your i feel without feeling like it was my fault in the end. thanks to everyone who took time to write, that's awesome.

any other moms with a 9 month old out there? what is your sleep routine like??	please help. i'm so confused about what we should expect our 9 month old girl to be doing as far as sleeping through the night. i'm an exclusive pumper, she takes about 20-24 ounces a day and eats 3 small meals a day of pure/cereal/yogurt. our pediatrician said to cut out the night feedings cold turkey at 6 months , but when we tried it just didn't feel right. last week, my husband decides we should try again and i reluctantly agreed. she screamed for an hour and a half while he checked in every few minutes and it was torture, but the next few nights she did great so i thought wow it worked out. on the best night she slept from 6 45 pm to 4 15 am with no wakeups at all, but seemed ready to start the day around 5 . another night she slept 7 15-5 00. but she slowly has gone back to waking up once a night, usually around 2-3 am, and will not settle without getting a bottle in her mouth. last night she went down at 6 55 pm and woke at 2 06. i tried to soothe her by rubbing her back and giving her the pacifier over and over again for more than a half hour. she was screaming her head off and repeatedly sitting up/trying to stand. finally i gave in and got a bottle. she only ate about 2 ounces and fell back to sleep until 6 10 . i've read all the damn books and blogs out there and they all conflict so i'm hoping to get some real advice from other moms out there. are there really 9 month old babies out there that sleep 11-12 hours straight?? any advice is much appreciated!	njteacher	/r/Mommit/comments/6l0a5b/any_other_moms_with_a_9_month_old_out_there_what/	14	10	0	1.0	1499092974.0

he doesn't want a bottle	my almost 7 month old son isn't a big fan of drinking from his bottle anymore. he was breastfed for the first two weeks of his life, then we switched to formula. he had no issues with that transition. right before he turned 6 months old we started him on rice ceral and other purees'. now, we can't stop him. he loves to eat anything we put on a spoon. the problem is that he doesn't want his bottle anymore. he turns away from it. i was only giving him around 4-5 bottles a day 6oz each. my question is, is it okay to keep reducing the amount of formula he has a day? what is the minimum amount i can feed him? when can i stop formula? i was told that babies should be drinking formula until they are one year old. how do i give him the nutrition he needs without forcing him to drink formula ?	emmgrr	/r/Mommit/comments/6murfw/he_doesnt_want_a_bottle/	5	2	0	1.0	1499874172.0

advice on four month old schedule	hello, fellow mommit friends. i could use some help with my daughters schedule. she is four months old and we're just getting a routine established. we were traveling a lot for the first few months so we didn't have much consistency. now i'd really like to get into a routine that doesn't involve her waking up several times a night to eat! here's a rough schedule- most of this changes day to day 8 15am baby wakes up, i change her diaper and we play 9 30 nurse 10 00ish nap, hopefully in crib 11 45 nurse afternoon- no consistency. she normally goes about two hours between feeds, and about the same between naps. a lot of days she will sleep for 20 minutes in a crib, wake up to eat, play for a few minutes, and then get fussy and go back to sleep in my arms for a longer nap. 7 45pm 20-30 min nap 9 00 nurse and then bedtime routine. pajamas, read books in the rocking chair, then put her in her crib awake but sleepy. 9 30 with white noise machine and lovey she goes to sleep in her crib. 11 30 dream feed 2 00 awake, nurse, right back to sleep 4 00 awake, nurse, right back to sleep 7 00 awake, nurse, right back to sleep. 8 30 awake for day. just writing that out made me realize why i'm so tired all the time! the pediatrician told me to start letting her cio for the 2 and 4 feeds. the first night it worked great and she was back to sleep in less than 10 mins each time and slept for a few hours in between. the past two nights she cries longer and if she falls back asleep it's for less than an hour. this makes me think she must actually be hungry? also worth mentioning -she usually only eats for 5 mins at a time during day -we've done a lot of cosleeping, and holding her for naps -usually by the 4 feed she won't go back to sleep in her crib and i end up bringing her into bed any ideas???

advice on mother-led breastfeeding weaning and side effects	i'm beginning to wean my 11 month old from breastfeeding, starting with weaning my pumping sessions. i've found it very difficult to find information on mother-led weaning and am looking for some support. . how did you do it? how long did it take? did you feel any side effects? how long did they last? i know every experience is different, but any guidance or thought would be so helpful. my current plan is to drop a pumping session each week for the next few weeks until i am no longer pumping, just nursing my daughter at morning and night, which i will continue until she's a year and then wean those sessions. i started on monday. that night i had engorgement and some leaking, but that was no surprise. i've been having headaches all week and yesterday i just started to feel absolutely exhausted. i was aching all over and i'm feeling a bit emotional - this has continued into today. i'm guessing these are hormonal effects - but i can't find good information anywhere to confirm. i truly can't tell if i'm getting sick or these are side effects of the weaning. for background, during the week, my daughter nurses 2-3 times and i was pumping 3 times a day - i dropped it to 2 pumping sessions/day this week. on weekends, she was exclusively nursed, but we'll add in a bottle this weekend to make up for the pumping session i've dropped. i also supplement w/formula during the week because i can't pump quite enough for what her doc recommended. any tips? thoughts? encouragement?

can anyone tell me what is considered routine prenatal care ?	edit 2 thank you for all the helpful advice everyone! i knew i could count on you guys to help me figure it out. i'll be talking to my ob's billing department this week and i will get this all sorted out xpost from r/beyondthebump and r/mommit edit in the us i am struggling with my medical insurance company. my plan says that routine prenatal care is covered 100% but does not spell out what is considered routine. apparently the first ultrasound, most of the blood tests, and who knows what else are not 'routine'. i called the insurance company to ask for a detailed list and was told that they couldn't give me that but that i could google it by searching for what is covered under the affordable care act. it is a private medical insurance company that is offered by my husband's employer, not purchased off a health care exchange if that matters. they wouldn't tell me what was on the list in front of them? wtf?! so i googled and found more vagueness. a well-woman visit includes specific tests and procedures as well as topics for counseling and guidance sauce how do i narrow this down? how do i know what specific procedures are covered and not? how do i know which blood tests they're allowed to run and not? they are going to need to screen me for hypertension after today. i don't know what i am doing and i'm having a tough time. any advice? the plan document 	charl13daunicorn	/r/Mommit/comments/6n50km/can_anyone_tell_me_what_is_considered_routine/	16	20	0	0.93	1499984497.0

i'm still not 100% sure where i can bring my baby and where i can't	i have an 8 1/2 month old and i'm still not completely sure when it's socially acceptable to bring my son along and when it's not. i tried asking my mom and she said oh, just bring him with, everyone does it! . i can understand if it's just a general checkup, but is it really okay to bring him someplace like the gynecologist or a therapist? what about specific types of restaurants? once, i took him to a sports bar that had family seating and in the middle of the meal i started to feel like i shouldn't have had him there. i need a clear cut list of where i can bring him along and where i probably shouldn't, haha. if it makes a difference, he is a super easy going baby and has only had two crying fits in public ever.	lavastoviglie	/r/Mommit/comments/6nyixx/im_still_not_100_sure_where_i_can_bring_my_baby/	34	36	0	0.94	1500352270.0
how do you full-time working moms find/make the time to exercise?	my daily schedule has me up at 6, leaving for daycare/work by 7 30, work an office job until 5 15ish, home by 6, feed lo, play and lo goes to bed between 7 45-9. lo is 13 months, not walking, husband leaves for work between 6 30-7 and gets home before i do. i have an apple watch that keeps me pretty accountable. i've walked at lunch, but it's over 90 degrees with crazy humidity in the south and i can't go back to work smelly and sweaty. i walk lo and the dog after work in the heat, but i'm barely getting 10,000 steps in daily and then i feel like i'm just torturing lo. i have committed to changing the diet now that i'm in my mid-30s. i try to eat as close to whole 30 as i can and have been for the last 3-4 weeks, so now i think its time to step up the activity level. i'm pretty overweight and not a runner, so something more low impact because every time i've jumped into exercise too gung-ho in i've hurt myself and it backfires! any tips and best practices from working moms out there would be appreciated! edit, and don't say couch to 5k, i've tried it twice, and when i say i'm not a runner, i mean it! i'm inept 	MSWMBASWP	/r/Mommit/comments/6o0oox/how_do_you_fulltime_working_moms_findmake_the/	43	26	0	0.9	1500383755.0
need advice, what carrier is best for a bad back?	as much as i enjoy pushing strollers, i cannot carry a car seat with my back. so wearing is my best option. i need something that distributes the weight evenly. i tried an ergo when i was babysitting a 3 month old and my back and ribs killed me for 2 days! was it just from jumping straight to a 13 lb baby? i feel like all the pressure was sandwiched between my ribs and back. it was awful. i was thinking of a moby since it covers so much of the body, or a ring sling since it spreads out the strap more. what works for you guys?		/r/Mommit/comments/6oe6jh/need_advice_what_carrier_is_best_for_a_bad_back/	6	5	0	1.0	1500527624.0
how upset should i be?	i got a call from daycare today. my 1yo got bit by another kid. twice. she had only been there just over an hour. it sounds like it was the same kid, and they were separated after the first bite, but apparently not separated enough. my first instinct was to run get her, but i talked myself down. my husband is pissed. i kinda feel like it's a hazard of being a toddler, but... twice. how much roughness should i expect in the toddler room? the incident reports started coming in when she started crawling and climbing but we have never had one before that was actual aggression toward my baby.	sillyribbit	/r/Mommit/comments/6or343/how_upset_should_i_be/	3	7	0	1.0	1500673422.0
ftm of a 6-week old. how can i lose the weight?	i gained 45 lbs during my pregnancy. i've always been petite and now i'm having a hard time with my extra bit of weight that's still on. i'm not pumping not breastfeeding, so those options to cut calories are out. i'm not snacking or eating anything crazy...although i'm enjoying 2 cups of caffinated coffee a day which wasn't a typical routine of mine pre-pregnancy or while i was pregnant. i don't have time for much , but want to feel like i'm contributing to my weight loss. i have about 15 lbs until my pre-pregnancy weight. hopefully i'm being realistic that this is even a possibility!	littlebigcoffee	/r/Mommit/comments/6p5muz/ftm_of_a_6week_old_how_can_i_lose_the_weight/	8	2	0	1.0	1500863748.0
how can i support friend?	one of my husband and i's best friends found out today that his son is not his. he is such an amazing father. and his son loves him sooo much. his son is 2.5 years old. our friend had growing suspicions and finally did a dna test. results came back 0% paternal match. my heart breaks for him. he is grieving as though he lost his child, and in a way he did. the love for this living child is still in his heart, but he is not sure if he can continue on as the child's father. we have a child the same age as his son, and they are close and we see him often. i can't sleep thinking about this situation, and what my friend is going through. has anyone been through a similar experience? how can we be supportive for him? whether he decides to continue on or step away...	driiiipy_sink	/r/Mommit/comments/6petse/how_can_i_support_friend/	3	14	0	1.0	1500971082.0
discipline advice needed.	so long story and i'm on mobile, so it won't be as full as it could be. a little background my sd10 is extremely irresponsible, mean, and manipulative to my so/ her dad. so discipline is either nothing or he bottles it all and they just scream at each other and then nothing comes of it anyway. we also have three other kiddos, one is my son is six, and only knows my so as his dad, though he isn't bd, and our two littles. my son gets disciplined for every little thing, because my so says he wants him to be a good adult. we don't spank or anything, we practice imperfect attachment parenting. now for the needed advice. yesterday, my sd10and bs6 we're taking a shower in my big master shower while i did some school work in my room. i look out of the corner of my eye and see water. thinking the nozzle was just facing the shower door, i go open the door and check. my sd is holding the removable shower nozzle and barely any water is coming out, but my toilet room is flooded and the bathroom floor is starting to. i quickly turn it off and realize the pipes burst and were filling my walls with water, which was leaking into the toilet room. i asked if anything happened, they both said no idea plumber gets there a few hours later and tells me the shower nozzle was completely busted from the pipe in the wall, meaning someone really put force on the nozzle. so i reask my sd if she pulled on the nozzle. she says no. i ask how she reached it as it's extremely high on the wall. she gave some lame, made up way of climbing up the wall. i called her lie and told her i was disappointed and we'd discuss it when her dad got home. so, $300 later our pipes our fixed, but now we have to pay $1000 to have someone come fix our walls and ensure it's properly dried out so we don't get mold, not to mention buy an entire new shower head as she broke this too. my so talked to them, and wants to set a harsher punishment. he wants to include my bs because he should have told on her, even though my so punishes him for tattling, but he has agreed sd needs a harsher punishment. so, i'm at a loss. she goes back to her bm in like three weeks. she never does her chores and has earned nearly nothing all summer. she has no saved money cause she blows it all. so i suggested adding chores and not paying her allowance until it's at least half paid off. but that isn't really realistic as she leaves soon and doesn't do her chores to earn anything anyway. i've worked so hard to help raise her since i met her, just to be able to stand, as his entire family and everyone we meet can't stand being around her, and though it's a work in progress, we've made some progress. but this has to stop. we can't afford her being so reckless and careless. and she's rubbing off on my younger kids as they look up to her. what can we do to show her this is serious?	josapheen_belle	/r/Mommit/comments/6pgwxg/discipline_advice_needed/	4	19	0	0.91	1500996957.0
advice for 2 year old at school.	help me feel better; our sweet lo is going to be 2 next month. we recently enrolled her in a montessori school for a summer program and a fall program. she goes 2 days a week from 8 30-12 30pm. it's her 5th time being there. she loved it there in the beginning. the orientation she had a blast and on her first day of school she also had a blast. then the second time and beyond she started crying when she went into class. she would cry for me off and on throughout the day. each day she goes its harder for her. today she said on the way to school dont want to. the teachers called me from the school each day and say she cries so hard she falls asleep and wont eat. today they went as far as saying i may have to get her early! ive tried many things so far; telling her i will be back, she is safe, distraction. i have worked with the teachers who try to help the situation as well. i dont even linger. just looking to see what else to do. this makes me so sad and frustrated. the teachers keep saying she needs more time. can anyone chime in? thanks! i just want to say - she is doing much much better!! she only cried for 2 mins the last two times at drop off and she is happy when i pick her up 	MsKetoQueen	/r/Mommit/comments/6ph27d/advice_for_2_year_old_at_school/	22	33	0	1.0	1500998240.0
new to this sub and i have a question...	hi everyone! not sure if this query is for this subreddit, but here goes... so ever since my daughter was born i have struggled with my weight and body condition. i tussled with alcohol for a while to cope but i've been sober for 57 days. i've already seen positive changes and i've been going to the gym 3 to 5 times a week for an hour each time. my biggest embarrassment is my lower stomach, the skin seems so loose even if i've lost a couple of pounds. i had a slight pooch before pregnancy, but now it's just gross. i hate being naked and i want to change it. so after all of that, i would like to ask you ladies, if there is anything you recommend? i've tried a lot of creams and lotions both organic and not. i do a lot of ab work at the gym. but none of it seems to help. thank you all for your time! if this should be asked on a other sub please let me know.	paintedlion	/r/Mommit/comments/6pjtsh/new_to_this_sub_and_i_have_a_question/	6	7	0	0.82	1501022328.0
how do you approach political discussion with your kid?	let's avoid specifics of your views, but how do you plan to raise your kid with regards to conversation and action about your political views? do you plan to say nothing? inform them on your views but not your party? take them to political events? etc etc your cultural/ upbringing background would help too for context. we have 2 kiddos and have thought a lot about how to avoid indoctrination while also teaching the values we believe in. it's tougher than we thought-- i.e. something like global warming is somehow political, so where do we draw the line on what to talk about in front of our kids? sorry if this post irritates people who are tired of politics but i feel parents are in this awkward spot more than ever!	ihave2kittens	/r/Mommit/comments/6pl3bd/how_do_you_approach_political_discussion_with/	5	3	0	1.0	1501035711.0
need to start the process of weaning 20mo old from comfort nursing at night, but i'm scared to do it. any advice appreciated!	i started reading the no cry sleep solution but i'm feeling overwhelmed at starting. the reasons are many my husband and i still live in an apartment so we're always conscious of her crying loudly at night. plus i don't believe in the cio method at all. my 20 month old is really stubborn and vocal. i'm also sensitive and can't bear it when she cries out for me or acts like i'm rejecting her. we also cosleep. that combo has prevented me from starting sooner. if you coslept and still nursed at night...how did you finally break the routine and get your baby to sleep without needing you? were you able to do it without traumatizing them? or do they get over it fast. i could use any advice from you moms who went through it! i'm a nervous first time mom that doesn't feel very courageous at the moment...	coffeeposer	/r/Mommit/comments/6ptpde/need_to_start_the_process_of_weaning_20mo_old/	23	22	0	0.92	1501130657.0

advice for bringing my 3yr old to a house on a lake	i'm bringing my 3yr old to my moms lake house in a week. i've been researching water-activated wrist bands, just for some peace of mind, but at $140 with mediocre reviews...it doesn't seem like a great idea. additionally, the shoreline is 100s of feet and most wrist bands don't reach that far. obviously supervision is the only way. i'm most worried about night time. at home, my daughter slips out of bed and wanders, unlocking outside doors. we've caught her on her swing set outside in the wee hours of the day. i have bells on all my doors now. yes, she carries chairs to step on and unchain door chains. she's quiet and persistent and unafraid of the dark. any tips of tricks from you ladies to keep her safe, would be appreciated!! update door handles all look like this!	distastefulconfusing	/r/Mommit/comments/6r1l1n/advice_for_bringing_my_3yr_old_to_a_house_on_a/	18	21	0	1.0	1501645315.0

i hate my post baby body. how can i lose weight fast?	i don't post much but when baby was first born this subreddit really helped me get through the tough first months. anyways my son is 5 months old now , i am a first time mom and in my mid 20's. before my son i was always very insecure about my weight, it has always defined how i see myself. it has always fluctuated up and down however right before i got pregnant i was at an ideal weight. after years of hating my body i started to accept my body and love myself. after baby i developed a bad sugar habit for comfort. whenever my husband came home i gave him the baby and had a sugary snack to comfort myself, it felt good. it was a reward for making it through the day, that's how i justified it in my head. in the middle of the night after i fed baby and put him down, i would go to the kitchen, get 3 or 4 sugary snacks and eat. again i would justify it as a reward and it would keep my awake for another 30 mins in case baby wakes up again. i had a lot of excuses at first, now i gained a lot of my old weight back plus saggy skin on my belly from the baby and stretch marks. i feel worse now than ever. i can't look at myself in the mirror. i have no full body pictures of me and my son because i can't stand to look at them. i don't even look at myself when i undress to shower. my problem is sugar. i have an intense addiction to sugary snacks. when i cut back, my appetite feels insatiable , like nothing i eat will make me feel full unless it's sugar. i've read that this is part of the sugar cravings cycle, i'm not sure if that's true. i know i have done this to myself. i need to discipline and control my cravings. have other women felt this way about their bodies after baby? how can i stop the cravings and hunger? any advice, remedies, would help. thank you moms! you are all such wonderful women which is why i'm coming to you for help.	quasimodosbell	/r/Mommit/comments/6rz9nx/i_hate_my_post_baby_body_how_can_i_lose_weight/	27	5	0	0.77	1502036752.0

7 month old too big for sleep sack. what do i put him in to sleep?	 i need advice from parents of babies ! after we transitioned my son out of swaddling we put him in the magic merlin sleep suit. it's purpose was to give him freedom to move his arms/legs but with the comfy secure feeling of a swaddle. it also kept him from rolling. he's outgrown it and we were putting him in a sleep sack. the problem is that he really likes to sleep on his stomach now but seems to have a hard time rolling back onto his back when he's in the sleep sack . it might be because he doesn't have enough freedom to use his legs when rolling since he's almost too big for the sleep sack . he rolls in both directions just fine when he's on the floor. so i was thinking maybe we just put him in pajamas and that's it? but will he be warm enough?? . i ran out today to buy a pair of fleece pajamas in his size since all his other ones are more cotton and lightweight. help!

my kid won't sleep on his own and i have no idea what to do	my son is almost 20 months old, he is strong willed but super affectionate and is a total mammas boy. here recently he has been waking more frequently and earlier in the night after being put down to bed. the only time he will sleep fully during the night is if i let him sleep with me but i really want him to sleep on his own. i've tried damn near everything i can think of to remedy the situation but nothing works. he has a very regular bedtime and routine and he almost never fights it initially when i put him to bed. it's really cutting into the only time i really get to spend with my husband one on one since he works 3rd shift and he is starting to get understandably frustrated and angry at our kid and i'm just exhausted by all of it. so here's a little rundown of what a night looks like for us 6 30pm-7 15 dinner time 7 15-7 45 play time/story time 7 45-8 diaper change, put on jam jams, brush teeth, night night kisses 8pm bedtime 9pm logan wakes up 9 15 pm pick him up and get him to give daddy another night night kiss then back to bed 9 45 logan wakes up 10pm repeat 9 15 step 10 30 husband goes to work 11 logan wakes up again 11 15 let him cry it out with no avail 11 45 hold him until he falls asleep and put him back to bed 12 15 logan wakes up i give up and let him sleep with me. i've tried cry it out, but every single time he is so strong willed that he will cry for hours i clocked him at 2.5 hours at the longest stretch and that was on a good night. we tried to keep it reasonable but that just made things worse and i am just not emotionally capable of handling that on my own on nights when my husband is working. i've tried the super nanny thing where you comfort first then, become blunt the next time, then every time after that point you just ignore it. it hated that method and felt like it left us in a worse spot than just the cry it out because he got confused by why i stopped showing up. i've tried cutting out naps, i've tried no drinks after 6, i've tried switching up his white noise sounds, i've tried cooling the room, i've tried warming the room, i've tried a comforting toy and even went as far as putting one of my shirts on his favorite pillow so it smells like me and nothing has worked. his pediatrician recommended for my sake to give home some melatonin or benadryl to get him to sleep when i am at an absolute low point and even that didn't work! she even said that he isn't exhibiting anything out of the ordinary and it will pass in time, which i call bullshit. i'm on my last leg here and i'm not sure what to do. my marriage is absolutely suffering because of this, my mental health is struggling and i'm beginning to feel like i am a failure as a mom. please help me! tl;dr my kid not sleeping is ruining my sex life, hurting my marriage and my mental health, and i'm not sure how to deal. please send help or reassurance!	savannahwithnoh	/r/Mommit/comments/6tniqu/my_kid_wont_sleep_on_his_own_and_i_have_no_idea/	39	38	0	0.97	1502727855.0

at what age did your kid stop squirming all over the bed?	my son is nearly two and we transitioned him to a twin mattress on the floor about a month ago. he's been doing great with it, but most days he ends up on the floor after only an hour or two because he flails, wiggles and moves so much. we tried a bed rail with no success. he seems comfortable no matter where he ends up so i'm not that worried about it, but i'm curious when to expect this bed exploration to end? he was always a very active sleeper while in his crib, as well.	randomtrend	/r/Mommit/comments/6tzjjp/at_what_age_did_your_kids_stop_squirming_all_over/	3	7	0	0.83	1502855631.0
what would you do?	my son, who is 3, going on four had been in daycare for almost a year now. at first, things seemed fine. a couple months ago he started not wanting to go, and throwing fits. i brushed it off as him being three . then last month, a huge bruise showed up on the back of his calf. i asked his daycare what happened, she didn't know. now he's coming home telling me that the woman who runs the daycare, her fiance is yelling at the kids. i work for an attorney and see horrible things happening to kids everyday. i feel terrible thinking something is happening. i have him on a waiting list for a,daycare/ preschool so i'm hoping he will be there within a few weeks. i'm just at a loss, i don't know if i'm overreacting, but i'm very upset by all of this.	inkitupandpierceit	/r/Mommit/comments/6u1p54/what_would_you_do/	36	30	0	0.94	1502886601.0
new to r/mommit; intro and a question about whining!	hey guys! i'm new to this subreddit, my first just turned 1, so i'm moving from the baby subs to start learning about the wonderful/awful phase that is toddlerdom. my daughter is pretty independent, can play on her own in the playpen for an hour without incident. but every now and then, she gets sooooo whiney! how do you guys handle that? example she's playing with the mega blocks table, wants to remove one of the pieces and can't right away, so she whines. or she's pulling on the belt loop on my dress right now, and it isn't coming off , so she whines. how do you guys manage that? i've tried saying no whining when she does it, but how do i get her to understand what i'm saying? i'm so worried i'm going to raise a needy brat. she listens to my husband but not me. and i think it's because i don't have as stern a voice as him . halp plz!		/r/Mommit/comments/6wg94q/new_to_rmommit_intro_and_a_question_about_whining/	4	4	0	0.71	1503884090.0

struggling at dinner with a 2 year old	so i'm a mom of two. i have a 2 year old and an 11 month old. my youngest loves to eat. lives to eat. will eat anything food or not, if i don't watch him. my 2 year old...not so much. since he turned one, he's been an off and on eater. at first, i thought this was just him regulating himself. i wasn't going to push it, but he's been borderline on his weight his whole life, and it's gotten to the point where he will refuse to eat whole meals. i don't want to get into his whole life story, but i've googled and tried nearly everything on picky toddlers, and some stuff will work temporarily, some stuff not at all. now for my question. i'm putting together a grocery list for meals this week and i'm wondering if there's any reasonable food/meals out there that toddlers in general will eat. right now, i've narrowed his favorites to waffles, mandarin oranges, hot dogs and pbj's . obviously i can't feed him those things for dinner every night. do you guys have any ideas for meal planning purposes on what kind of stuff is toddler friendly?

toddler didn't want to come home	my husband and i went away for the first weekend alone since our daughter was born in may 2015. she stayed with her aunt and older cousin whom she loves. i was do excited to come home and see her and as soon as she saw me she started crying that she didn't want to come home. she only let her aunt pick her up. i'm trying to rationalize it but it really broke my heart. i must not be doing a very good job as a mother. i do work part time and my daughter can be very difficult some days. some times i lose my patience and i have to leave the room when she screams but i never yell or hit. although sometimes i do have to physically wrestle her in to her car seat so i can maje it to work which makes us both really sad. i can't sleep because i'm thinking about everything i've done wrong and how i can be a better mother. i'd like to hear any advice you have to give. thanks.

sahms, do you earn any kind of income? if so, what do you do? 	i know this topic gets posted a lot, but i need help. some back story first; due to family drama, we aren't going to have childcare for our son anymore . my husband and i are in that awkward situation where we don't make enough money to pay for daycare, but we make too much to qualify for any kind of assistance. hopefully, his job prospects will improve in the coming months and i'll be able to quit working no problem , but in the meantime, i need to somehow bring home some money while staying home with our son, or at least do something where he can tag along. i need to make up at least $800 a month, which sounds to me like so much to make working from home. i also know that a lot of work from home jobs are not feasible unless you have some kind of childcare anyway. i've considered making things, but it takes a lot of time to build up a successful etsy business, and i just don't have that right now. i'm wracking my brain for anything i can think of, but i just can't think of anything! my background i currently work in finance, and have over 5 years of experience with that. along with normal banking stuff, i also have significant skills in microsoft office, but not much else outside of customer service. any suggestions are welcome!	jhonotan1	/r/Mommit/comments/75zcuj/sahms_do_you_earn_any_kind_of_income_if_so_what/	46	59	0	0.94	1507836482.0
how does your toddler spend their day?	hello all! i am a stay at home mom to a 13 month old and i am just curious what others in this situation do during the day? i have seen example schedules but they usually just focus on sleeping and eating times. i am more curious about how much time do you spend actively playing with your toddler? how much time do they spend playing independently while you get things done? how much housework do you regularly get done while they are awake? do you involve them in the housework you do or do you leave them in a playspace to play independently? how often do you get out of the house? when you get out of the house is it usually for errands or for toddler-geared activities? this is my first child and i am just curious how i can approach our days better and what i maybe could do differently. currently, i don't feel like i am able to get much done during the day aside from feeding and entertaining my little guy but i don't know if that is normal or not. i don't have many friends and even fewer who are moms and my mom doesn't remember many of the specifics of having a toddler in the house. thanks in advance and if there are any resources that y'all can recommend as well i am open to all suggestions.	mamahasnoclue	/r/Mommit/comments/760359/how_does_your_toddler_spend_their_day/	11	19	0	0.93	1507842962.0
need advice for my clingy toddler	please excuse any grammatical errors as i type over my mobile after half a bottle of wine. please note, i ask for this advice out of love and my desire for my son to develop into a mature, independent man one day. so as the title suggests my 2 yr old son is a stage 4 clinger. he wakes up saying how much he loves me, insists i hold him whenever we are out, and choses me over peers. while i want to keep his declarations of love, i also want him to go off with new friends, under supervised conditions of course, and let me put him down without a supreme meltdown. is this just the typical 2 yr old experience or is there something i can do to help him seek his independence? he is my first child and i was always the youngest child in every group growing up, so i don't have any child experience outside of him. any person i ask in my family encourages the dependence as he has a history of getting gravely ill, but after some great medicine/treatment those days may be behind us . i want him to progress like he hasn't had any setbacks so one day everybody can forget his past. at a party recently, i tried leaving him at a playground with a couple he knows well while i unloaded my car. i informed him first and he seemed okay with it, but by the time i got to my car his meltdown was so bad he never let me put him down for the reminder of day when i returned.		/r/Mommit/comments/76fc1x/need_advice_for_my_clingy_toddler/	4	5	0	0.86	1508021286.0
how to handle guests and pictures with baby	tw discussion of sa advocacy and csa i'm staunchly in the no-pictures-on-social-media camp. tbh, i'm still not comfortable with emailing or texting pictures. it's a combination of wanting my kid to have as much control over what he shares as possible; concern over facial recognition especially of minors; and my former career as a rape victim advocate, which leaves me well versed in how pedophiles can use the internet. we're finally getting around to introducing our friends to our baby / our baby to our friends, most of whom don't have kids of their own. i know i'm in the minority for the group in both motherhood and social media approach, as most don't think twice about what's shared. in a previous, pre-baby visit one of the guests who will be coming livestreamed my husband onto social media without his permission. another time a family member took video of me very pregnant after i asked her not to take any pictures of me. both happened without our knowledge and early into visits. we haven't seen much of these folks in a while, after a tumultuous pregnancy and move to a new town. i don't want to undercut the joy of the events with a repetitive stern warning upon greeting, but also would like to avoid pictures in general. because honestly nobody really needs pictures of my baby. if you have a similar no-pictures preference or philosophy, how do you enforce it? i know i'm not going to have this level of control forever, but i'd like to minimize as much as possible. do people have no picture households? do i come up with an elevator pitch style quote to share every time someone breaks out their phone? i'm not one to put adults' feelings before kids' safety and security, but it's still just so awkward all around.		/r/Mommit/comments/76mz27/how_to_handle_guests_and_pictures_with_baby/	20	13	0	0.84	1508114685.0

a new mom needs advice on sleeping... please	this is my first time posting here and im so desperate for advice! i have a five month old that i am trying to transition from his rock n play to his crib. we tried to do this two months ago and it was unsuccessful and well.. we were exhausted and not ready to take the plunge. today we were ready to start the transition and began this morning with his naps. he is still swaddled and his legs were going crazy in the crib.. flopping up and down and eventually it caused him to wake up after thirty minutes during each nap. i assume because hes so used to his legs being tucked underneath him in the rock n play. does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do to stop this? we tried the merlin sleep suit a few months ago and he had the same problem with the leg kicking. i also currently have his mattress at an incline. do i just stick it out and let him wake up multiple times a night till he gets used to it? will he eventually get used to it? sorry for the rambling.. just an exhausted and new mommy here. thanks so much!	cutemama	/r/Mommit/comments/78kb6t/a_new_mom_needs_advice_on_sleeping_please/	5	2	0	1.0	1508893355.0

my son lied to me about his injury - advice?	i want to start off by saying that my son is probably the sweetest, most adorable boy i've ever known. everyone who meets him adores him, he's just naturally charming. he's well-liked amongst his friends and he's always been a class-clown type. not that he doesn't get into trouble, but he usually apologizes really quickly and takes his punishments on the chin. anyway, a few days ago he came home with a bruise on his cheek. i got concerned and asked him what had happened, but he just said he'd bumped into a doorway. he was acting a little fidgety and i pressed him further, but he didn't change his story. i gave him some ice to put on the wound and he seemed to be doing better later. however, later i was talking to his older brother and apparently he saw what really happened. my son apparently made a cruel joke to another boy whose sibling is afflicted with cancer. as a result the boy slapped my son very, very hard across the face, bad enough to leave a bruise. i was a little upset upon hearing this and went to my son to talk about it. he squirmed and tried to deny it a few more times, and then finally he admitted it and said the joke had just slipped out of his mouth - it was just a nasty, dark joke he'd heard from another friend and he didn't really mean it. my older son also said, to be fair, that my younger son got teary-eyed and apologized profusely as soon as the other kid hit him. i think i should clarify that they've been friends in the past, and my older son said the kid ultimately accepted my son's apology. anyways, my son said the slap had really humiliated him, and that he lied to me about it because he didn't want me to think less of him for telling a joke like that. i told him that he couldn't say things like that, but i was sorry that the other kid hit him. he seemed to be placated a little but then he begged me not to tell his dad, whom he'd also told the crashing into the doorway story to. i feel like he's desperate for our approval and doesn't want to appear like a bad kid in our eyes. i was thinking my husband and i should address this with him together, but i'm not exactly sure how i should proceed. my son's pretty badly spooked and he's been really fidgety for a while. whenever i go near my husband my son hangs around me as if to make sure i don't tell him. . does anyone have any advice? i always want him to be able to be honest with me about his problems, and i worry i'm not providing an environment in which he feels comfortable enough to do that.	parentingthrowaway72	/r/Mommit/comments/7crqji/my_son_lied_to_me_about_his_injury_advice/	3	6	0	0.75	1510619582.0

anyone else feel guilty when they can't make the school/daycare extracurriculars because you're working?	my daughter's daycare is nice. they have fun themed weeks that dictate what stories they read, games they play, crafts, etc. every few weeks, they have events. they did a diwali party where the kids practiced a diwali dance, they had a pumpkin patch before halloween and had a costume parade the day of. today is a potluck . and in a few weeks there is a holiday performance. cute, right? the problem is all these events start at 4pm, and every day for a week leading up to these events, i am asked if i'm going. no. i can't leave work early every other week for all these events. my husband works nights so we get just enough time for brief play and dinner before he leaves. no, i can't make your events, chances are i never will, please stop asking because it makes me feel guilty. i could take the time off, but my daughter was sick a lot at the beginning of this year, and i used a lot of pto for our move across the country. i only have 2 days of pto left between now and the end of the year. i'm using that pto to make my christmas break longer to see my family across the country. no one is purposely making me feel bad about not attending these events, but i am getting so tired of having to explain why i'm missing another one. the one time i did leave early to go to an event for a few minutes , they all kept asking why we couldn't stay longer. it's because i want my daughter to see her dad before he leaves for work! does anyone else feel like a crappy parent for not being able to attend those events? i feel like i would make more an effort if my daughter were older, maybe? i feel like a potluck for 1-2 year olds is a bit over the top. oh ya, and a potluck? i'm a working parent, i'm lucky if we get a full dinner together, and then my husband leaves for work, and i'm alone, and you want me to make more food for an event we can't even stay for? i feel like i sound so selfish, i just hate disappointing people. edit to add yes, i realize i could just buy food from the store for the potluck, but i literally only just now realized it.		/r/Mommit/comments/7dp14n/anyone_else_feel_guilty_when_they_cant_make_the/	28	70	0	0.91	1510962635.0

i don't know what to do.	my son is 15 months old, recently he has gotten to this stage where he has been hitting, scratching, biting and pulling hair. sometimes in an act of retaliation but most of the time its like someone is holding him and hes all sweet and cuddly then all of a sudden he is clobbering their face. luckily he has not done this to strangers or to people he doesn't see much and most importantly he never hits other kids. he has cousin he sees and he is so gentle with them. its frustrating and embarrassing since i have no idea how to even begin to discipline him when he does it. we have tried for months to grab his hands when he hits and gently caress us and repeat be nice other times we have just put him down and ignore his cries to be picked up again. none of these seem to be helping and i doubt he understands the concept of time out. whats making me more upset is how my mother and my grandmother are handling it. they babysit him 3 days out of the week while hubby and i work. i get that he is hitting them and its not okay and i am unsure what to do about it. they constantly keep making comments like. your going to lose your babysitter. his scratches are going to scar me forever. your evil and i dont want to give you hugs because you will scratch me. it was really embarrassing when this was a topic of thanksgiving dinner and family members were laughing at us and basically making fun of our 1 year old son and saying no one is going to watch him anymore especiially when my family knows the free daycare is our lifeline as we just bought a new house and i started working again. this is the family that was pissed off at me for moving away in the first place to go to college and then was pissed when i first had my son and lived far from them. yes i lived in delware and they lived in pa it was an hour car ride and guess who always made the trip if my son wanted to visit with them. i can never please them and its hurtful for them to say mean things about a 1 year old who has no control over his emotions yet. i get i need to hold him accountable for his actions and get this under control. my family is making a hard situation even harder. i dont know if im looking for advice or just somewhere to vent. i never feel like anything i do is right ever. tldr; 15 month old is hitting biting and scratching my husband and i along with grandmom and great grandmom i dont know how to get him to stop and now they are making fun of him and threatening not to babysit him. i feel like i dont know who is right and who is wrong.	toxxxicbarbie	/r/Mommit/comments/7fawdw/i_dont_know_what_to_do/	18	53	0	1.0	1511562591.0

handling a toddler who is having serious difficulty adjusting to change. help!	brief backstory first daughter is almost 2.5 years old and normally goes to daycare 5 days a week. my maternity leave with second daughter is barely two weeks in. my mother is visiting for these first three weeks and so we are keeping oldest daughter home for extra special family time. so is also staying home on paternity leave for another 2 weeks. our toddler, who is generally enthusiastic but very sweet and kind has turned into enthusiastic but acting out nearly every chance she gets. i understand that this is normal since her life and home are changing and shes not very adaptable yet. i just need tips from other moms on how to handle her mood swings. she hits my so and me and then laughs in our faces when we get upset with her. . i have been reading some articles/blogs that suggest trying to remain as calm as possible since a child is likely to feed off the negative feedback but i need more help than that. please tell me if you have had success in dealing with a similar situation with your kids and how you managed to actually stay calm and not lose it in front of your child.

single moms what information do i need from the father?	hi, i am pregnant with my first child. the father will be absent from the child's life due to a variety of circumstances but we are able to civilly discuss things relating to my pregnancy, child support, etc., however, i do not plan to keep him in my life once the child has been born other than monthly support deposits which will require zero communication. so my questions is, what information should i get from him while we are still maintaining communication? i know there is not much i can do in regards to paperwork until the child is born but i want to make the best of our current cordial relationship before it is too late. recently, i have been thinking of medical history and have had to ask questions about his family history for basic appointments. what kind of questions about his medical history should i be asking to know for the future? he has a child with allergies, etc... is that important to me? is there anything you wish you would have been able to ask the bio father of your child? i am clearly freaking out a little....

why does finding childcare always fall on the mom?	so this is a rant. i want to preface it with the obligatory i love my family members and they are truly wonderful people so please don't judge them for a small complaint i have. last week, my husband text me that we were going to host our employee appreciation night on saturday. it wasn't in our calendar which is shared on our phones, so i told him that i probably couldn't find a sitter on such short notice. his response was - it'll be fine to bring the kids. then the next day he text me and told me to try and find a sitter. i tried and no luck. it was winter formal and all our normal sitters were off to dance the night away. the grandparents can't sit because they are also hosting this event and my dad wasn't an option. i knew it would be an up hill battle when i found it wouldn't start until 6 30 . when i got there with the children and my husband, i was ready. i had games and toys and brought kid friendly food to keep every one busy while the adults ate, and the first thing out of my fil's mouth was hello sjb1985, you couldn't find a sitter? queue my hurt feelings because 1 husband didn't give me enough time to find a sitter 2 ask your damn son this question and 3 no, obviously not. they are here. so why ask? i said no, and the look he gave me told me all i needed to know that as soon as the kids started acting up, i would pack them up and we would head home for the night. my husband would stay because this is his business and he should stay to appreciate his employees for all the hard work they do. when i explained, i only found out about that monday, fil stated that an invite was sent out and he asked if i checked my mail. i told him, i never got it or i would have tried to find a sitter. i was pretty much done and trying to not cry at that moment. why couldn't my husband find a goddamn sitter, and why does every one assume i, the mom, the woman, needs to find a damn sitter? ugh. i'm still very mad about this. honestly, i am not mad that we left before dinner was served. i would have rather just stayed home, but seriously? anyone who thinks that finding quality care on a short notice is so easy can spend a week with me trying to find a good sitter. i swear. i'm like rage mad thinking about this!

why does my insurance want my boy's medicaid info?	hi mommit, i hope this is ok to ask here. i thought you all might have some answers since you might have encountered the same questions. i am on mobile so apologies for formatting etc. a few months ago i made a post about being frustrated with the way my insurance covered prenatal care. well, i'm postnatal now with a micro preemie who has been in the hospital since august. he has had heart surgery and was on ecmo life support at one point. in the eyes of my insurance company i have a million dollar baby. with a month in the hospital before he was born, 2 er visits and a week in the hospital later on for c-diff, i wasn't cheap either. so we hit our out-of-pocket max with the healthcare insurance company. awesome. thing is he also has medicaid, because he is a micro preemie. my basic understanding is that medicaid covers any bills of his that his insurance doesn't, so like a secondary insurance. so the way i see it, our insurance has no need to know or interact with his medicaid. our insurance is calling trying to get my son's medicaid info and i'm afraid they are going to try and flip it so they are secondary, or consider what medicaid picked up no longer out of pocket. so, to the question why would our insurance want his medicaid and what are they going to do with it? any help is welcome. i'm going to cross-post this everywhere i can think of.	charl13daunicorn	/r/Mommit/comments/7jlb8c/why_does_my_insurance_want_my_boys_medicaid_info/	3	4	0	0.84	1513190452.0

starting 6 month old on solids. what works best to get him to eat it?	we decided to start with baby food instead of going the cereal route. i don't think there's any nutritional value in cereal and our dr said it's perfectly fine to go straight to baby food. what are some methods you've used to get your little one to eat the baby food? i put it on a spoon and try to just get it in his mouth. sometimes i may be a little more forceful than gentle, but i don't really mean to be. maybe it's more invasive than forceful? i don't know, but i figure if i can just get him to taste it, he'll start to want it right? if he doesn't eat it, he'll never know what he's missing. i don't know what i'm doing really so any advice is appreciated. all i can get out of my siblings who are parents is that it takes time. no advice other than just get the food in the mouth. thank you in advance! update - my kid hates food. hates it. the minute we get his food out, he starts fussing. if the spoon gets anywhere near his face, he freaks out and starts flailing his arms around. this flings the food all over. i don't know what to do. i get really frustrated anytime i try which i know isn't good. hubby tries too and gets mostly the same results. he seems to be better at it then i am. daycare doesn't have luck either. any other ideas?	moonbug444	/r/Mommit/comments/7khcwc/starting_6_month_old_on_solids_what_works_best_to/	25	8	0	0.91	1513554273.0
how did you start supplementing?	good morning reddit mamas! i will be away from baby for about 10 days. i have 70 oz of ebm, but that will not be enough. my husband and i were thinking we try a bottle of formula before bed so i could pump. my ultimate goal is to try and get 150 oz so we could do half and half while grandma and grandpa are taking care of the little one. this will allow me time to build up somewhat more of a freezer stash while also ensuring that there aren't any gi problems. i am open to suggestions, and i am really hoping he takes to the boob when we return... we'll see. please let me know how you introduced formula, mamas of reddit. for reference, he has bottles of ebm at daycare while i am at work. he has had formula before i'd feed him for 10-15 minutes then he'd get a top off of formula. we plan to start with that same formula. he will be almost 8 months. yes, i am pumping while i am away. i didn't start earlier because we didn't have childcare so baby was coming with... now baby is staying with grandma and grandpa! thank you!

how do you get your self care time in the morning?	ive been running into a dilemma recently, mommas. my daughter is 18 months and she is into everything... which is really affecting my ability to do the basic self-care in the morning like washing my face, brushing my teeth, god forbid showering or blow drying my hair. the last time i took a shower with her locked in the bathroom with me, she ignored the box of toys we keep in the bathroom and instead, broke into the drawer where i keep my tampons and threw tampons all over the bathroom before screaming at me and banging on the glass shower door. now, mommas, i try to be zen about it and use soft voice to say im almost done and ill be just a minute and i sing songs and recite books, but yall i am tired and i just want to shower. so here is my question what works/worked for you at this age? did you get up early before your kid? did you only shower when your so could watch them? did you toddler proof-the bathroom and just let them scream? ive honestly thought about buying a second set of all of my toiletries to have downstairs so i can use them in the kitchen while she eats breakfast. im just so tired of this and i would so appreciate some new strategies to try 	moxieenplace	/r/Mommit/comments/7m9165/how_do_you_get_your_self_care_time_in_the_morning/	61	40	0	0.97	1514309506.0

help me get my 3yo to sleep!	please, i need all the help i can get right now! the past several weeks it has taken anywhere from 2-3 hours from the start of bedtime routine to her actually being asleep. we usually start around 7 30 with a bath, then quiet play time in her room, read a few books, and then rocking. this usually takes about an hour in total. lately though, she has been getting up every 5 to 15 minutes for normal toddler things like i have to potty , i need water , i need you to tuck me in . this lasts anywhere from 1-2 hours on its own. it's 10 30 right now and dh is in with her this round, we started bath 3 hours ago! another issue is that she has been crawling into bed with us every night somewhere between 2 and 4am. this is a little harder to address because she is like a ninja and is just in bed when we wake up in the morning, she doesn't usually wake us when crawling in. but with baby 2 only a few months away, this needs to stop as well. mainly because as i get rounder, i need more space. ok moms...help me with your sage wisdom on improving our bedtime routine to get this insomnia kid to stay in bed!	snappysquirrel	/r/Mommit/comments/7njtxt/help_me_get_my_3yo_to_sleep/	7	4	0	1.0	1514863834.0

young mom requesting advice	hey all im a 19 year old, and im due by the first of march with my baby girl. im so excited for her arrival and to become a mother- but im anxious as well. i feel like because i am so young- my dad and my stepmother will try to tell me what i should do and boss me around with their expectations of how i should raise my little girl. this feeling is intensified by the fact that i still live with my dad... my step mother lives in asheville and comes down every weekend to visit me and dad. my stepmother has in the past, screamed and made vague threats such as you have no idea how bad i wanted to slap you today - so my relationship with her is very intense. she has already invited herself to the birth, and because i am such a timid person and scared to say anything out of fear that she will say im a disrespectful brat, i let it slide. at this point i just want me and my lovely boyfriend in the birthing room so that neither my dad or step mother has even a chance to ruin this day for me and baby. my ultimate questions for you guys are 1. how can i set boundaries in place and be respected as a parent? 2. am i wrong for not wanting my baby to have a very close relationship with my stepmom because of the outburst and vague threats of violence towards me when i was in my second trimester? 3. should i attempt to save and move out asap to just avoid this issue all together?! i feel like because i am so dependent on my dads help that he and my step mother will try to tell me what to do with baby girl and when i tell them to stop, they will ultimately withdraw their support. i would be okay if they did because mil has offered for me to move in with her and my boyfriend if i needed to. shes been very sweet and supportive of the pregnancy but i also know mils tend to overstep their boundaries when babies are in the picture, so that is a concern of mine as well. if you read this far, thank you edit if you see through my post history you can get some deets about how my step mother is. edit2 thank you all so much for the advice! i told my dad i didnt want stepmom there and he said i need to let go of the past. looks like im probably just gonna have no one but my boyfriend and im perfectly fine with that.		/r/Mommit/comments/7nr7sb/young_mom_requesting_advice/	33	33	0	0.85	1514943339.0

breastfeeding coming to a close... advice?	i'm most likely going to stop breastfeeding my 1.5 year old, like today. he's become a bit aggressive with my breasts and i'm tired of them being used as comfort items. he recently entered a phase where he was feeding every half hour or so, for just a few minutes at a time. he wakes up 2-5 times nightly, and screams until i feed him. i know he's not hungry; it's become comfort. i'm exhausted. i've also been dealing with some physical issues because of the bfing, so there's that. the thing is, while i was never thought i'd be sentimental about this , i am sentimental about this. he's my last baby , and now that he's a bit older the connection is really quite strong. he obviously loves nursing. and i love being close to him. advice for ending this mindfully, in a way i can feel good about later on?	keepcomingupwithfunk	/r/Mommit/comments/7o39fu/breastfeeding_coming_to_a_close_advice/	29	40	0	0.98	1515075840.0

just to vent a few reasons why being a ftm makes me jealous of my husband.	im jealous of my husband and heres why...my 9mo old is possibly the worst sleeper. ever. no sleep method works. this whole not sleeping effectively for 9 months, coupled with the fact that i work an extremely demanding and stressful ft job has created a very edgy, jittery, impatient me. i know the sleep deprivation of this combined work/life hurricane is getting to me and of course my husband bears the brunt of my impatience but honestly it pisses me off how one-sided this whole caring for a child has become. diaper changes, getting ready for daycare and again in the evening, bath time, doctors appointments, drop off and pick up from daycare is all my responsibility. try as i might it's so hard not to keep score where you're this tired. and folks don't get me wrong, i have the most loving, caring husband who also works full time and has taken on some of the household chores. however it makes me super jealous that he not only sleeps 8 straight hours mostly every night, but also gets home from work before me and has the opportunity to relax with his hobbies for a good hour while i'm rushing from work to daycare before they close every damn day. and if i hear one more time that it's more realistic for me to drop off and pick up from day care because of work proximity i may just jump off a bridge. i'm jealous that his forward planning and thinking can just stop when he leaves his job --like knowing exactly what's needed to get us out the door in a timely manner and why the hell is the diaper bag is packed with a million zoobooks but no diapers. im jealous that hes not a zombie without two cups of coffee and his nipples arent constantly being attacked when trying to change clothes. i'm jealous that he's ok with relaxing during the bedtime routine while there's so much to do around the house but mostly i think i'm jealous because he became a dad and didn't seem to lose who he was or what he likes while i feel like i have completely lost myself to motherhood .

why do we make stay at home moms feel bad?	i recently told my employer that i would not be returning in september after the birth of my daughter. once word got around i started to get questions like what are you going to do all day? and dont you want to show her women can be more than housewives? its incredibly frustrating hearing all of this from coworkers family and friends. my husband and i made a decision that was right for our family. i never said my career was over i just want to take some time off to raise my daughter and be there for every moment. is that so wrong?

how do you potty train one whole the other still has to get to school?	my daughter turns 3 next month and it is probably way past time to train her. i need to get it done soon asshe is soo ready but i've got to drive her brother to and from preschool 3 times a week.. how do you balance that? also we tried to train her list year and had to stop because of some unexpected circumstances but i tried the 3 day method that i used with my son. after 5 days of that there was 0 progress. like literally. 0. she'd just stand there and pee like oh would you look at that and move on with her day like she just didn't care. half of the time it was difficult to catch her accidents because she had no reactions to them! i'm nervous this will happen again. tips?	little_lady1211	/r/Mommit/comments/7p5mqe/how_do_you_potty_train_one_whole_the_other_still/	5	1	0	1.0	1515484124.0
how old is too old to try for a second child?	i'm sorry, i've really got to ask this. but really how old is too old to try for another? most of the people i know kept telling me to have kids right after i had my first due to my age. i had my first at 27. now i'm not even 30 yet, and i've been told to either go for my second now or forget it. now my grandmother had her last child at 40. and she had 8 kids. i'm still not 100% i want another child. i do but i don't. i'm in no rush. i never thought 30/31 was too old. i actually didn't even want to try for a first until i was 30 but i gave in because i didn't think it would happen that fast. i mean is it bad being an older mom? i liked that i waited and didn't have kids too young. i feel more secure and settled at this age than say when i was 21. any older mom give me some pros and cons?

advice for a new mom??	hello moms! i'm currently 30 weeks pregnant with my first and i've been reading some posts on here about fears, worries and the likes and thought i would make a post and see if you all had any advice for me. my birth parents had my brother first and i was the surprise baby. i was told that i was the reason their divorce happened and all kind of guilt nonsense. my brother and i were both badly abused and thrown into the foster care system where we were both assaulted and abused. i know your past does not define you but i'm having serious worries about my patience levels and my abilities and trust in myself to be a mother. my fiancee is wonderful and he's supportive and i know he'll be there to help but it's just a nagging feeling in my head i'll be awful and do something awful and it's a nasty feeling.. has anyone had this issue before? how did you talk yourself down and cope? i don't like feeling like this at all. 	edgarallan2014	/r/Mommit/comments/7pt8sg/advice_for_a_new_mom/	12	12	0	0.88	1515722014.0

farting advice needed	hi all, context in the uk, baby is breastfed and sometimes has a bottle of expressed milk. problems only started about a week ago. i am struggling a little with my 9 week old during the night. during the day she is absolutely fine to nap, play, feed. however at night she keeps waking up every 1.5-2 hours and seems like she is really struggling to fart. sometimes she wakes up crying, other times she can be settled with a hand on her belly but i can feel the movements and then she farts. this has only been the case in the last week or so . before she was pooping around 5x a day, now she is going once a day and it absolutely stinks. she has no problems burping at all and often does very impressive ones after a feed. she has been having infacol for the past 3 weeks which has helped the burps. is this down to her vaccinations and so will pass or does this sound like she needs some extra help? vaccinations were 6-in-1 vaccine, given as a single jab containing vaccines to protect against six separate diseases diphtheria; tetanus; whooping cough ; polio; haemophilus influenzae type b, known as hib, a bacterial infection that can cause severe pneumonia or meningitis in young children; and hepatitis b pneumococcal vaccine rotavirus vaccine - given orally menb vaccine any and all advice appreciated! edit thank you very much for all of your help. i spoke the the health visitor and she said it's not uncommon for the vaccine to take 2 weeks to work through the system and to get back to normal, so will wait it out. fortunately she doesn't seem to be in pain when she wakes up now! unfortunately there are still a lot of wake up. fingers crossed for the next few nights	MumOfPanda	/r/Mommit/comments/7qbekr/farting_advice_needed/	17	21	0	1.0	1515929587.0
when to ditch the baby monitor?	moms of older kids, when did you ditch the baby monitor? we only have an audio monitor setup currently and baby's room shares a wall with ours, so i would still hear her biggest fusses without it. i've currently got it on the lowest volume and a fairly high sensitivity . she still doesn't sleep through the night , and i think half-asleep-me would do better at ignoring her wake-ups without the monitor. i keep going in to soothe her because listening to her cry for 10 minutes to put herself back to sleep is torture to half-asleep-me... thoughts? advice? anecdotes from your personal experience?

to those negative moms on facebook... who hurt you?	seriously... i don't dare look at the comments to a cute video or article about a celebrity parent anymore unless i feel like being bombarded with negativity. these are actual comments on videos i've seen the straps to that carseat aren't even on right! your child is going to die! you obviously don't love your child! - deb angrybottom on a video of a kid eating chicken nuggets in a parked car. ugh who cares about this person? they have money. they don't even need kids - sarah nagateeveetee on an article about some random celebrity mom saying funny tweets about parenting. that looks like vaccine injury. that baby is going to end up with autism. - janice soodosiance on a video of a baby dancing. why? what compels people to be so negative and angry on facebook? why do people always have to say something? i cannot wrap my head around it and the need to be so uptight. these people have kids, they share a common bond, and they treat others so nasty. do moms just have to be competitive, these days? hell, i've been shamed in real life for putting a bow on my little girl. . it's making for finding mom friends really difficult. just have fun with the kids, laugh about the follies and do your best. ugh. anyone else have some good negative comments they've seen on the most random videos?

does anyone else grieve for the pregnancy/child they don't want?	i have two lovely, darling, infuriating almost-9 year old twins that light up my life. and i feel like they complete my family. i don't really want more, for so many reasons. but i still find myself grieving for having no more children. it makes no sense for me to have more. i had a hard, painful pregnancy involving bedrest and premature labor. nicu stays, the whole deal. i lost a bunch of pregnancies before them. my current so is perfectly happy playing a stepparent role and doesn't feel the need to have children that share his genetics. but i still have these pangs of grief for never having a normal pregnancy. never having that nursing relationship that didn't involve premature babies and machinery. i grieve for never having that little girl or boy with his blue, blue eyes. i grieve each time my kids get older, knowing it's the last child i have that will go through that age. i always imagined having lots of kids. but on the other hand... my kids are out of diapers, and becoming independent. i'll be 43 when they graduate high school. they're amazing little people. maybe i'm just ranting. anyone feel similarly?	stillafatchick	/r/Mommit/comments/7rjljp/does_anyone_else_grieve_for_the_pregnancychild/	32	96	0	0.98	1516380309.0
how to wake up and stay awake for night feeds?	i'm half deaf so i can't actually hear the baby cry, and sleep so deeply that alarms don't wake me. so, my husband wakes me up and tells me the baby needs breastfeeding. i say i'm going to get up, but go back to sleep instead. he shakes me awake and says the baby's in his cot crying, but i bite his head off because i'm absolutely convinced that i'm breastfeeding the baby already... but i'm not. i try to apologise but by this time he's already spent 5 or 10 minutes trying to wake me up, understandably tells me to sod off, then goes and gives the baby a bottle of expressed breast milk. i then fall back alsleep again. this usually means that i miss a night time feeding which concerns me because it will contribute to a drop in milk supply. does anyone have any strategies for actually waking someone else from deep sleep?

struggling w/a circumcision decision	our first boy is circumcised, and i still feel guilt and regret about that. in hindsight, i would've put my foot down in support of protecting my son's whole body. we live in a region of the us where it is still considered common practice to do it -- our doctor touted psychosocial reasons in support of it. my husband supported having our son circumcised 100%, but i was on the fence. i ultimately went against my gut feeling that we should respect his body as his own and to leave that decision up to him when he could make his own informed choices. this morning we had our second baby boy. while my husband and i are not arguing over whether to circumcise or not, he still supports it while i'm even more against it for all the reasons that could be stated. he has expressed doubt at how our children will treat one another and how it will make them feel about having different penises. then my delivering ob also expressed concern at us possibly not having the procedure done on our second son when the first did. of course i want to prevent discord and suffering in the relationship between my boys as they grow together and, hopefully, for the most part remain good playmates and friends. i can't tell if i'd be doing the right thing sacrificing my beliefs in order to protect a harmony that hasn't yet come or will be jeopardized by regular sibling problems anyways. would it be cruel to the boys to have them be different from one another, possibly brewing jealousy among them and disrespect for their parents' decisions? would we be setting them up for problems that otherwise wouldn't be an issue? should i view this potential difference as an opportunity for all of us to learn and to teach important values and morals? is there some aspect i'm not seeing? this is ultimately my decision, and i'm feeling very torn.

please help..i'm desperate to not feel sad	hello! i think this is going to be longer than i mean it to be, but i need help! i am a sahm of an almost 4 year old and a 20 month old, both boys. they are amazing! however, i can't stop being sad about them growing up. i am so, so thankful that they are healthy and can grow up, as so many other children never get the chance to. but i look at their little faces, and i cry. i pull up younger pictures, i cry. i think about it, and the tears flow. i don't really have a reason, though. i did have ppd after my second son was born, but they upped my dose of my depression and anxiety medications, and it has changed a few times since. in general, i was ok for a while. not only is it the sadness that is controlling my life, but now i don't want to get rid of any of their baby clothes or toys because of course, i am reminded of them being little. anything else in my house, get rid of it, i hate clutter, take it. but those things, i don't want to keep them, but am too sad to give any of it away. i do see a therapist, but don't feel like i've gotten anywhere really. she thinks i feel deep regret for not being the mom i want to be, thus beating myself up, which is totally true but i feel like there's so much more i just can't put my finger on. i really like her, and she actually wants me to see one of her interns to see if they can help further. has anyone else experienced this? it's getting worse, and i just don't want to be sad. i feel like it is making me miss out on making memories because i don't want to forget the old ones. thanks so much for reading this!

when did you know it was time to stop working? 	so a little backstory, i had a horrible job, planned on quitting to go back to school and let my husband work since he recently graduated and could make decent money now. another job offer popped up for me right before our move, so i decided to stay and see how it went, it provided everything i needed financially to get out of our hole of debt we were in, was going amazing, but now 4 months in, my daughter is feeling unstable and incredibly clingy. shes 18 months and from the time i get home and even after shes asleep she has to hold onto me. its gotten to the point where she wont even sleep in her bed anymore which is out of the ordinary for her because shes always preferred to sleep alone since she was born. i feel guilty for quitting because i truly love my coworkers, but between keeping the house kept up, getting her to the babysitter every morning and working in sales full time i feel so washed out. im having chest pains, losing my hair, and have pretty constant tension headaches. i know its not healthy, i just feel guilty for leaving. not even for my coworkers, but just for the fact that i could be bringing in extra money to put in our savings, even though my husband makes more than enough to pay the bills. however i also feel like my daughters needs should be more important than our bank account. tldr; when did you know it was time to stay home, and how did you get over feeling the mom guilt like youre not contributing enough?	luiemoon	/r/Mommit/comments/7vnldg/when_did_you_know_it_was_time_to_stop_working_if/	10	7	0	0.82	1517926683.0

could use some advice regarding my kid's deadbeat dad	i'll try to make this short. it's been weighing on me for a few years now and i'm always worried that i'm a terrible person or doing the wrong thing. i was a teen mom. my boyfriend dumped me about a month after i got pregnant.we ignored each other, until a month before my kid was born, i called him up, feeling bad, and said i wanted to try to be friends again. his response? i'll call you back. 8 years go by, and he contacts my sister at her work to get my phone number. i should add that his parents and mine know each other from shared sports and could have called or stopped by their house at any time in these 8 years. he also knows how to get a hold of my sister since they're still in the same sport and see each other over the years. he then called me and said he wanted to be in my daughter's life. i had a talk with her, explained that her real dad wanted to meet her. she was kind of apathetic about it but agreed. we met up a few times, and it was awkward as hell, but i tried being friendly. my daughter was just annoyed by it and didn't want to call him dad, didn't want to go out alone with him , and wanted me to be there. i kind of forced a few visits, saying just be nice when he wanted to see her but she didn't really want to. a few months go by, she's not getting close to him, he asks her to visit and she says no, so i tell him she doesn't want see him. he's upset but says i should call him whenever she does want to see him. a few months after that, i had asked her if she wanted to see him and she said no. i told her anytime she does, just let me know and we'll call him. she said okay, but she doesn't really care. five more years go by. i am now married to a wonderful man and have moved a couple hours away. yesterday he freaking shows up at my door. he hands me a card and says, i wanted to leave this for my daughter. i said okay and closed the door. i felt very violated and icky that he had sought me out and showed up unannounced and uninvited. my phone number is the same, he could have called. i texted him later on and said what he did was inappropriate and i'd appreciate it if he never shows up uninvited again. i was polite about it, but he got a little hostile and said he just wanted to see her. my now 14yr old and i read the card, which just said a couple lines like, sorry i haven't seen you, i hope you're doing well and i'd love to see you and he left his phone number. i asked her if she wants to see him and she said no. then she said now she feels obligated to text him or something. i said you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. she said okay cool, and then walked off and seemingly forgot about it. here's my problem. am i a terrible person for not seeking him out or arranging visitations??? am i keeping my kid from her real father by not forcing her to talk to him? should i bring it up more? obviously i'm happier and better off without him in my life, but if my daughter truly wanted to see him then i'd have no problem with it. part of me wonders if my daughter is just pretending to be apathetic to him, but she really just seems like she doesn't care. she met him, they didn't click, she doesn't care. but it bothers the hell out of me. i worry that i'm a terrible person. i worry that i'll die and god will tell me, why didn't you let him see your daughter? i just don't know what to do. i'd prefer to ignore him and hope he never comes around again. but he's come around twice in 14 years, so i'm sure it'll happen again. just wondering what everyone thinks.

advice on daycare	hi all, looking some advice again from this group! you all were so helpful the last time! here's the situation i have a 6 month old...my mother is currently keeping him for me 8 hours a day. my husband and i both work full time. the wait lists for daycare where i live is insane...literally two years wait for my top choice daycare. my second choice daycare just called and said they have a spot available next week. my mother recently retired about two years ago and i feel her watching my son is a burden to her. she says she is willing to watch him but then when i tell her it could be up to two years wait time from my top choice daycare, her hesitancy is palpable....which is completely understandable! i also do not think it is fair for her to have to watch a baby all day every day. she should be enjoying her retirement. on the other hand....i hate the idea of him going to daycare. i would love to just have my mom watch him permanently but i know it isn't fair to her and i know he will eventually have to go. i can take her up on her offer and have her keep him until a spot opens up at my top choice...potentially two years away...or i could go ahead and put him in daycare now. what are your thoughts? what would you do in my situation? thanks in advance for any feedback! i really appreciate it!

9 days postpartum, and extremely scared to go asleep when the baby is asleep.	since my daughter arrived, i've been paranoid to go to sleep while she's sleeping, i feel as if my husband should be awake while i sleep to watch over our daughter. i'm a first time mother, and i've been doubting myself a lot. one thing, i've seriously been doubting about is how cold our place should be especially at night, i feel he is being selfish keeping our home too cold for the baby...though my husband keeps it around 70-72...feels colder to me, and i would read the thermostat being 68-69. another reason i feel i have to check on our child constantly to see if she's breathing. i'm obsessed with everything that could go wrong instead of enjoying being a mother. if anyone has advice for these crazy thoughts, i'd love to know them, and just try to improve myself better for our child. thank you.

advice for homework	do any of you have advice for making homework go a little more smoothly. i feel like my expectations are high and maybe i need a reality check. kiddo just started school and now comes home with homework not much usually simple things but i feel like we're making the dash to high school. i know good habits now will follow her through and i'm really concerned because in school for me personally if i didn't find the subject interesting i tuned out and i've noticed that her attention span is really, really short like 10 minutes at most. would meditation or some kind of mindfulness exercise help both of us bond and work on homework without the frustrations that i've been having . the way i've been doing it so far is letting her have a snack when she gets home, dinner and then homework. is giving her the break from the school work as soon as she gets home what's causing the issue? the other question i have is do you think that it's too early for us to be teaching her about the basics of math? she knows her numbers and her shapes really well and we're working on her with entry into reading herself. i really don't want her to struggle like i did because i wasn't engaged. thanks in advance.

when speaking to your child about sexual abuse	so i want to have a discussion with my daughter about sexual abuse in general and i want to empower her to feel ok to tell someone that theyre making her feel uncomfortable or to talk to my husband and/or i if anything weird ever happens. i want to let her know about grooming and statistics and about how so many girls/women never report sexual abuse but should. now im wondering, because i was sexually abused when i was a kid, is it wise to tell her how i was sexually abused and how i wish i had said something back then or should i not tell her? i feel like it will make it more real when i talk to her about it, but i dont know if children need to know things of that nature about their parents. is the talk itself strong enough on its own?	dashagainstdarkness	/r/Mommit/comments/81k25f/when_speaking_to_your_child_about_sexual_abuse/	13	17	0	0.99	1520034709.0

i need advice on difficult family	so i am in therapy for ppd and anxiety. its pretty rough because i still have to go to work daily and deal with a ton of drama there. so my therapist told me if i dont want to socialize right now its fine. she said put myself first. i have seen her twice and she told me eventually i will work back into being social and she will give me tools to manage my anxiety my sil who isnt involved and when she is its only on her terms reappeared via text last night. havent seen her in months because she is to busy or doesnt reach out. we used to and kinda quit because she was flaky. also my therapist told me that im not responsible for maintaining relationships that its a 2 way street. so she texts us last night and said hey are you guys around saturday? i said let me check with my husband and then later responded by saying we are not that we have a client event. we dont but i am really trying to manage my anxiety and even her text gave me chest pains and sweating. i need to be stronger before i can be around her. i can elaborate on why but needless to say she isnt a supportive person. so then she responds with ok. thats it. no how are you, anything. i messaged her back saying i hope all is well, and a photo of my son so im kinda pissed about this. we dont hear from you for months and because we cant drop what we are doing to accommodate you, you just dont respond. it pisses me off. part of me wants to send some kind of snappy text back putting her on her place what do you think?	yournotthebossofme21	/r/Mommit/comments/84g4dg/i_need_advice_on_difficult_family/	9	19	0	0.88	1521055240.0

need help with making toddler sleep by herself!!	sorry this is so long please bare with me first a little about the situation; i have a 3 1/2 yo daughter that for most of her life has changed slept with me and my husband at least the last half of the night/morning. the past year i have been pregnant with our second child. our daughter had been pretty good with sleeping in her own room and bed as long as long as i cuddle and do stories etc. then she falls asleep and i leave the room. i gave birth feb 10th. my daughter was still ok with going into her bed but not only if she fell asleep in the living room then i carried her into her bed and she would sleep there until around 4-6am and come into our bed. but now as of a few weeks ago my daughter has been refusing to sleep or even lay down in her bed. she keeps saying she is scared because it's too dark, but i got her a projector star night light and even leave the main light on so it is plenty light in her room. but she still says she is too scared. i used to tell her if you don't use your room and don't sleep in your bed then i will give your room to your baby brother. at first that tactic worked and she would say no and sleep in her room. but now that is not working any more. she just tells me now ok my baby brother can have it. i have tried everything i can think of from bribes, to crawling in her bed with her, lights on, radio, laptop playing movies... she just refuses to sleep anywhere but my bed from the start. she will just did get heels in scream at is and refuse to even go in her room period and in not going to spank her for being scared.. it's so bad my husband has been sleeping on the couch because there isn't enough room for the newborns co sleeper, out daughter, me and hubby. even without the co sleeper there just isn't enough room for my daughter to sleep with us especially with how she kicks around am at my wit's end right now, help with any constructive advice please! i have 2 bedrooms mine and my daughter's, she has a special bed custom painted just for her, a co sleeper, crib and a video monitor. i'm wracking my brain trying to think got i can move things around to make my daughter cooperate and my husband sleep in my bed again. we have been thinking of turning our bedroom into an office and having the living room our bedroom and just have everyone sleep there, or put the crib in my daughter's room and my daughter's bed on my side of the bed so it's similar to sleeping with me..

help me decide whether to stop breastfeeding!	hi everyone! my son is 7 months old. he never quite got the hang of breastfeeding despite a lot of effort on both our parts, including recurring lactation consultant visits, so i exclusively pumped while i was on maternity leave . it sucked but it was important to me that be get only breastmilk. right as i was getting ready to go back to work full time, i got mastitis and my supply dropped drastically. i made the tough decision to supplement with formula and drop down to pumping in the morning before work and nursing when i get home/pumping before bed. im just getting over mastitis for a second time. for those of you luckies whove never had it, its like the worst pain imaginable in your boob plus you feel like you have the flu. its awful. now my supply has dropped yet again, so its not even enough for a full bottle each time. i told myself if after doing an ultrasound they found an abscess that needed surgery, i was going to quit for sure. luckily they didnt and it continues to improve with antibiotics. but im kind of over it, and i feel like my heart isnt really in it. i have ppd/ppa for which im taking zoloft and before i got help for it, i was really hard on myself. i thought i was a complete failure at being a mother since i was having such a hard time with breastfeeding. someone please help me decide whether its ok to stop breastfeeding!! i feel like im paralyzed with indecision. thank you!! 	hollylue	/r/Mommit/comments/8a5ir8/help_me_decide_whether_to_stop_breastfeeding/	24	5	0	0.78	1522978174.0

conflicted about when to stop breastfeeding!	hi all, so im a single mom of a cute little 7 month old boy named grayson. i havent been with his father since i was 4 months pregnant... he basically left me and didnt look back. there is very little communication between him and i now. im also a teacher, and have managed to continue breastfeeding for 7 months despite my crazy schedule. i pump in the closet during lunch then feed my lo in the evenings. the reason why im writing this post is because my desire to quit breastfeeding has grown quite a bit .... but really only for selfish reasons. its not hard for me anymore, doesnt hurt my nipples and my son still enjoys the bonding experience. really, what bothers me is how out of proportion my breasts look to my body. im already big busted when im not breastfeeding, but add that on top of it and im wearing bras that could fit someones head in one cup. ive found my self esteem is already suffering as it is, and i wake up everyday to these massive milk jugs on my chest. the weather is getting warmer and i have sooo few clothes that will fit me in that area. i guess my question is- is it selfish to quit breastfeeding now, just because im so tired of the way i look? the rest of my body i am comfortable with, as i attend the gym regularly. i should also say- i mentioned stopping soon to my mom and she gave me a speech about how good it is for the baby and how i have no real reason to quit already. some nice but honest feedback would be appreciated. thanks!

casual convo.. do you expect your s.o to gift you w anything on mother's day? why or why not?	i thought i'd ask some other ladies, because i am genuinely curious as to how everyone feels about mother's day. little unnecessary back story, lately my s.o kept carrying on about what he was going to do for his mom, gifts he was getting, etc. that's fine and all, but he kind of throws me off track because he constantly mentions how his mom left & never raised him, acts rude towards her, etc.. fast forward 20 years, she moves 5 minutes away from us, from states away. so i jokingly ask, what are you getting me? he looks at me & replies a hug i honestly was a bit shocked! but laughed it off & looked at my 8 month old & said, i pushed you out naturally, for a hug dude to which the s.o says it's his job to get you something . i wasn't really hurt, but more surprised at his lack of effort & how serious he was. his mother & i get along well, so there's no issue there! it just genuinely made me curious how you guy's s.o take on the holiday. thanks for the chat! edit i love the feedback from all of you. made me feel less crazy, lol. i definitely will be expressing my feelings to s.o.	dropdeadaudrey	/r/Mommit/comments/8gbdxd/casual_convo_do_you_expect_your_so_to_gift_you_w/	57	41	0	0.98	1525204554.0
2 month old constantly nurses and co sleeps. i go back to work in a month. advice please.	my daughter is 2 months old. she went through a growth spurt at around 4 or 5 weeks where she would never let me put her down and nursed all day long. ever since that growth spurt, she wont even sleep with my husband like she used to. even if i can successfully put her in her bassinet asleep, so far the longest she stayed asleep for was half an hour. when shes awake, she just wants to nurse. she only seems to fall asleep from nursing. and throughout the day its just tiny cat naps. nurses, cat nap, nurse, cat nap, etc.. at night shell sleep for longer chunks, 2-4 hours at a time, but only if i keep holding her. so not only does this not give me any time to pump anyways, but it feels like im barely keeping up with her appetite. i go back to work in a month. shell be going to a daycare. so advice please on how to get her to sleep in her bassinet. and also to be happy with being bottle fed. even if its breast milk in the bottle, its not satisfying for her it seems and shell stay awake until she gets boob.

how to fundraise for a music program in a school where no one participates?	my daughter is in kindergarten at an amazing dual-language school. the pa fully funded the schools' first year of a music program. they are currently trying to fund raise with a read-a-thon where the kids get sponsors to read. the thing is there are almost no kids participating. i understand that they are a diverse group of kids with varying amounts of time - but urban public schools need the additional funding that fundraisers like this can provide. it makes me crazy - the pa needs about 18,000 to fund next year's music program and they're only asking for 7500 in this read-a-thon and they're not even close to hitting the mark. it's depressing. for example - only 3 kids out of 50 kindergarteners have raised any money and that's pretty close to the activity in the other grades. how do i get the word out other than facebook and emailing friends? if anyone wants to donate i can dm you the link - send me a message. i would love any ideas on how to get the word out.	moretaj	/r/Mommit/comments/8hfhjm/how_to_fundraise_for_a_music_program_in_a_school/	4	11	0	0.92	1525616581.0

husband is going to prison. now what? 	i'm using my throwaway account for privacy reasons, but the tl;dr is that my husband is going to prison for 21 months and i will be on my own with our ten month old during his sentence. i'd rather not get into the specifics of his crime, but suffice to say that it was a non-violent victimless crime, and he is still a good man, a fantastic partner, and a wonderful father. his absence will be horrible. he has to surrender in one month, and we're not sure yet where he'll go . so... what do i do now? how do i parent our son on my own? we have a finished basement with a walkout, and we talked about renting it out while he's away so i can bring in some money to absorb some of the financial impact. but what about the day-to-day? how do i work full time and raise a son on my own? are there any single moms here who can share your experiences? anyone else with an incarcerated so who can offer some support or insight?	thwoaway456	/r/Mommit/comments/8iq4ex/husband_is_going_to_prison_now_what_xpost/	33	89	0	0.91	1526064031.0

just in case you're wondering what life is like with 3 kids	actually, i have 5, but the older two are 16 and 13 and had no part in this madness. the little ones are kristen , michael , and preston . all names have been changed. the boys and i had a fairly uneventful morning. nurse the baby to sleep, his brother wakes him up. repeat infinitely. then it was time to go get kristen from school. michael had his pajamas on still, so i had to chase him and hold him down to get dressed. load the baby in the car seat and walk to the car, which i meant to start earlier to get the ac going, but i forgot. so i set preston down, start the car, and put him in, while yelling at michael to just get. in. the. car. and leave the flowers alone. he insists that there's a bug i absolutely need to come and see, this is very important. so i go see the bug, and fight him to get in the car while he's yelling about doing it himself. isn't independence adorable? /s we get to the school and have to deal with the evil that is the car rider line. preston started screaming as soon as the car stopped moving. so i got him out and put him in the front seat and nurse him while we wait. michael was watching spongebob on the dvd player. those things are the best addition to any car ever. seriously. preston fell asleep about 2 minutes before the bell rang, and of course, he woke up as i was putting him back in his car seat. kristen gets in the car, excitedly telling me about her day. my husband texted asking if i could stop by and see him at work to give him a kiss, and i had the bright idea to go grab starbucks for us. i pulled up to starbucks, and kristen starts whining about being hungry. i can't get her anything at starbucks because michael is allergic to eggs and it's not fair to get her something and not him. so i tell her we'll be home soon and she can get food. then, i pull up to the pickup window, open my wallet, and see no debit card. awesome. it's in my jeans pocket on my bedroom floor. perfect place for it. so i had to call my husband to see if i could come get money since starbucks already made our drinks. i pulled up outside his work and preston immediately starts screaming. i got the money, drove back to starbucks, which is literally across the street, and went to the drive thru line again. i told the guy working there that i was the idiot who ordered and didn't have money, but i'm back! with money this time! preston was screaming through the whole entire wait because the car wasn't moving. get the coffee, drive back across the street to give my husband his, and kristen starts whining. >i'm hungry! me did you not eat lunch today? >yes, i ate lunch. but i'm hungry! i want mcdonald's. me we can't get mcdonald's. i don't have any money. and we have food at home. >but i don't want the food at home! i want mcdonald's! me then i guess you're just gonna have to be hungry. cue ignoring her for 1.5 minutes while i give my husband his coffee and get a kiss. and the baby starts screaming. pull out of the parking lot, straight to a red light, where he commences screaming louder, protesting the stopped car. get on the interstate and he mercifully falls asleep. whew. then spongebob went off, so i turn on moana. kristen but i don't wanna watch moana! me we are literally 10 minutes from home. you can watch it for 10 minutes. you'll be fine. michael mama! ow! look! ow on my leg! me yes, buddy. i see the ow. let's please try to be quiet and let preston sleep, okay? kristen maaammmaaaaa! i'm huuuunnngggrryyy! me yes, i understand you're hungry. i do not have anything in the car for you to eat. we will be home soon and i'll get you some food. kristen but i'm hungry nooooooww! me what exactly do you expect me to do? i am driving home. as soon as we get there, we will get you something to eat. you just have to wait a few more minutes. michael mama! moana! look! me yes, baby, i know it's moana. i can't look. i'm driving right now. we had to stop at a red light. the baby, thankfully, stayed asleep. kristen whyyyyy are we stopping? i'm huuuunnngggrryyy! me because it's a red light. we have to stop. i'm getting us home as fast as i can. i take a sip of my triple espresso drink and will away the headache. yes, i breastfeed and consume massive amounts of caffeine. judge away. pull up in my driveway and kristen is snoring in the back seat. i tried to quietly wake her up while keeping the baby asleep. no such luck. i tell kristen she should go lay down after getting a snack. kristen but i'm not tired! i'm just huunnggry! oh. em. effing. gee. i need a shower. i need tylenol. i need 5 minutes of quiet. but that's not happening. and that's okay. if i had 5 minutes of quiet, i would miss the chaos. i'm currently sitting on the couch, nursing the baby for the 47th time today while i watch kristen try to teach michael about different denominations of money. and my head still hurts. but i wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. and when they're asleep tonight, i'll be wondering what i could have done better. and vowing to not lose my patience tomorrow, although i inevitably will. they are maddening. they are crazy. they are rambunctious and whiny and loud. but they are my heart and i couldn't imagine my life without them.	mandolin2712	/r/Mommit/comments/8kgejl/just_in_case_youre_wondering_what_life_is_like/	40	160	0	0.94	1526676602.0

advice needed, moving out on my own as a single mom w/ a 4yo.	hey so this might be a bit long but i need all of the advice here, please. first as backstory, i am 24 years old and a single mom to a 4 year old girl. i have been in college full time since fall 2016 and will be taking classes over the summer, one online and one in class 2 days a week for 3-4 hours each day. my daughter just finished headstart and i am hoping to get her into transitional kindergarten in the fall but i might end up having to put her back into headstart full time. her dad is kind of in the picture, but only when i message him or seek him out to see her, and he can't help financially. there is no custody agreement and his name is not listed on the birth certificate. currently we live with my mom and older sister and it's all a mess. we all fight a lot, my mom has 4 dogs, and the only income we have is my mom's ssi and my welfare. okay so the problems. i need to get a job and move out, but there are few jobs in my area and a lot of unemployed people looking for work, i lie in california and can't move out of state because of college, and i have never lived on my own and have no one to move in with. i have no idea how it'll be to live on my own, i don't know how to drive, i am going to try my hardest getting a job but it seems so unlikely, and i am worried about keeping up with classes and my daughter and work. moving out right now is a necessity though, my dad died last may and while i really wanna stay everything is beyond stressful and it's not good for me or my daughter and i need to be out on my own.

my 3.5 month old eating less?!! why!!!	my son used to eat around 4 oz per feeding but now when bottle fed, he only drinks 2.5 oz per feeding and doesn't show any interest in eating or show any signs of hunger for about 2-3 hours. i think he drinks about 20-24 oz per day. is this normal for a 15 week old? i think i am starting to panic because when my son drink about 2 oz, i am persistent and make sure to try again in about 10-15 minutes or even an hour to see if he changed his mind, but i think daycare is less concerned about making sure he got enough so i worry if he wont be getting enough to eat. my son will cry if he is hungry but if you hold him or give him physical contact he stops crying, and i have noticed the teachers at daycare holding him a lot , so i worry my son isnt showing them signs of hunger while being held. i worry because i heard a story of a baby that was going to the same daycare that the teachers starved the baby bc she was taking so long to eat and poor babys weight dropped to 2% around six months, when all she needed was an increase in the nipple size. i worry the same might happen to my son, but currently he is at 60% in body weight. he has been some what more fussier, wants to be held most of the time and is wanting more physical contact. otherwise, as long as we meet his needs, like holding him or giving him attention, he is super smiley and happy. would teething be a cause of him wanting to eat less? he is drooling a ton,and he bites the nipple while nursing and while drinking out of a bottle and constantly puts his hands in his mouth. im just super worried since he is sooo young, and development is crucial at this age. did any other moms go through a similar experience in regards to eating habits of a 3.5 month old and did it get better over time?	choeding	/r/Mommit/comments/8mgoxj/my_35_month_old_eating_less_why/	4	9	0	0.92	1527412463.0
why do people think it's okay to ask personal questions just because you have a baby?	i'll try to explain this as simply as possible, but we are at my mils house for memorial day since there's a parade that goes right in front of her house. she has a cookout every year during the parade. this year her in laws from out of state were in town. so it was her husband's sisters. her husband is my husband's stepdad so he had never even met his sister's, so they're not like his aunt's or anything. obviously since he hasn't even met them, i've never met them either. we have a newborn baby, about 8 weeks old, and everyone was very excited to see her. especially this woman we'll call kay, one of my mils sister in laws. so me and my husband are sitting in the living room with the baby and kay comes in and starts asking us all kinds of questions. like, was she planned? how long did it take us to conceive? what birth control was i taking? when did i stop taking it? what birth control am i on now? when are we going to have another? and all sorts of questions that i feel are somewhat personal. especially for a stranger to be asking. i was really kind of taken aback by her asking if my baby was planned. maybe it's just me but i think that's sort of a rude question. overall it was a pretty frustrating experience.

need advice about in-laws... rant 	my in-laws are nice enough, i suppose. i say that because i've seen horror stories, and i don't have anything like that, but mine tend to believe that the world revolves around them and their family . my dh is an only child, and she thinks that he hung the moon. he's pretty amazing, but i do not appreciate the constant comparisons about my son to him... everything ds does she responds to with just like his daddy! when i was pregnant, i felt more like an incubator for her grand child than her dil. i had a mc before i was pregnant with ds, and we were trying to keep things under wraps, and enjoy telling people when we felt it was right. i was terrified, and had constant anxiety. cut to us getting to a grad party last year, and she proudly announces to us as we walk in that she told everyone our secret. my mil is also not girly by any means... she's a grown up tomboy. my dh responds to everything by saying i'm sure she didn't mean it... she's not like that, she doesn't like the attention {lie}... it's beyond frustrating. in short, i put up with a lot, i think, and i do it in a fairly laid back fashion. we don't really fight about them, so nothing has ever been a huge problem in our marriage. i'm starting to worry more and more about my mil's disgusting smoking habit , around him. my grandmother just passed away from copd complications, and she never smoked a day in her life... it was all due to secondhand smoke exposure, and a predisposition to lung issues . she suffered a lot, and i'm very sensitive to it. my mil insists on continuing to smoke, and boasts about how she would bf my husband with one side, and smoke with her other hand, and he's just fine. i can't even with how f-ing ignorant this is, but whatever. she goes out to smoke at my house now, because i'm not allowing that in my house, and she knows i never have. we're currently in the process of trying to list our home, and they've come over to help with my son. she has started to smoke, bring the butts in the house and put them under water, and then put them in my garbage can. for anyone that hasn't smelled this aroma, it basically smells like a$$. it's horrid, and physically makes me ill. she did this today, again, after my husband was going to talk to her about this. the last time we had this problem, we had to literally spray the garbage can out with diluted bleach, and air the can out in the sun, so we could get rid of the smell. we literally just buried my grandmother last week, so i'm a little raw about things like cigarette smoke. i am boiling... we have had heated arguments about her being around the baby. i don't want him exposed to anything with cigarette smoke, including my mil's clothes. i have to bathe and change him once she leaves, because he smells like it. i don't want to take him away from his grandmother, but i can't help that this is her habit, and i don't want my son exposed to it. we're also moving soon, and i don't want to have to deal with any of this when we get to our new home. i suggested having her smoke in her car, or just not smoke for the few hours at a time she actually comes and sees us. i don't want to ruffle feathers, but i'm at my last straw with dealing with this. i don't want this at my new house. and dh, i think, feels awkward telling her not to smoke at our house. he has said well, it's unfair to make her smoke in the car. i think it's unfair that me and my son have to be exposed to this, and i have to go out of my way to clean things, including my kid, because she stinks everything up. this is such a delicate issue, and i'm just not sure what to even do anymore. has anyone had to deal with a situation like this? so sorry for the long post!	hounddogmama	/r/Mommit/comments/8ncozx/need_advice_about_inlaws_rantish/	36	75	0	1.0	1527717817.0

how did you decide to go from 1 to 2 kids? is my whole life going to be career + kids with nothing left over?	people who had one kid... how did you decide whether to have a second? we have a two year old, i'm no spring chicken, and i want to make the decision this year. we both work in tech, and having a kid was stressful professionally and personally. we lost sleep, i wasn't firing at all cylinders, and now things are starting to calm down. a little. should we reopen everything, and do it again? take another hit to our stress and sanity, a major hit to my career, and then have two young kids, 3ish years apart? will whatever's left of our creative and industrial spirit dry up and die, or will things be hard and then we'll be a functioning family of four? my husband feels we need help if we were to do this. way more help. with no family nearby, we've been using in -home daycares during working hours. i can get more babysitters on the shortlist, but that leaves all those nights. my husband thinks we'd need a night nurse, i don't like the idea of a strange person in my home every night , and with breastfeeding it's hard to see it making a big difference. we've talked au pairs, but our house is very small and, again, introvert. plus the cost of college... should i just cherish this amazing girl i have and be happy being a family of 3? i can't shake the idea that she'll be happier and healthier with a siblings, and so will we as we all get older. we're in the bay area.	le_plateau	/r/Mommit/comments/8of74v/how_did_you_decide_to_go_from_1_to_2_kids_is_my/	52	60	0	0.97	1528094116.0

not even sure what my questions are about sleep, breastfeeding and discipline	first off, i am so tired, i apologize if none of this makes sense. my lo is 13months, still breastfeeding to sleep for naps and nighttime. we spent last weekend in the hospital after 2 weeks of her being sick. so, her sleep and everything is all out of whack. prior to her getting sick i was down to 3 to 4 breastfeeding sessions a day, morning nap and night. now though, her eating schedule has gone out the window, she wont eat at meals but will find ways to eat basically a meal at snack time. she is constantly trying to breastfeed throughout the day. every other night she is waking up to breastfeed and just be held for a couple hours. she had a cold for a week then a fever for a week, by the time we got to the hospital she was acting normal and her fever was gone. while she was sick/especially in the hospital i was just trying to get her to eat anything and sleep when she could. now, i feel like she is 4 months old again and nothing makes sense, except she can run away from me. weve been home/not sick for a week and i tried easing her back into her routine but im just so exhausted with trying to catch up on everything and her being on her own schedule. also, im trying to figure out how to wean her from bfing to sleep. she has a milk intolerance still so im trying almond milk once in a while and she will take a sip here or there but thats it. can someone please just reassure me this is all going to work itself out eventually? or give me some pointers, anything. edit i forgot to add the part about discipline. she understands what no means but she definitely disregards it when it comes to breastfeeding. i need help figuring out how to be firm but obviously not like upset or anything.

need advice - 10 month old has forgotten how to sleep	i'm at my wits end with this right now. our baby girl is 10 months old and has never slept through the night and has very rarely been able to fall asleep on her own despite our sleep training efforts. in the last two weeks it has taken nearly 2 hours to get her to sleep for naps and bedtime, and then she's up every couple of hours thereafter at night. i thought she was teething but tylanol does nothing. she won't go down with anyone but me for naps and bedtime - it takes my husband a lot more time and she throws screaming fits. at least with me she doesn't scream as much. i've tried getting her on a schedule and no naps past 5pm but i end up spending the day trying to get her to sleep. any advice or suggestions please!!	gladiola26	/r/Mommit/comments/8pqgb2/need_advice_10_month_old_has_forgotten_how_to/	9	2	0	1.0	1528519014.0

i don't know how to deal with this..	hello everyone! i'm needed a bit of advice on how to deal with other children dealing with how my daughter looks. earlier this year my four year old daughter was attacked by a pitbull during a family gathering. i do not wish to go into detail since it is still pretty hard for me to explain. she had a five hour reconstructive surgery for her face and had to have multiple stitches/staples in her head. it was all a horrible experience. she spent about a week in the hospital before she was released, only needing to give her pain medicine and to change her bandages. we were extremely lucky and i thank god everyday that it wasn't worse. although she recovered fully she has harsh scars on the left side of her face. i'm terrified of how other children are going to treat her, especially now that she will be starting preschool in a couple of months. the scars are going down her nose, on her jawline and just under her eye with a small bald stop on that back of her head where hair has yet to grow out. we already had one incident in her church school class where a little boy kept making fun of her, i could just tell.. at the moment she was hurting. i don't know what to do, or tell her when kids stare or ask what happened..

who am i?	sorry for format on my mobile! since baby made an entrance 7 months ago, i've been struggling to cope with my new body . i've had many breakdowns, alone and with dh and my anxiety has sky rocketed. anyway, i'm losing track. who am i? i have no hobbies, minimal social interaction and my day revolves around baby and counting down till dh returns from work. i also have no interests. i know people will say you must like something but i really don't. i just don't know who i am. i rarely leave the house during the day. i know its not healthy for my son but i also find it hard to make it out the door. i hate where we live. it's tiny. one , ten minute walk route that is suitable for a buggy, i tried walking but there's only so many laps you can do before it gets extremely boring. my friends are childless so don't understand this struggle. my dh has many interests, music, gaming and reading, i envy this because i don't understand how i make myself have an interest in something. before baby i read a lot but between taking care of a baby, cleaning and cooking and just getting to talk to another adult in the evening, i just don't feel bothered to read. i want a shower, some food, a cup of tea and my bed. it is obvious my mental health isn't in a good place but i don't know how to fix this? i love my child to bits but i just feel lost? like i don't have a personality anymore. i can't talk to people about anything else because i do nothing else! just want to see if any other mothers have any advice or support. thank you.	spicebagqueen	/r/Mommit/comments/8rmky1/who_am_i/	11	5	0	0.79	1529186051.0

advice wanted from those with big families 	hi mums. i'm using a throwaway as this will probably have a fair amount of personal info. i have 4 kids of my own eldest is 4, nearly 3 year old twins, youngest is15 months. i have 6 year old twin neices. their mother has always struggled with her mental health but things have now taken quite a turn and the girls need somewhere stable to be while mum undergoes psychiatric help. we don't know at the moment how permanent the arrangement will be, but we are really the only viable option for the girls to stay within the family while their mum can't look after them. they will be with us for a minimum of 6 months but possibly/probably longer and they arrive wednesday afternoon! so, mums of big families, what practical things do i need to get my head around pronto? i'd like to do as much in the next 24hrs as possible as i expect i'm going to be incredibly busy very soon! my list so far - bigger car and car seats for both of them - beds - storage space for their things i'm thinking there must be so much every day stuff i won't necessarily think of, like getting pans big enough to make enough pasta/whatever for dinner i have a meeting with our local school tomorrow morning but there is one place in their year group from september and, as twins, they can both be placed into a single available place iyswim so that's really good news for a start.

having a difficult time keeping up with pumping & breastfeeding because i feel depressed when i do it. any advice?	hey mamas! i recently made a post about feeling depressed when i pump and trying to cope with it. i am 11 days postpartum with my beautiful baby girl and have been both pumping and breastfeeding. at first it wasnt so bad, but everyday seems to be more of a challenge. i pump every 2-3 hours and breastfeed in between every other pumping session. both make me feel like i suddenly have a cloud of doom over my head, the instant i begin, and then its stops about 30 minutes after, and i am totally fine. the problem with this is that in order to keep up my milk supply and feed my baby, i need to pump and breastfeed often so i am beginning to feel more often than not, just sad. i have tried to be positive because i know how beautiful what i am doing is, but i believe whats happening is hormonal. im so in love with my girl and providing for her is incredible but its been so hard for me to handle these feelings and i am losing motivation. ive tried to distract myself while i pump and breastfeed and tried focusing on her when it happens but nothing helps and it leaves me feeling terrible. i am not against supplementing formula a tiny bit, but even then id have to pump often to maintain my supply. my lactation consultant says these feelings are normal and to keep going by my daughters pediatrician thinks that it may be best to breast feed occasionally and supplement formula. i am just wanting to hear opinions on what to do/hear from people who have been through this? thanks so much!!!	beachblonde74	/r/Mommit/comments/8ub08g/having_a_difficult_time_keeping_up_with_pumping/	20	9	0	0.91	1530116742.0

how to find a balance? help a mumma in need!	hey mamas! i need a bit of advice. my situation is a complex one so please bare with me, it may be long i have 3 children. my partner works full time and so isn't at home all too often. child number three has a rare and complex heart condition. this has meant it's been a long and difficult journey, and so far has had 10 surgeries. 4 out of those 10 times she had her chest opened up to access her heart. she requires a lot of medical attention, appointments, medications, treatments etc. she is a wheelchair user and is potentially on the autism spectrum and has adhd. she very rarely sleeps. i'm lucky if she gets 6 hours of broken sleep, and for a child with half a heart she should be sleeping more and definitely sleeping through the night, so she has been put on melatonin that is helping her nod off but not helping to keep her asleep through the night. this has resulted in child number one having ptsd, he was diagnosed with this when he was 6. he also suffers from joint hypermobility syndrome . he needs physio therapy and counselling to deal with those issues. then child number two is autistic, possible adhd and has a rare allergy to the sun. this requires a heck of a lot of care, ointments, precautions and supervision to ensure she doesn't end up really ill. i myself am going through an induced menopause due to severe endometriosis. i also have arthritis in my neck and spine which will require spinal surgery with a risk of paralysation. i have fibromyalgia, joint hypermobility syndrome and asthma too. so, now that i've explained our circumstances i will now get to the point i don't have any sort of caring support from the government. i do everything on my own and always have. i have previously been denied some support because she can handle it on her own . i am finding it hard to get a balance. i need to make sure i take care of myself to avoid rapid deterioration, but i also have to care for my kids full time. the girls are more high maintenance than my son. it is proving to be really difficult to make sure they are all happy and get one to one time with me. i don't ever get any time with them individually and it seems doing things with them alone in the house isn't enough. i feel like i'm failing as a parent, and want to find some sort of solution. i wish i could be healthy and split myself in three but that's impossible. my health is only going to get worse and i'm going to end up in a wheelchair. financially, my partner stopping work isn't possible, we have sat down and worked through our finances and if he left work to help we would sink into poverty and debt. he's the breadwinner of the family. what can i do to make sure all of my children get the one on one attention they deserve? they are otherwise happy, fed and well cared for but fighting for my attention is becoming a problem. thanks! x	LazySugarCane	/r/Mommit/comments/8vlzbw/how_to_find_a_balance_help_a_mumma_in_need/	5	15	0	0.94	1530563387.0

what kind of cup to offer a 2 year old?	we've been using the munchkin 360 cups for though out the day drinking, filled with water and just placed on the kitchen table for him to grab. we also provide him a fresh one to take with him to bed that stays with him overnight. during meals, we give him an with milk which he has no problem drinking from. - do you give your child water at night, in what kind of cup? - are the 360 cups with handles something i should transition away from? should i get the handless version or are the 360 cups something in general something i should transition away from and just always use an open cup? - at what age should they be fully using an open cup? and until then, are using the 360 sippy cups ok or is there another type to use? are cups with straws something to encourage and transition to?	derpyderpkitten	/r/Mommit/comments/8vv7h8/what_kind_of_cup_to_offer_a_2_year_old/	5	2	0	1.0	1530647101.0
formula feeding from birth? need advice	hello, bromos. my first was exclusively boob fed. the issue is, he had terrible allergies. i mean - all i was allowed to eat for a year was turkey, rice and some vegetables. no red meat, no gluten, no milk, no other type of dairy, no sugar, no soy, no nothing. it made zero effect on baby's health - still terrible poop, still fought with staph, still had issues with weight gain. at three months i had enough and wanted to introduce bottle, but he wouldn't take it. so i kept this struggle, used lactase before feeding, tons of other medicine, but nothing helped until we started introducing solids. now we are actively ttcing for a second baby. i don't want him to suffer. i don't want low weight again, concerned looks from others. i don't want to bf just for bfs sake. is it okay to formula feed from the start? my husband is extremely allergic and i believe our second child will still have these issues. i am not ready for that roller-coaster again. if you have any advice, please, i really would appreciate it!	littleshroom	/r/Mommit/comments/8w05re/formula_feeding_from_birth_need_advice/	20	7	0	0.89	1530694057.0

but how many diapers?	ftm mom here, 34 weeks and have had an interesting pregnancy so far so we'll see how much longer she keeps baking in there. target has a great deal this week $30 gift card when you purchase $100 in diapers, wipes and baby toiletries. we plan on cloth diapering but we have some other questions about how many disposables we need. we have 2 128 packs of newborn diapers and 1 pack of size 1s. i also have 4 large boxes of wipes. we do plan on using disposable diapers at first since i know cloth diapers don't fit very well. she is measuring tiny, like 10th percentile tiny so it might be a while before she grows into cloth diapers. even with that being said, eventually she will go to daycare and they don't cloth diaper. i also know target has a fairly generous return policy when it comes to baby stuff but in all serious...should i get another $100 of diapers and wipes? i mean i can clearly always buy more as i need them, but i figure i have maybe a month of newborn diapers.

okay moms - my daughter's bff just came out as trans here's how i handled it, hoping someone's had a similar experience?	tl;dr daughters lifelong friend now presents male, they're upset we're applying house rules that forbid opposite sex friends in bedrooms. looking for any advice or stories of experiences like this? here's the back story i grew up with this kid's mom. we were best friends for nearly 20 years, until she developed a nasty drug habit. her crazy behavior ultimately culminated in her making false reports to child services, in an attempt to get back at me . our friendship, needless to say, did not survive after that. prior to that time, we'd been quite close. we both have daughters, they're about a year apart in age, and until my daughter was 9, they were together often. our girls have always been very close, but after the blowout with my former friend, we didn't see either of them for several years. flash forward about 3 years. a letter is dropped at the house. the kid wants to reconnect. she's living with dad's parents now. mom's not in the picture. okay, we say, come on by! you're always welcome. she shows up, we have a great time, her and my daughter hang out, all is good. we don't hear from her again until about 6mos later. i get a text saying there's something she'd like to talk about, has nothing to do with her mom, but it's important and self-related . okaaay. come on by, we say. time she's to arrive comes and goes, and i get another text - basically, hey, i identify as male now, i didn't know how to tell you. should i still come? woah. okay, my 12yo is expecting her childhood girl friend - how do i explain this? talk to my husband. what we come up with is not my kid, not my business. if this is what makes her happy? i can swap a name and a pronoun. still the same kid, just a different haircut, as far as this concerns us. so we talk to our daughter. explain that this is evidently what makes her friend happy, and since it has no bearing on our lives, the only right thing to do, in our opinion, is simply accept the changes, and be happy for her friend that they've found something that gives them some peace. awesome. so i respond to the text is there a name change we need to know? preferred pronouns? and of course you should still come. can't promise we'll get it right all the time, but we'll definitely try, if you're cool being patient while we adjust! so we play it out, see what happens. kiddo shows up, and we were right, same kid, different haircut. here's where my daughter is mad at me - we mentioned, after her friend had left, that since he's a boy now, he'll have to follow boy rules - no boys in girl bedrooms. just like no girls in boy bedrooms. literally nothing else changes. i'm concerned that her friend will take this change personally, but my feeling is that if he'd like to be treated like a male, the best and only thing i can do is treat him like a boy all the way, and sorry, but no you won't be allowed in her bedroom, alone, behind closed doors. it has nothing to do with anything else but fairness. idk what i'm doing here!

how to help your child to learn a new language when you don't know it yourself	learning a new language is quite challenging. it could be even more challenging to help your child to learn a new language if you dont know about it! so how to live up to their teacher?! here are some useful suggestion 1. think outside the house whether your child is learning chinese, french, german, or spanish, theres bound to be somewhere around town where your child can get some practice in. take them to a chinese restaurant and buy them their favorite dish but only if they can place the order in chinese! this creates both a challenge and a reward, two important parts of a successful lesson. you can take it a step further by putting yourself in the shoes of the clueless tourist, letting your child take the lead in helping you order a dish to your taste using their second language skills. 2. practicing at home if you dont live in an area with a strong international community, or if getting out of the home isnt too practical at the moment, no problem! getting involved in your childs second language practice at home is a piece of cake! if you havent already done so, buy some television series and movies and watch them with your child. after watching, talk about what you just saw and how you interpret what happened. if you didnt understand, its not a problem; you dont have to be right! in fact, by making mistakes, whether intentional or not, youre giving your child an opportunity to correct you and feel empowered by their language abilities. what other ways do you suggest?!

36 years old, ttc 3, and then what....?	so, my husband and i are currently ttc 3. we have two awesome little girls , and with them we didnt actively try, we just didnt prevent. we got pregnant within 2-3 cycles for both girls. this time around, given my age, were actively trying. aaaaanyway, so im driving myself a little bit crazy waiting for time to pass so i can take a pregnancy test, and as i wait, im thinking about the future. if were successful, this will be the last addition to our family. i am likely to have a c-section because my other two were sections. if youre not familiar with the c-section experience, then you might be surprised to know that the ob will ask whether you want a tubal ligation. in my first two sections, i said no. we knew we wanted more than 1 baby, but werent 100% sure about having a third. this time, were sure. this will be the last one. so! all that to ask for those of you who know for certain that you are finished, what did you decide to do for contraception? the ligation sounds great, but the lit scares me . an iud sounds like a good option, but there are horror stories there too. ive been on the pill for a long time, so im familiar with it, but honestly im kind of just tired of having to remember to take it everyday. thank you in advance for your thoughts and input! ninja edit a word for clarity.	drmom26	/r/Mommit/comments/93zcpa/36_years_old_ttc_3_and_then_what/	17	8	0	0.9	1533217194.0

potty training advice	we are working on potty training our two year old . over the past few weeks she has told us every time she was peeing in her diaper, requested a new diaper change as soon as she is wet/dirty, and has taken an interest in potty training conversation/books/helping baby doll go potty, etc. we started a sticker chart, along with an immediate m&m reward right after she goes potty, and put her in pull-ups . she tells us she has to go potty and we run to the potty and sit down. this whole time she is crying and clearly anxious, but we sit and sit, and i try to relax her and sing, etc. she continues to hold it in..ask for a diaper...i keep encouraging. finally she goes and is super happy and excited and we do the stickers and treat and celebrate. she goes one more time that night and we do the same celebration. this morning we start right away, and she is back to holding it. like holding it for 3-4 hrs. she clearly has to go and will sit on the potty, but just cries and cries. its like shes knows she doesnt want to have an accident, but shes scared to go in the potty. we do this over and over and over again. shes still holding it. finally i just feel so bad i put a diaper on her and tell her its okay to go potty in her diaper . she still didnt go until like an hr later and clearly holding it. finally went in her diaper and immediately asked for a new diaper. i dont get it though, weve been super positive and never negative or mad about an accident, but shes scared to go in the potty and scared to have an accident. where do we go from here? do we just completely drop it for awhile...or continue encouraging and being positive like we are? i cant stand to watch her be so emotionally upset and in pain from holding it, yet at the same time i feel like im being as neutral and positive about it as i can be. helllllp!	jjjlak	/r/Mommit/comments/953cbd/potty_training_advice/	3	2	0	1.0	1533576931.0

my sleep training guide to help other mamas. 	i wanted to post this here because i wanted to give some other moms advice i was so disheartened about sleep training and i wrote two posts about needing help with sleep training, see history. i just wanted to write this to give other mamas hope and try to explain what i did and why i did it. first off i started training a little over a week ago, and i wouldnt have done the training unless we absolutely had too, and we did because my lo wouldnt stop using my boobs as a pacifier and i think she wasnt getting any real sleep and would literally wake up 12 times a night. it was nightmarish. so we tried gentler methods and they didnt work at all so we had to resort to a method of crying it out i am a mama that loves attachment parenting styles so this was so hard for me you dont even know! when i started it i decided i was going to do it with my lo in the room, where i would have a mattress and be with her while she was crying it out so it wouldnt be a horrible shock to her system because we were bed sharing before this. i also want to say she and i reduced her food intake/time she was eating, and i used the book 12 hours sleep in 12 weeks as a loose guide to help me get the food part down so youll see in the guide below how much she reduced her feeds herself each night. it happened almost naturally but i did start reducing the time of the feeds by 3 minutes on friday night myself and i also made sure she got more food during the day too. so here is what happened during the week and how much total crying happened. sleep training started july 31st tuesday. crying 40 minutes with me in room at 8 30pm finally went down, worst night ever. lo got up 4 times 11. 2. 4. 5 nursed each time. got in bed with me at 5am. 40 minutes total crying. wednesday crying twenty minutes with me in the room at 8pm. got up three times 11.2.4 nursed each time then got in bed with me at 5. i put her back in crib twice in middle night- she cried for thirty minutes each time. slept in room. so a total of 80minutes crying. thursday didnt stay in room decided to let her cry it out without me in there as my presence was making it a lot worse and a lot longer. she cried for awhile probably 20 minutes and i went on a walk because i couldnt listen to it. she got up at 11 that night and 4am. at 11 she ate then cried but went back to sleep after fifteen minutes. at 4 she ate then cried for 40 minutes. 60 minutes total crying friday she cried for 15 minutes when going in crib at 8pm. then woke up at only 4 30 and ate and then went back in crib till 7am cried for 15 minutes probably at 4 30. 30 minutes total crying saturday same as friday, came in bed with me at 6am tossed and turned the whole time. 30 minutes total crying sunday she cried for twenty minutes at 7pm when she went down to sleep, then woke at 4 00am.and she ate then in crib crying for ten minutes woke up at 5 00 am for short amount of time went back down after crying for five minutes. total crying 35 minutes. monday she went to sleep in 7 minutes of crying. woke at 1.27 am for some reason, fed for 3 minutes. went back to sleep after crying for a little. woke up at 2,3, and 5am. cried a lot. 60 minutes crying tuesday went to sleep at 6 40pm, was exhausted. woke up at 5am ate a lot, went back down in crib and slept basically right away with only two or three minutes of crying. total crying less than five minutes. longest time sleeping from 6 40pm-5am!! 10 hours and 20 minutes sleep wednesday started doing naps today, went down for nap in own crib at 11 45, fell asleep at 12 00. 15 minutes crying time at nap time. first nap ever by herself! anyway this is it, honestly it was so hard the second day i had a break down so big because making her cry it out wrecked me. but its working and shes getting more sleep now, actual deep sleep for large chunks of time that she never got before. its also taking her a lot less time now to go to sleep. i used to have to walk her in a moby wrap to get her to go to sleep and it would take me at least an hour and then she would nurse or need to nurse all night to stay asleep, i could only do that for a year until i just couldnt do it anymore. i am so happy that she is sleeping on her own now you guys dont even know. so hopefully this helps someone see how much work it was and how much crying happened! if anyone wants to know anything just ask me!		/r/Mommit/comments/95s6wx/my_sleep_training_guide_to_help_other_mamas_sleep/	9	6	0	1.0	1533778758.0

i want to finish my degree and be career-focused. i'm currently a sahm. i feel guilty about wanting this. i could use some advice and perspective from other mothers of all ages.	so, here's a tl;dr of my life and situation. was in a long term relationship, got pregnant 4.5 years in at 19, had my baby at 20, and am now 21 with a 14 month old. always thought i wanted a lot of kids, but after having her and her being so, so needy and having a rough pregnancy and giving up so much in the way of my body and youth, i definitely am one and done. i've been doing school on and off, and am starting again next month to get my bs, then want to join the military. my husband i feel very guilty about not loving motherhood as much as other women seem to. i don't hate it, but i feel so bored, tired and sad. i've given up my body and identity to pregnancy and ebfing. i never wanted to be a sahm. i've had to take a backseat and be the primary caregiver the whole time due to being financially bad off and my husband had to work. a lot. and just when he was able to scale back and we were shifting to focus on me and going to school full-time, something bad happened and he had to join the military for a bunch of reasons. blessing in disguise though. now i want that for myself. i want to work. i want to be challenged and make a difference and maybe deploy once or twice. i feel selfish for it. but another part of me says why shouldn't i? why can't i have it all ? my husband can, so why can't i? . i also feel like since i'm younger it'll be easier for me to achieve this. she'll be about 3 at the earliest this happens. she's starting daycare in the next few months so i can have some semblance of a life back, and honestly i can't give her all the stimulation and socialization she needs on my own anyways. i just want advice from moms who feel the same way and what you did and how you made it work, or not. will she be ok? i feel like she should be fine, because she doesn't need me to be there for her all the time, and she will have two involved parents and teachers and activities. she doesn't need me as much as she used to when she was an infant, and when she starts grade school, she'll need me less. of course i mean i don't mean i won't be available emotionally and physically. just like...you know what i mean? i just...i want to give her the best life i can, but i don't want to be miserable either. i want to be happy and fulfilled so i can be a better mom who isn't sad and resentful. i don't want to damage her. i had a horribly abusive mom, and i don't want her to feel unloved or unwanted or hurt by me. my grandmother was a sahm and spent her whole adult life raising her kids and grand kids and can't understand why i'd not want to have babies and be a sahm all my life, so i don't know if she's just a product of her times or if she's right in some aspects . will my daughter be ok? is this ok to want? am i selfish for wanting this, especially given the military context. note i don't mean to knock sahms. i obviously think you are super strong and awesome, but i'm just not cut out for this i don't think. crossposted from r/beyondthebump	imnotpambeesly	/r/Mommit/comments/96cow5/i_want_to_finish_my_degree_and_be_careerfocused/	6	7	0	1.0	1533949999.0
how to help 22 year old son	hey everyone! im new to reddit but my son loves it, so i thought i would give it a try. im 53 and my husband is 61. we have a 22 year old son and a 19 year old daughter im looking for some advice. my son is currently taking classes online and has a year left until he graduates with a bachelors degree. its taken him 5 years. he is a natural born entrepreneur. ever since he was little hes been selling things and starting businesses. right now he has a business hes built over the past two years off of facebook helping people with email marketing. from what hes told me this year alone he has had 150 orders. all this success has been very recent. a year ago we were supporting him almost entirely as he tried to launch a failed app startup. this year hes done $70,000 in sales. he is very good to his dad and i. he takes us out to dinner and buys me wine and his dad a case of beer every week or so. he also invests in the stock market and tells me in the next month or so he will be paying off his student loans. he is extremely generous with his money and loves to spoil us and give gifts growing up he was diagnosed with several hormone deficiencies and a learning disability. after years of struggling with his weight he was first diagnosed at age 9 in the fourth grade. he spent most of his childhood in doctors offices. even today he sees his endocrinologist every 3 months and has his blood taken/tested at least five times a year. hes on 5 different hormones currently. he does all but one by himself. i have to administer one of the injections twice a week. ive always been the only one involved in his medical care. my husband has never been to an appointment or talked to a doctor. i still help him with things like cutting his fingernails and toenails. growing up he struggled with fine motor concepts. hes tried to learn several times but ive been doing it for him his whole life. ive always handled everything for him related to his health/care. i stopped going to doctors appointments with him when he was 21, but i will still go when he needs me. i handle all of the prescriptions and all discussions with the insurance company. my husband and i work at a company that spends an extremely large amount on top of the line health insurance. both him and i are worried about him losing our health insurance when he turns 26 in less than 4 years. especially because he plans on or rather insists on owning his own business. he hasnt had a real job in 4 years since he worked at tj max the summer after his senior year of high school. some of his medications cost thousands of dollars a month without insurance. every now and then i can see his frustrations. he currently lives at home with us in his childhood home. he sleeps in his childhood bedroom. he tells me he feels grown up running his business but feels like a little kid. one of his hormone deficiencies makes him wet the bed almost every night. he takes medication for it, but it doesnt work consistently. we just got back from a two week vacation overseas and he had to wear a diaper every night. what i am concerned with is he has expressed to me he feels really dependent. he feels caught between adulthood and a little kid. we arent sure how to parent him or help him either given all the circumstances. i dont see any clear cut transition to him being an adult and he feels the same way. we have always tried to raise him and his sister the same way so he would have a normal childhood. my daughter has had a near seamless transition	momofa22yearold	/r/Mommit/comments/97s6pm/how_to_help_22_year_old_son/	2	10	0	0.92	1534425360.0

does anyone else hate the finger family song? also, advice wanted!	this is my sons favourite song and some days it is the only song he wants to listen to, he will just cry for everything else. today is one of those days and if i hear daddy finger, daddy finger one more time i feel like i am going to scream! lol. on another note, what is the general consensus of the kid music videos they make on youtube? im a young sahm and these are a godsend for keeping my son distracted when i am trying to cook/clean but not sure how much is recommended? he doesnt just sit and watch tv all day, just plays with toys and it just kind of runs in the background. he only really watches the videos when hes having his bottle. just wanted some opinions and maybe experiences from parents of older children whos babies also watched these kinds of videos. will he end up being dependant and only want to watch tv? thanks in advance!

what are some things you wish you had for you right after having your first baby?	my step-daughter is about to become a new mother is less than 8 weeks! we are all very excited. my husband and i live several states away, but we have made many plans already for gifts and assistance and visits, with daughter's approval of course. she's a young mother, and her in-laws are . . . not great. they have made it clear her value to them is the baby so we have been trying to counter-act that. so what is something nice i could get for her for after the birth to make her feel special and loved? would a home-assembled gift basket be good? i am excellent at those. what should i include if so? i don't have kids of my own so i don't want to accidentally trigger any bad emotions . she's had a hard life so i really want to make this right. any input would be greatly appreciated. i want her to remember that, as much as we love this baby, we love her too. so really good to know that was a good idea. but i'm seeing a majorly strong vote towards comfy clothes and food stuffs, so i'm going to lean into that. amazon prime, netflix, are things i'm going to check if she has as well. my husband had suggested a maid service, but i wasn't sure. but now that someone else brought it up, i will look check into it again . ice packs and phone chargers are amazing ideas that never crossed my mind!!! and lightly scented lotions and things i hadn't thought of as well. good call! y'all, this was really and truly helpful, thank you so much! feel free to leave anything else you think of. i will look into other stuff i didn't mention specifically above as well.

how to deal with wrongful accusation of bullying	my little boy is about to start school and i'm worried that a mom of a girl the same age is going to report him for bullying, so they don't get put in the same class. long story, but this other mom is a real piece of work. it took me a while to realise this because she appears to be so nice on the surface. she cut all ties with one of my best friends, over something trivial . unfortunately, as i didn't take her side, she completely cut me off too which at the time i was upset about, but soon came to realise it was for the best! fast forward to now and i hear on the grapevine that she is going to tell the school principle that her girl is bring bullied so she doesn't want her in the same class as this other kid. my best friend's kid is going to a different school, so i am worried that it's my boy she's going to report, as when we were friends she told me that she was going to do the same thing to another little boy, for the sole reason that she didn't like the mother . so i'm not sure how to go about things now. do i go into the school to tell them it's all lies ? or just let it happen? i don't want them to think my kid is a bully before he even starts. any advise would be much appreciated.	throwaway09468996	/r/Mommit/comments/9a9bxp/how_to_deal_with_wrongful_accusation_of_bullying/	3	2	0	0.76	1535224539.0
my husband told me he felt like throwing our toddler against the wall when he was with the kids today. how do i deal with this?	my husband is usually very kind and patient with our twin toddlers, who are almost 2. they adore him. he loves them very much. they are going through a difficult phase where they cant be left alone for a minute without one hitting or biting the other . also, they have a cough and are more whiny than usual. dh has been busy with work lately and hasnt seen much of the kids this week. i get a scheduled break every saturday morning where he watches the kids and i do whatever. i was in a several mile hike this morning and not available by phone. then i went to the library for some quiet reading. he called, upset that i wasnt reachable, and said he needed help. i was due home in a half hour anyway. so i headed back. when i came in, the kids were awake from their naps quite early, chattering happily in their cribs. he was sitting on the stairs, head in hands, totally overwhelmed. he said that when he went in to get them out of their cribs, they started doing this high pitched scream thing they do for fun, and he was upset and had to leave the room. he said he almost threw one against the wall but stopped himself. he knew it was wrong and did not want to be harsh with his child. wtf do i do with this? how worried do i need to be? do i need to stop taking saturday breaks now, or stay accessible at all times? i have felt so overwhelmed lately, and my scheduled breaks have been my beacon of sanity. but obviously the childs safety comes first. its hard to talk about because no matter how gentle and nonjudgmental i am, he is very sensitive. he has felt upset before and has never hurt our kids, or any kids. i dont know how to handle this.	happybabymama	/r/Mommit/comments/9adovm/my_husband_told_me_he_felt_like_throwing_our/	18	34	0	0.97	1535265678.0
how do i explain my bil's breakup to my 4 year old?	my brother in law was in a relationship with a woman he was preparing to propose to. they dated for maybe 5 years. she broke up with him, so he moved out. the problem is, my daughter used to hang out with them and stay the night etc. she loved to play with exgf. so far the question hasn't come up, but today she asked if we could visit the place where uncle used to be but not anymore . i told her nobody is there anymore and she said but the girl, she there , confidently. when i said we can't visit her, my daughter asked well, can we call her then? matter of factly. when i said no, she asked why. i asked her if i could take some time to figure out the right way to explain to her. so here i am! how do i explain that we can't go see exgf because my bil was completely deviated by the breakup, and he really needs a clean break. moreover, we like her very much, but she's not in our peer group, so i wouldn't consider her to be my friend. i know i need to make it clear that my daughter didn't do anything wrong, i am just stumped as to how! i'm usually very good at verbalizing things, and i know this is a touchy subject. i'm hoping some of you have some experience with this you're willing to share.	ryzzie	/r/Mommit/comments/9ag912/how_do_i_explain_my_bils_breakup_to_my_4_year_old/	5	11	0	0.92	1535296568.0
how do you motivate yourself to workout?	i have a two year old and a 4 month old. my husband commutes 3 hours to work so he leaves very early in the morning and comes home very late at night. by the time he gets back, im just exhausted and all i want to do is lay down. i do take my kids for walks almost every day, but its not enough. i really want to get myself into the habit of working out every day and getting toned, especially after my second baby! i also have terrible eating habits. i dont eat junk food or anything, i just hardly remember to feed myself. i have my cup of coffee in the morning and before i know it, its 4pm and i havent eaten. im sure so many of you relate to this. how do you motivate yourself to get out there and work out or feed yourself?? is there anything you do while youre taking care of the kids that helps? running up and down the stairs? lifting weights while cooking? squats with the baby? help!! 	zumerz	/r/Mommit/comments/9ahpwr/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_workout/	26	8	0	0.8	1535307891.0
dog vs. baby i need advice to stop this rivalry	my husband and i have a 10 year old husky. she was our one and only baby for 10 years and got very spoiled. now that our actual son is here and just learned to crawl, all he wants to do is crawl toward her. in fact when he first learned- she was who he went toward, not me or dad. he adores her. the feeling is not mutual. it's so bad i can't even trust her if my son is within reach. she growls and gives warning snaps if he tries to touch her. she has her own chair that he cannot reach yet and we have made it clear to her that is her baby free zone. but she is stubborn and doesn't always want to move to the chair to get away and then of course baby is determined to get to her since she is within reach and i spend all my time trying to distract him. i'm afraid the constant punishment/warnings/ forcing the dog to be where she doesn't want to is just making the problem worse because she resents baby more and more. i know there is something i can be doing to help the dog adapt, but i just don't know what.

sleep training - i have made a huge mistake and now i don't know how to fix it, send help	my 13 month old goes to bed beautifully at night...right at 7pm, i put him in his crib with a kiss nigh-night , daddy reads him a story, then it's lights out and he's out within 5 minutes, 10 minutes tops. no crying, just talking or singing to himself and then off he goes. it really is miraculous. however, we have a problem. he always wakes up in the night , and refuses to go back to sleep unless we curl up with him in bed - this is where my huge mistake comes in. when we furnished his nursery, since it's a big room we decided to get a regular full-size bed and dresser combo that he would eventually grow into, along with the crib that he's in now. because it's so convenient, when he was really sick around the 8 month mark and woke up congested and/or puking, i would snuggle him in that full-sized bed in his room and more often than not, we'd fall asleep there. well, now he's used to being there at least some of the night. he absolutely won't go back in his crib in the middle of the night and now i fear i've so established this routine that i'm just stuck spending half my night co-sleeping...which is fine, i guess, but is not ideal. am i too far gone? anyone else try to break the co-sleeping habit without cry-it-out? we did some cio but i hated every minute of it and don't relish the idea of trying again. &;	im_here_for_the_cray	/r/Mommit/comments/9d8psf/sleep_training_i_have_made_a_huge_mistake_and_now/	4	7	0	0.9	1536167961.0
how much blood is too much blood during a vaccin?	i am wondering if i saw it worst than it was or if my doctor really was a savage with my baby ? my daughter had her first batch of vaccins this afternoon. i made sure i was breastfeeding while she received her shot as per my midwife recommandation to lower the pain. my doctor said something about getting a reaction before giving the shot but i am not sure what or why. she then proceeded to stab her with the needle and i say stab because that is how i felt/saw it from the corner of my eye. my daughter unlatched right away and i saw panic in her eyes as she started screaming in pain. i turned around to look at my doctor and i swear there was easily a tea spoon of blood on her leg. i asked my doctor why she pushed it so hard, that it felt really rough and she discarted me saying it is how it is done so it doesnt hurt that much... now, i received vaccins before and myself gave insuline shots to an elder woman and i've never seen that much blood after a shot. ive also looked at videos of other doctors giving shot and some babies do not even react if they are breastfeeding. the shot never look that hard even when the baby cries and there just not that much blood. i mean.. she needed to take it off with a kleenex before putting the plaster on, ive never seen that before... is it in my head? if not, what should i do for her next shots? i have to go through my doctor but if she is indeed being a savage, it is just cruel!		/r/Mommit/comments/9ddb0a/how_much_blood_is_too_much_blood_during_a_vaccin/	7	3	0	0.8	1536197139.0
grandparents during labor advice	im pregnant with my first baby and ive dealt with anxiety for most of my life. i really dont want a waiting room full of people while im in labor. the idea of all the grandparents, friends, and extended family sitting there waiting to come in the room really stresses me out. most people are being very cool about that and are willing to stay at home until we let them know its okay to come visit me at the hospital. except the soon to be grandparents. they are adamant that they want to wait at the hospital while im in labor. i really want uninterrupted time after my son is born for me and his father to bond with him. knowing that people are right outside waiting to come in is extremely stressful for me and ill be feeling pressure to let them in as soon as possible. im not sure how long ill want to wait before i let them in and id much rather they wait at home until we tell them to come meet their grandson. theyre saying that they just wont tell me when they get there, but i know that means that theyll come as soon as i tell them were heading to the hospital. i have to tell them when i go into labor because theyll be watching our dog for us for a few days and i do not want to keep it a secret anyway. any suggestions on how to get them to agree? edit theres not really a way to keep it a secret. my sister is going to be there with me and she lives in their house, so theyll know one way or another that something is happening.	daisyhannah1	/r/Mommit/comments/9e93rf/grandparents_during_labor_advice/	47	42	0	0.98	1536454262.0
when was the turning point for you? life after baby	i know a lot of new mothers ask when does it get easier,but honestly.. when was the turning point for you? my baby is 3 months old. this is the hardest thing ive ever been through. when did you feel like yourself again? im trying to give myself until my little girl is a year and just accept that this is really hard and everything sucks until then. i do believe when my daughter is older and more interactive it will be easier than this. i am sure i will find the baby phase the hardest. the needyness and constant attention is very hard for me.	scarlett-88	/r/Mommit/comments/9ecnv4/when_was_the_turning_point_for_you_life_after_baby/	23	7	0	0.83	1536496700.0
i'm not sure if i want to be a mom. how did you decide?	hello. i'm looking for some insight. i have never had any internal inkling to be a mother, yet, now that i'm about to turn 30 i am wondering about motherhood. i don't want to underestimate the amount of joy involved but any time i think about motherhood all i can think about is the work and sacrifice. which, maybe tells me that motherhood isn't for me or perhaps i am not looking at the whole picture. i have little experience around children or mothers so i don't really know what motherhood really entails/looks like. anyway, i am just wondering how the moms on here decided they wanted to be mothers? something tells me it is more of a natural i've always known kind of thing but i really have no idea. any feedback is greatly appreciated thank you!

husband seems to only ever want sex when we're alone	we do have sex roughly three to four times a week. we do have a toddler, so our alone is pretty limited, but most times when we are alone, dh either initiates sex, talks about sex, shows me sexy stuff on reddit, or plays video games by himself. i've brought this up before and told him i feel like he only wants sex when we're alone, and sometimes not even actually alone. when our child is in the back seat of the car awake or asleep , he'll ask me to do sexy things. he also asks me to do sexy things at work and on the rare occasions i go out by myself. when i bring it up, he does acknowledge my feelings and we do other things together a couple nights a week for a few weeks or maybe a couple months. and then it's right back to constant sex. i get that we have less time to have sex now and we used to average once per day. but i feel like now, we are either on full parent mode or full sex mode and there's very little of the friendship that sparked our relationship to begin with. he does have a bit of a higher sex drive than me, but he's also subbed to so many porn reddits that his reddit feed is seventy percent porn. i don't feel right asking him to look at less porn, but this is probably part of it.	babutterfly	/r/Mommit/comments/9faa7z/husband_seems_to_only_ever_want_sex_when_were/	21	27	0	0.92	1536776615.0

what age do you let your kids out without you?	okay so i'm doubting myself here. when i was a kid me and my sister were allowed to go the park after school alone by the age of about 7, we could walk ourselves there and just had to be home when the street lights come on. by 10 we could get the bus down to the town centre for the day and do some shopping with our pocket money, by 13 we were allowed to get the train into the city and go shopping or for meals ect if we had lots of christmas/birthday money to spend. i never really questioned this and if always seemed normal, but it seems on reddit people are still sitting with their kids at the park at like 12? is this normal? i was going to wait untill my daughters 8ish to let her 'play out' unsupervised with friends but now i'm questioning everything. please no judgement i'm just trying to make the right decision, what age did you let your kids out unsupervised, and what age were you out as a child unsupervised?		/r/Mommit/comments/9g39h7/what_age_do_you_let_your_kids_out_without_you/	7	5	0	0.86	1537032429.0

baby has bad diaper rash, any tips?	my little girl seems to be really prone to diaper rash, getting a very light bit of it every few days. we'd been using baby powder but now i'm basically putting destin on every time. we try to check and change her diaper as often as possible minus at night because she's been sleeping through the night lately. the last two days she's had it a little more rough, not widespread but a few really bad spots. then today one was even bleeding a little. i'm trying to be so gentle and she's a real trooper, but when she poops i have to be thorough and no matter how gentle i am it still obviously hurts her. it breaks my heart. any advice on things i can do? we just moved so things are a little frantic. basically if it doesn't heal in a few days i plan on going to an urgent care center since getting to the doc on base might be a bit.

need some advice...	i figured i would post this here because ya'll would know the struggle more with balancing work/home/kids etc. i started my own business/brand about 5 years ago so that i could stay home with my kids. i taught myself everything i needed to know from finding manufacturers, marketing, photography, selling online etc. and it's running really smoothly. my income is continuing to increase, and now that my kids are in school i have extra time. i have friends/family that tell me that all the knowledge that i've collected over the years is really valuable, and i should teach other moms how to do what i do. i am not sure if this is true, or if they are just being encouraging. i see so many people that sign up for mlms that basically look like pyramid schemes, and fail. do you think parents that are looking for money opportunities would take a class on how to start their own legit business? if it were you, would you sign up for something presented this way?	ieatcrayonzs	/r/Mommit/comments/9jo2qy/need_some_advice/	5	17	0	0.9	1538149501.0
here is how our 2 year old handled transitioning from the crib to the toddler bed...	...she was a total pro! &; you guys, i was expecting some kind of crazy week-long struggle with little sleep and no naps. i was expecting crying and yelling and super nanny-esque visits to her room for hours to keep her from climbing out. i expected her to go through all her toys now that she was free from the constraints of a crib. &; naptime we had to remind her which side of the bed to lay on , but other than that, naptime was so easy. we each read her a book and left. she cried because she wanted us to read her dinosaur book, but we told her only three books. so she crawled to the end of her bed and reached underneath to grab the toys we forgot to put away. played with the ambulance for a minute, then the police car for a minute, grabbed a nearby book and read it to herself and then put her head on her pillow and went right to sleep. when she woke up, she just stood in her normal spot on the bed against the back railing and waited for us to get her like she always does. &; bedtime? even better. read her a couple books while she laid down, told her i was turning off the light and leaving, she cried for ten seconds because i wouldn't read anymore books, and then passed out. didn't even try reaching for the books in arm's reach. &; you guys, i'm so freaking proud of this 26 month old little girl of mine. she impressed me so damn much today.		/r/Mommit/comments/9kdeg7/here_is_how_our_2_year_old_handled_transitioning/	5	32	0	0.92	1538369486.0

how to do bedtime when co-sleeping / attachment parenting?	...i started out with every intention of putting the baby in a crib but she simply won't sleep for more than a few minutes if she is not being held, so here we are.... she shares the bed with us, and i get lots and lots of snuggles. i quite like it, the problem i'm having is bedtimes... she tends to fall asleep around 8pm. it'd be easier if i went to bed at that time, but its just too early for me if the baby falls asleep i can't put her down in the bed by herself . so what do you do with the sleeping baby? at the moment i just have the lights down low, and watch tv while she sleeps, then go to bed when i am ready. which sounds fine, until i have to do anything with my hands. i have become very good at doing things one handed, but i feel like this isn't the best way...is there an alternative that i'm not seeing, does anyone else have this routine? &; &; &;	little_sloth_squee	/r/Mommit/comments/9qw8d3/how_to_do_bedtime_when_cosleeping_attachment/	23	33	0	0.88	1540352217.0

 4 year old is struggling with gender	please, no judgement or political nonsense. so, my 4 year old has been saying he is a girl for the last year or so . he was assigned male at birth. he tells me that the clothes i get him aren't right and he prefers toys and shows that are traditionally marketed towards girls. he is relatively happy at home . i'm really struggling with what the appropriate approach is at this age. at home, he can be gender ambiguous and happy. there is no judgement. there is no rush to define or categorize him. outside of home, he already struggles. he got upset and didn't want to continue going to dance class because he didn't get to dress up and they separated boys and girls. he doesn't want to talk to kids that call him a boy. kindergarten is around the corner and i know that there will be lots of gender based questions/processes. the other children will question his gender. i am at such a loss on how to help him with this. i dont know if there is a way to prepare your child for a world that is not generally kind to those who are different. has anyone had similar experiences? how did you help your child embrace themselves and not get downtrodden by societal standards?	eminva02	/r/Mommit/comments/9sp92n/advice_4_year_old_is_struggling_with_gender/	23	6	0	0.71	1540915089.0

advice about books n babies	my 17mo son is so sweet and funny and i love spending time with him, but lately his board books are becoming a big problem for me. hes got a pretty big collection, and he loooves his books . however, he constantly wants us to drop everything and read him an endless queue. he isnt super interested in doing anything else most of the time, and wants us to read the same few books over and over and over. he picks out stacks of them and cuts you off in the middle of one to start another and melts down if you insist on finishing the current book or try to suggest one you havent already read 4 times in the last hour. how do i impose some boundaries with the books without discouraging his interest in them? ive tried enforcing a 3x limit, where ill read him a book 3 times and after that he can read it to himself, but he freaks out and it honestly makes me feel bad. pls halp	akitchenwall	/r/Mommit/comments/9tyjss/advice_about_books_n_babies/	9	6	0	0.81	1541285869.0
9 mo sleep- what am i missing ladies...	my 9 month old daughter is still up 3 times a night and i just dont know if this is just how it is or if there is something i can do better. bedtime is consistent at 7 pm, she gets a total of 11 hours overnight and about 3 hours during the day usually- broken into 2 naps. she nurses for naps but it is separated from bedtime by about half hour or so. we do dinner, nurse, bath, story, song, sleep. she may fuss for a minute or 2 but goes down really well and settles herself fairly easily at bedtime and naptimes. the problem is that despite the sleep training and good sleep habits i've been working on for months,she is still up every 2 to 3 hours or so overnight. i try to let her settle herself if she wakes up and sometimes she does and sometimes she doesn't -i usually go in if it takes longer than 20 to 30 mins in the middle of the night, depending on whether she is disturbing my son, how long it has been since her last wake up and how close to getting up time it is but she is more consistent with not settling than she is with actually settling in the night time. i feel like i'm doing it right but it's just not working. is this just my life now? any advice or experiences are helpful. edit a lot of good suggestions and overall reassurance that i'm not alone in this and that it is fairly normal. thanks everyone! going to sleep now, for a few hours before i get to snuggle my baby girl for the first of many times tonight. 3 isn't so bad. i remember 6 wakings a few months ago. could be worse.

am i the only one who feels weird about feeding my baby pured meat?	so my baby is 8 months old and finally starting to enjoy baby food! we have been trying since 5 1/2 months to get him to eat and up until recently he has had disdain for anything that isnt some form of sweet potato or banana. lately ive been reading about introducing meats. first of all, i have been vegetarian and vegan in the past, during my pregnancy and now while breastfeeding i have been eating meat and dairy so im not really on either side of the fence right now. i have thought about raising my son to be vegetarian, and then later as he gets older he can decide for himself if thats a lifestyle he would like to continue, or change. secondly, every time im in the baby food aisle and i see canned pured meat i feel so grossed out. i mean the color of those things alone is enough to steer me away. its so unnatural looking. thirdly, how necessary is meat in their diet really? the whole concept of feeding a baby meat just seems bizarre to me but maybe thats my years of vegetarian/veganism getting the better of me. i mean meat truly is u healthy, even if you do eat meat you have to acknowledge that a diet with meat is flawed at best. so i guess my question is, where do you stand on feeding meat to your child? if you do, what kind and how often? canned or fresh? i guess im just looking for opinions. tldr do you feed your baby meat, what kind? why?

8mth old sleeps ~8hrs straight. how can i help her make it to 10?	she goes to daycare and doesnt nap well there. i pick her up around 4 and she is exhausted. she cannot make it past 6pm for bedtime. weve tried to push it but shes miserable. she wakes up ~2am, but is barely feeding. she goes to back to sleep directly afterward and usually wakes ~5am with the same routine . i know i should be happy with this- its 8 hours! thats great!....but its not ideal. 1 she has made it from 6pm-5am several times but i cannot figure out the magic variable when this happens. 2 shes barely feeding which gives me the impression she is just waking out of habit and 3 im freggin tired and am dying for longer stretches for myself! ive tried to let her cry it out. but she goes for an hour with no signs of slowing! call me weak, but at that point i need to address it and get back to sleep myself . any constructive feedback or advice? she is breast and formula fed.	dasnahce	/r/Mommit/comments/9xifgz/8mth_old_sleeps_8hrs_straight_how_can_i_help_her/	25	5	0	0.73	1542339039.0

mothers discuss the challenge of talking about child sexual abuse prevention within the family and community	a recent piece of research demonstrated that mothers needed to take four steps to get to the point where they were able to take action to reduce risks 1. increasing understanding about abuse, how and where it happens. 2. accepting the possibility of abuse at home and in the family. 3. accurately assessing the risks posed to ones own children. 4. lowering known risks by negotiating with family members. importantly, mothers faced challenges they needed to overcome to take each step. some were able to overcome those challenges, and some were not. here are some of the things mothers said i knew child sexual abuse could happen, and i had heard stories of it happening. i believed it could happen, but i didnt want to believe it could happen. i didnt want to put it in my head; you dont want to believe it could happen to you. my brother is allowed to bring friends into the house, but not when he is looking after my children. i told him directly that i was forbidding him from bringing his friends over because i dont want anyone to sexually abuse my children; and that if he was distracted, e.g. making food or on the toilet, anything could happen. he tells me i am paranoid and that i am sick in the head. i tell him that its a cruel world out there. i'd be interested to hear from mothers about their own experiences when they have been concerned to make the environment safer for their children, whether at home or in spaces and places where their children play and stay. have you ever wanted to broach the topic of sexual abuse prevention and safety? how easy was it to have that discussion? what was the outcome?

what could be the reason for my boy to feel low about himself?	do your boys have any confidence issues? what could be the reason for it? &; i've got some problem with my son lately. i'll try to explain it here. sorry that it seems like a bit long... &; my son is turning 13 very soon. he's never had much serious issues so far. what happened recently was that, after a dental check, the dentist said that he's not been brushing his teeth the correct way and so his gums are a bit swollen. he has to brush better from now on or his gums will get worse. &; so then i started to brush with him everyday to make sure he brush the correct way. i would stand beside him, and i brush my teeth and he brush his so i can see how he's brushing and show him how to brush. he's brushing a little bit better, but still not good enough. when i'm beside him and tell him to brush more in a circular motion and reach the gum area, he just keep on saying i'm already doing it ... while from what i can see, he's mostly just brushing horizontally instead of brushing in circular motion so can reach a larger brushing area and reach the gum line. &; his attitude is like, he doesn't want to accept my suggestions of brushing in a better way, he thinks he is already doing it right, and he doesn't want to change for the better. &; every time i tell him how to brush better, he just keep on saying i'm already... and doesn't change his way of brushing at all. &; in the end i just decided to try to give him some consequences for not willing to improve his way of brushing. i actually have never gave him any consequences in the past. this is something new for us. recently i have also given him some consequences for not finishing school work on time. so all these consequences only started from like a week ago. &; but i didn't expect that the method of giving him consequences would make him feel bad about himself. he was crying last night and saying, i'm making him feel like he's a failure and not able to do anything well. and then he kept on saying a lot of things like how he doesn't feel good about himself. he thinks he's not smart, he's not strong, and he's not normal, nobody care or like him. &; i was very surprised to hear him saying all that. because he's always been happy most of the times. i'm showing him lots of affections all the times, and he tells me that he loves me quite often as well. at school he's got a big circle of good friends. and all his grades are pretty good as well. there is no reason at all that he would feel so low about himself. &; so i asked him if anybody at school has said bad things to him, or has pushed him or hit him. he said no. only that he thinks the way other kids look at him make him feel like he's not normal. so after i hear that, it seems to me that he's making up all the bad feelings about himself in his own mind. somehow he doesn't feel confident about himself inside, so he just suspect that other kids are looking at him in an abnormal way. &; my son is not actually the outgoing type. i think he's got a bit shy type of personality. i don't think he is extremly shy because he's always playing with all his friends at school and after school. he told me that he often helps his classmates with math problems as well. but he sure is not very outgoing type and sometimes when he's walking he could seem a bit awkward like bending his back forward... well most times when he's walking he's not carrying himself in a very confident way. but it didn't seem like a serious problem because i can see when his friends interact with him, they seem to like him a lot. he even said that one of his friends said that he is the only person this friend of his would fully trust among all other friends. so looks like he's a naturally trustworthy person in other kids' eyes. &; so everything is going well, at home he's got lots of love and encouragements, at school all the kids like him. there is no obvious reason that he would think low of himself. &; i'm guessing the reason might be in his personality? maybe he does have a shy part in his personality, so he's not overly confident about himself. i know that some very shy person would often suspect that other people around him don't like them. when people standing near them and chatting and laughing, the shy person might think that those people are talking about him and laughing at him, which in reality would not be the truth. but they often think that way in their own minds. &; if that's the case for my son, is there anyway to improve it?	kekehuang	/r/Mommit/comments/a2ix5y/what_could_be_the_reason_for_my_boy_to_feel_low/	9	1	0	0.6	1543795341.0

i need some perspective on my 'clingy' toddler. please help!	i really need help. i'm reaching breaking point and i don't know what to do anymore if anything. &; so my son is 17 months. he was always very independent until he turned one and now it is just getting silly. all day long all my son wants to do is take me by the hand and lead me around the house or get me to pick him up. i am not exaggerating when i say this is absolutely all day long. he becomes upset very easily if i don't react immediately. he won't play because if i try to play with him he will for a couple of minutes then try and lead me away again. he will play with his dad. he has just started nursery and at the moment it's made it worse. he is finding it tough there but it is only a couple of mornings a week. i've always had to cuddle him to sleep which can take up to an hour. now he often wakes up when i put him down in his cot and he panics and becomes hysterical. my husband and i are still up multiple times in the night. &; i thought i would just ride it out until he gets over it but it's been 6 months now. is this even normal? is this a bit extreme? i need to do something. my mental health is really starting to suffer but then maybe i should just wait it out. i just don't want to do the wrong thing. &; any advice would be really really appreciated. &; &;	physicsgurl87	/r/Mommit/comments/a3ru5c/i_need_some_perspective_on_my_clingy_toddler/	2	3	0	0.81	1544127583.0

what are your best methods for getting rid of gas for babies?	hey mommas! my baby just turned 4 months today and ive managed to get rid of his gas before but i dont really have any great methods. luckily he doesnt get painful gas too often. i should mention that he is currently formula fed and has been on the same formula for a while now. but just an hour ago, he was in a deep sleep and woke up screaming. i thought maybe it was a bad dream but then realized it was gas. i always pat/rub his back to get any burps out. ive also used gripe water , bicycle kicks, gently rubbing his belly in circular motions, lay him on his belly or side, etc. is there any other suggestions or methods that have worked for you?	misscoco11	/r/Mommit/comments/a5re61/what_are_your_best_methods_for_getting_rid_of_gas/	33	18	0	1.0	1544686436.0
what age to update floors	so, we moved into our long term house about 18 months ago. it is filled with a fun mixed bag of yucky floor. they're honestly fine i suppose, the previous home owners had been here almost 40 years and put new, cheapest carpet in a light neutral color per their realtors recommendation throughout. it's obviously cheap and not holding up. it's nearly white and would be challenging with dh let alone little kids. it's a weird multilevel/sprawled out ranch you're home, our long term plans would be hardwood in kitchen/living/dining area and probably a tile or nicer laminate for our rec room area i've been holding out because our kids are 1 and 3. my original thought was carpet was nicer for when youngest was crawling and learning to walk. we're fortunately past that now . but i'm trying to decide what age is reasonable to think they won't trash my nice floors. i honestly think they'd be fine now, the biggest nuisance we seem to get is spilled sippy cups, which is really gross and annoying with carpet. does it get worse again? thoughts/experiences?	tiner88	/r/Mommit/comments/a60gia/what_age_to_update_floors/	10	11	0	1.0	1544754084.0
recommendations for parenting books or advice	so my daughter whose 6 started kindergarten in this past fall, and it's been kind of a nightmare. she doesn't get along well with the other kids, she thinks that them just looking at her is an act of aggression. she lashes out/throws tantrums/disrupts the class. we've had to go pick her up twice from school and she's already been suspended for a day after hitting. we were hoping to get suggestions for books that may have helped you with learning the best way to discipline your kids, or books for dealing with kids with high anxiety. we have an appointment to meet with a child therapist for an assessment but that isn't until mid january but we need to see some improvement soon because waiting for her school to call everyday is killing us with stress. thanks fellow moms	kittysue804	/r/Mommit/comments/a65v3x/recommendations_for_parenting_books_or_advice/	15	8	0	1.0	1544801984.0

advice on transitioning from co-sleeping to crib.	hello all! i have a 16 month old who has been co-sleeping since 2 months. we love co-sleeping but he takes up so much room that my fianc has to sleep on the couch most nights. its taken a serious toll on our relationship. my fianc is feeling neglected and like he is an outsider in his own bed, so weve made the decision that our son needs to move to his crib . im nervous to start the transition but its our only option at this point. so im looking for advice on making the transition easier. our bedtime routine is, read a book, night-night bottle, and then rocking to sleep. after i rock him i take him to our bedroom and lay down and we both go to sleep. the plan is to continue the routine but lay him in his crib instead of the bed. if anyone has any input or advice i would love to hear it! he is also currently taking his naps on the couch with me close by. he is very much a spoiled mamas boy. thank you!	ouchitforrealburns	/r/Mommit/comments/a7p5cx/advice_on_transitioning_from_cosleeping_to_crib/	3	2	0	1.0	1545244617.0

advice for divorced mom looking to spend more time with daughter ?	hello everyone, my daughter spends more time with her dad at their house, and i've been playing an online game called roblox with her. for those not familiar with it, it's a website where they have a bunch of mini-games that you can play. sometimes my daughter is able to use her dads or step moms phone to talk to me while we play, but sometimes we just have to use the text chat in-game. i've considered buying her a cheap phone to use at her dads house. i have an old iphone and i was wondering if maybe we could use that to communicate , or if i should just buy her a cheap phone. i am trying to think of other ways we can spend time together, too. she likes minecraft that we play at my house, but she doesn't have the game at her dad's house, and i do not know how we would set up a server we could play on. maybe this is the wrong sub, but i'm very glad to be able to spend this time with her, even if it's playing kids games. i know her dad thinks it's stupid but to me it's not a waste of my time. any ideas appreciated thank you.	chiquitabrilliant	/r/Mommit/comments/aa0d66/advice_for_divorced_mom_looking_to_spend_more/	6	2	0	1.0	1545926418.0
people who write about how tobget picky eaters to eat, have not encountered real picky eaters.	i want to start with that my daughter is nine and she's only a picky eater around the people who enable her habits. she's actually really good at trying new things. lately her father hasn't been helpful when getting her to eat. so she's basically reverted back to her old habits. which lead me to look up some creative ways to help her get her daily nutrition. first off, green foods are definitely not going to help a picky eater eat. i can't say how many recipes claim to be with kids that are green. kale muffins, spinach cookies, zucchini noodles. i just think it's so hilarious. also, what picky kid is going to eat anything made with cauliflower unless it is heavily disguised? like as a sauce. i understand there are many different ways a kid can be picky. like, my daughter will eat bell peppers cold, but if there is big chunks in her warm food, she will pick at it. but c'mon, half the stuff on pinterest or google wouldn't work for most picky eaters.

ever think about what toddler mood swings must feel like to the toddler?	i found myself really feeling for my 17 month old just now, more so than usual, as she was moodier than usual. she had been out and about with my husband during her usual naptime and then came back and didn't seem to have any use for a nap until about 4 30, when i put her down for an hour. woke her up at 5 30 and the. kid. was. a. mess. she played for a few minutes, then refused to eat any dinner, then cried hysterically, then enjoyed a few dances with me to her favorite songs, then cried hysterically, then asked to be put into her high chair before once again refusing to eat and crying hysterically, clung to my legs and cried hysterically into my knees, sat on my lap and cried hysterically while watching shrek, played in the tub happily for less than 10 minutes before beginning to cry hysterically again... while i was dressing her in her pj's she was literally alternating in 30 second increments between playing a silly game of making her toy talk in a high pitched voice with me and crying. &; that feels shitty enough from my perspective, when i think about what all that emotion must feel like from her side... just... wow. poor thing. &; she's asleep but didn't eat any dinner so i'm steeling myself for a night wakeup and trying to figure out what the hell to do about that.		/r/Mommit/comments/aaqxyr/ever_think_about_what_toddler_mood_swings_must/	2	18	0	0.92	1546130572.0

i need some breastfeeding advice/support.	i am feeling overwhelmed. ive always had an extreme aversion to anyone touching my nipples so i was wary about breastfeeding before i started. im breastfeeding my son who is 7 weeks old and it has always hurt. mostly when he first latches. ive been to 7 lactation consultant appointments with three different lactation peeps and they say his latch is, okay, not great. he doesnt open his mouth very wide. hes getting plenty of milk though. he can drain me quick. its very painful when he first latches and then it moves to uncomfortable and pinchy for the remainder of the feed. pumping was also extraordinarily painful when i first started, but is getting to the point where its simply uncomfortable. i bought, the art of breastfeeding, published by the la lethe league, which recommended the laid back position so he could find the nipple/latch on his own. its a game changer in terms of his anxiety when eating as he starts and stops at his own pace rather than forcing him because im shoving a breast in his face repeatedly . but its made it even harder to get him to open his mouth wide and it hurts just as much. im going to my first lll meaning this morning. i used nipple guards until a week ago, i dont have thrush, and though i had a bout with cracked/nipples, my nips are fine now. i take ibuprofen and tylenol to deal with the pain. im tired ladies. my biggest question is whether there is a healthy amount of pain/discomfort when breastfeeding for anyone? i pump sometimes in between feedings just to give my nips a break between feedings but i dont know how much longer i can do this and keep my sanity. i so want to breastfeed. any advice on different positions, crazy latch strategies, and personal stories i very much welcome. i am incredibly curious about the amount of pain/discomfort other women experience when breastfeeding. i keep reading/being told that it shouldnt hurt but then im being told his latch is fine, he doesnt have a tongue tie, and im setting up the pump properly with the right sized flanges. apparently, im doing everything right, but oh my god it still hurts. am i hurting myself and my sanity by continuing?	rorhan	/r/Mommit/comments/acinot/i_need_some_breastfeeding_advicesupport/	28	3	0	1.0	1546612180.0

how to feed a picky eater	i've been googling lunch/dinner ideas for toddlers. but honestly, i'm looking at these things and wondering how the heck there are toddlers eating hummus or lettuce or carrots, soups, chicken, etc. my 2 year girl will not even try new things unless it looks like another food she knows she likes. she has been super picky about food since she started on solids. thankfully the foods she likes are almost all healthy. and i'm not concerned so much as i really just want to encourage her to try more and to get to the point where she'll eat what we're eating at dinner. i'm fully aware that this is not a horrible problem to be having. just looking for ideas. breakfast is easy. she loves baby oatmeal, raspberries, blueberries, cheerios , and eggs . sometimes she'll eat bites of toast. she'll eat cheese, crackers, peanut butter on crackers , corn , peas sometimes, 1 green bean, mashed potatoes, salmon, steak, turkey , beans, french fries, tortilla chips, gingerbread cookies, goldfish, graham crackers pretzels . and she loves the plum brand metoddler pouches. i've tried sneaking cauliflower in the mashed potatoes. i've tried other things in mashed potatoes but if it's a different color she won't try. sometimes she'll surprise me and eat a chicken nugget. or part of a quesadilla. i can't mix together several things she likes. i still make most of our dinners toddler friendly in the off chance she'll try and like it. some nights dinner for her is what we're eating and i make sure there's at least 1 thing on the plate she likes. and that usually ends up being all she eats until breakfast . and she seems fine with that. doesn't ask for food, doesn't get grumpy, doesn't wake at night. and even with the foods she does like she goes on breaks and won't eat them.

i need advice about unusual bathroom behavior and personal space in 4 year old	hey mamas, i could use some advice about what i can do to help my four year old step son. hes been potty trained for a good while now, no daytime or nighttime accidents in months! however, recently he started wetting the bed frequently . about the same time he mentioned to me that he had seen an image of a girl getting poked in the butt with a pokey. at the time i didnt ask further about that. over a week later, he brought this up to me again, and when i asked a few questions he told me he saw the image on his moms computer while watching a movie, and the girl was naked. step-sons dad talked to bm about it, and it was the first she had heard of it but she said it probably happened while he was watching youtube videos. step-son went to bms house for the week, and came back yesterday. she let us know that he has been having poop accidents during the day, at daycare and at home. on top of all this, step-son used to be very snuggly but over the last month or so has be insisting he didnt want to be touched or kissed. if just one of these elements was going on i would be less concerned, but with all of them together i worry about a bigger issue... does anyone have any advice for me? should i talk to our pediatrician about it? thanks in advance		/r/Mommit/comments/afwidu/i_need_advice_about_unusual_bathroom_behavior_and/	20	30	0	0.92	1547477486.0
never realized how isolating postpartum is	im 2 months pp and just need to get off of my chest how alone i feel in motherhood. as beautiful and addicting as my baby and our time together is, my partner is having such a hard time understanding how my hormones effect my day to day wellbeing and patience and overall happiness. weve been struggling so much since baby came being that postpartum depression hit me pretty hard and my attitude has been less than kind or patient with him. every stressed out response i give him or irritated tone i give is met with so much overreaction and hardly ever any understanding or sympathy. he constantly sees me as his enemy rather than a new mom who worries and stresses and gets upset and its becoming overwhelming. its so frustrating because he just simply doesnt get what this is like; what the constant worry is like, what the exhaustion with breastfeeding is like, he doesnt experience these emotions. i know having mom friends would be good for me and being around female energy is something im seriously lacking but other moms are so hard to relate to. im convinced that dad doesnt truly bond with baby until baby becomes a bit more independent of me, dad hardly even holds baby or feels comfortable being alone with him because baby tends to cry right away being that dad doesnt fully understand his cues or what he likes. on top of the typical anxiety and stress of being a new mother i constantly worry when babys alone with dad. not that hes incompetent or careless, he loves our son every bit as much as i do, he just seems to have less patience and is not as attentive as i am. lately he seems to just want to bring baby to the nanny when im gone, i can tell babys discomfort with him is giving him a lot of anxiety. i dont know what to do to help dad feel better around baby and also to stop breathing down dads neck every time hes alone with little one. i feel like im going crazy waiting for something terrible to happen when im at work during the day. really struggling here.	brightblueorb	/r/Mommit/comments/afyl5n/never_realized_how_isolating_postpartum_is/	68	182	0	0.97	1547489824.0
so, when do i sleep?	hi, i've been lurking but this is my first post here. sahm here, my first lo is eight weeks today and i'm having trouble with time management. i'm doing it all mostly on my own, i don't have friends or family to lean on, and my husband does everything he can, but he's a teacher, he has a 45-minute commute, and he doesn't lactate, so there's only so much he can do. we agree that his sleep schedule is a high priority otherwise his commute becomes dangerous. mornings, dd wants to eat so frequently that trying to sleep is useless. afternoons. yay, i can finally brush my teeth and empty the dishwasher, maybe, if dd isn't being fussy today. if she's not fussy, and if there isn't something important needing to get done, maybe i can nap. but if i do, sleep inertia makes me feel crappy when i wake up. evenings. this is the only chunk of time for some real human interaction. my sanity needs me to eat dinner with my husband, watch tv with him, and find joy in seeing him bond with the baby, so i can't nap in the evening. on days i exercise , it's in the evening. nights. although she can go four hours between feeds during the day, it rarely happens at night. i'm still trying to streamline my night feedings, but she has reflux. it goes diaper change, nurse, burp, upright for 30 minutes, all told i'm up for around 50 minutes, more if she doesn't accept her bassinet. i try to go to bed earlier, but dd is the boss and she usually says no, and when she doesn't, sometimes i can't fall asleep before 11pm anyways, must be overtired? weekends dh helps me catch up on sleep, so that helps lot. it's all temporary and it'll get easier as she starts to go longer between feeds and her reflux improves, but in the meantime, i'm looking for ways to optimize my time. up until now i've set low standards for getting things done, but i can't anymore. i need a couple hours to get things done in the afternoon, and i need more sleep. any idea where i can find it?

giving advice or mom shaming?	i've been wondering where the line is between giving advice or pointing out potentially bad parenting and mom shaming. i suppose it has a lot to do with how it's presented. there's obviously a difference between being helpful and being condescending, but is it better to butt out all together or not? i'll give an example of something i wanted to say something about but didn't because i didn't want to come off as a sanctimommy. my husband's cousin shares a post on facebook that was a picture of a baby, maybe a year old, eating fries with a sign that said breastfeed or formula fed, all babies are fry fed and the caption she wrote with it was so true my son loves his fries and nuggets. her son is 10 months old. about 3 weeks older than my daughter. i wouldn't never think to give my baby nuggets. aside from it being junk food, i worry about a choking hazard. i feel like food like that should wait till they have molars. am i wrong about that? i'm not a snob when it comes to what you feed your child. i don't have anything against junk food occasionally. i know i plan to avoid it, but i think all moms do then life happens and you give in. it's no big deal, but i can't believe it's a good idea to give 10 month old chicken nuggets. if i had said something, would i have been out of line, or would it have been acceptable? when does it become sanctimommy behavior to criticize how others parent? edit; okay so i just to point out that i wasn't asking if i should say something in the example that i made and it was probably a bad example because as some have pointed that nuggets are not a choking hazard, so maybe a better example would be hot dogs that are not cut properly. i guess i'm just wondering when. it's okay to say something. is it only when there's immediate danger or is it okay to say something about potentially dangerous situations that may not present an immediate threat. like foods that are a choking hazard or maybe putting stuffed animals in a crib or something along those lines.

7yo daughter among group of children sent to counseling office for not letting other kids play with them. the main culprit is another child who seems to be hurtfully manipulating my child and others into this behavior. what else can i be doing?	this year my daughter has become seemingly obsessed with another girl in her class, well call her ashley. for months now, my daughter has had issues with this girl, and it finally culminated into her, possibly ashley, and other kids going to the counseling office to discuss this. my daughter has another friend well call emma. my daughter plays mostly with ashley and emma. emma is a sweet girl but the dynamic between my daughter, ashley and emma has gotten more and more problematic. ashley gets upset when she feels like my daughter is stealing emma from her. my daughter gets upset when ashley and emma seem to be bonding more, or when they play together and my daughter feels left out. im trying to explain this the best i can but its very confusing for me! i feel like i cant get a clear explanation about whats happening. both my daughter and emma often talk about ashley getting mad at them for playing with other kids besides her. ashley gets really possessive. the hard part is that my daughter cares a lot about what ashley thinks of her. she gets upset when ashley is mad at her or threatens not to be her best friend anymore. if ashley doesnt like someone, my daughter isnt allowed to play with them. my daughter has lied to ashley about playing with other kids, or has told ashley things like i was only playing with them to spy on them, to keep her from getting mad at her for playing with someone else. my daughter will come home and say things like, i really like jenny but ashley doesnt so i cant let her know that i like jenny. my daughter talks about being on ashleys friend team and so-and-so cant be on it. my daughter clearly doesnt like this but also doesnt like the idea of ashley not liking her. she becomes distraught by the thought of ashley getting mad at her and will do almost anything to keep ashley happy with her. this ashley situation is turning my daughter into someone i dont recognize. emmas mom and i talked last night and she said the same thing about emma, a really sweet girl who has suddenly become obsessed over ashley. emma and my daughter have both started engaging in behaviors where theyre leaving kids out because ashley doesnt want them in. its like ashley has these two little girls wrapped around her finger. recently i let my daughter connect with ashley via her facetime account on her ipad. my daughter isnt on her ipad very much, and when ashley calls and my daughter doesnt pick up, ill see texts later on her ipad like why arent you picking up its making me sad! ive told my daughter that your friends dont control you. theyre happy for you when youre spending time with your family and are patient. they want to meet your friends and dont want to exclude them. they dont tell you when and where you should go or who you can and cant be friends with. if a relationship hurts or makes you worry more than it feels good, its not a healthy relationship and you deserve better. based on everything ive observed, ashley and her sister dont have a lot of limitations at home. ive met their mom, though, and i really like her a lot and shes a sweet woman, so i have no idea what to make of their home life compared to what i got from meeting their mom. ive talked to my daughter multiple times about this. negative interactions at school with ashley can make my daughter meltdown at home and feel sick before having to go to school the next day. ive been trying to find a balance between having talks with my daughter where i just listen and ask her what shes doing about the situation, versus just giving straight advice. ive gone between trying to just let them work it out naturally and stay calm about it all, not helicopter, and considering reaching out to the teacher for help understanding what is going on. my daughter tends to not talk about the relationship in a very linear way. sometimes she gets mad when i ask her questions, as if shes told me something and i didnt hear it, and shes frustrated as if im not listening to her, but i simply dont understand what shes telling me no matter how hard i try. the only thing i understand is that this ashley is controlling and really having an impact on essentially the friend-politics of the class. what else can i be doing to get my daughter to drop this girl or teach her how to be more inclusive? she worries so much about what she thinks. ive observed them together and from my viewpoint nothing seems weird until my daughter gets upset. i also encourage my daughter to play with her other friends, which she does when ashley isnt around, and i can tell they make her so much happier. anything else i can try? i may be writing to the teacher soon for help.	franticshouting	/r/Mommit/comments/ajo26x/7yo_daughter_among_group_of_children_sent_to/	4	3	0	1.0	1548415138.0

need suggestions of how to help my sweet struggling neighbor	hello fellow moms! a neighbor let me know the other day what a rough season she is in right now and i want to help her. she has a teen, a toddler, a newborn, and a brand new puppy. her husband is away working overseas for weeks at a time, and is gone for at least another week. the baby is up all night nursing right now and the puppy is not taking kindly to kennel training and is keeping her up the rest of the night. my child is similar age to her oldest but her son attends school across town and not the neighborhood school mine attends or i would at least take over school transport for her. we have been friendly for years but not necessarily close like i feel like i can come in and take on some of her burden as i would with a close friend. i want to help though, and am home all day and so able to do anything. unfortunately, their diet is super special so i dont think i can even take on meals for them. any ideas? i am certain some of you have been in both our shoes and can give me ideas. tia!

my son is nearly seven and every day, almost everything is still a battle. i'm on the verge of screaming and breaking down. i need help.	well, pretty much what the title says. brushing his teeth, eating, dressing up, doing his homework, getting out of bed, washing his hands after he uses the bathroom... i have to ask him to do it multiple times, i ask normally, i tell him why he should, i tell him how he could get sick if he didn't wash his hands, i tell him we only have so much time before it's time to leave for school. i repeat myself three or four times and then after i have literally said the same sentence to him ten times in the space of 15 minutes i lose my cool. i'm a single mom and found work with a lot of difficulty. i manage a lot of things and am happy to do so. but i don't think its unreasonable for a 7 year old to be able to wash his hands or brush his teeth without it being a battle royale. what is making it very stressful is that he argues with me. for ex he holds his pee in till the last minute when he gets desperate and has to go right now. i have told him so many times for years why he needs to get up and use the bathroom when he wakes up or before we go out but he will insist that whatever he is doing right now is important. when he comes from playing i ask him to wash his hands, because i want to serve him his dinner and he wont because of something - needs to read - turn on the tv - something. and then it becomes an argument where i insist he needs to wash his hands and he won't for his reasons. i mean, i know i can't expect a 7 year old to behave all the time... but he is just about 7 and am i unreasonable for him to just wash his hands or brush his teeth without it become a huge battle? what can i do? i read to him and explain diseases and hygiene but he argues back that he wont get sick or whatever. i'm just so tired of having to repeat myself everyday... it's years now. i want to cry. does anyone have any tips on how i should talk to him or books or something? i'd appreciate it. &;	parent_need_help	/r/Mommit/comments/amacf4/my_son_is_nearly_seven_and_every_day_almost/	12	8	0	1.0	1549078738.0

advice needed on how to discuss inevitable death with a small child	first time poster but my mind is a bit on the fritz and google wasn't much help. my father in law was unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 4 terminal cancer and is given 1 month to 1 year. we are obviously devastated however my biggest concern at this time is how to prepare our 3, almost 4 year old. they are extremely close and have spent every monday together since our little was born. in hindsight we have done a disservice to the situation by hiding death and he really has no idea what it even is. i've begun telling him that papa is not feeling well and that daddy's heart is sad and we have so far shielded him from the emotions of it. i do believe it is fair to discuss with him bits at a time however i'm struggling with how to go about it in a way that he can understand, while also teaching him a healthy way to cope. i understand there is no easy way but i would love some feedback from anyone that has had a similar situation.	shleytothed	/r/Mommit/comments/ap6ef4/advice_needed_on_how_to_discuss_inevitable_death/	15	22	0	1.0	1549821626.0

that's not where dirty diapers go dh....	i originally posted this in another sub and i figured i'd post it here as well. y'all, i can't even make this ish up. this has got to be one of the grossest things i've ever dealt with, and i've taken care of patients with c. diff so that's saying something. earlier today i was changing my son's diaper- he had brewed some foul beef stew. i sealed up the package of toxic waste and handed it to dh, who was providing moral support he drops the diaper in what i assume was the diaper pail. we move on with our lives. later, after the kiddo went to bed, i dragged his laundry hamper downstairs to wash his clothes, then went upstairs to enjoy some wine and tv because solo-mama-time is rare in this house. after two episodes of handmaid's tale i went to move the clothes into the dryer. with two hands i reached in and grabbed a sopping wet package of chocolate surprise. dh had somehow lost his brain and put the diaper in the laundry hamper instead of the heavy duty receptacle we paid $40 for and use every damn day. how do i even move on from here? do i rewash the clothes? do i throw the clothes out? do i throw the whole husband out?? yes, i know i'm overreacting and after the initial shock and confusion i had a good laugh about it. but i did pour myself another glass of wine. happy valentine's day mamas, i hope my story brought a little humor to your evenings.

how do sahms who also work do it all without childcare?	tldr i'm looking for some strategies for how to better balance home and work while trying not to ignore my very active 20 month old. update i really appreciate all the responses. i think i was really suffering from a lack of perspective. i was feeling guilty for all the time i took for myself to eat, sleep, or take care of myself in any way. i don't think that is any way to live and i don't think the other moms i have been so jealous of are making that level of sacrifice to do what they do. no matter what you do, a day still has the same number of hours. i'm realizing that in order to be able to be a good mom i have to do things differently than i did before my son was born. i can't ignore my own needs the same way and be able to be a good mom to him. i also recently discovered that two of the moms i was the most in awe of for their balance of self-care, work, personal business, and stay-at-home mom duties have a few secrets up their sleeves. both of them rely heavily on their mothers and nearby family to watch their kids and to help with household tasks for up to 8-12 hours a day during weekdays. their husbands often take some evenings and weekends. they've both also cut back from working full-time at their jobs to no more than 20 hours a week. they aren't still breastfeeding, which i have no judgement about, but it has a very different time requirement. they also have babysitters they use for times their parents are unavailable. my parents, would freak out if i needed to rely on them so much for childcare . it appears that in other families it is just a given or expectation that grandparents will watch the littles and that they volunteer to do so. it is unclear whether these other moms i know were deliberately keeping it on the down low that they got so much help from their parents or if they really just didn't consider it childcare , help , or anything out of the ordinary. maybe they're trying to maintain the illusion that they are able to have it all ...and if so, props, because they are pretty good at it! ladies, especially fellow mommies, take heed do not fall into the trap of believing what you see posted on social media. it's hard because you want to believe what you see, but you aren't seeing it all. there is often so much going on behind the curtain. we're all struggling. motherhood is challenging no matter what your life circumstances. there is so much talk about how moms need to stop judging each other. forget that, for the moment. first, we have to stop judging ourselves as mothers. i'm taking steps to be more bold about my own needs and practicing asking for what i need, even if those requests aren't always answered. unfortunately for my husband, this also means asking him to do all that he can, even if he didn't do it well the previous time and/or hated having to do it. so far i seem to be repeating myself a lot and mostly being a cheerleader to convince him to keep tackling things he isn't automatically the best at. it's hard not to let him off the hook when i see how frustrated and unhappy he is with a task, but i am trying to approach it the way i would with my toddler. just like my son, i don't want my husband to get the impression that i think he is helpless or incapable. the only way i know to teach him is to let him flail around and figure it out on his own. unpleasant for all, but necessary. original post i know comparing yourself to others is a dangerous game, but i can't help it. i did not really have local friends before becoming a mom and now i see little hope of that. as a result, much of what i see is on social media. i have fb friends that work full-time from home during the week and run their own businesses on the weekends. they do not have nannies or send their littles to preschool. their husbands also work at least part-time or even full-time. i cannot for the life of me figure out how this is possible. even with a couple hours of grandparent help a week, i'm in over my head. it was slightly more manageable when my son went to short, 3-hour preschool sessions 3 times a week, but the school cannot currently accept children so young . in addition to trying to be a great mom and feeling like a miserable failure, these are a few of the things on my plate on a daily basis 1 rental properties. i have recently taken over managing some of my parent's rental properties. between remodeling them myself, cleaning, doing repairs, advertising, showings, creating leasing materials and screening tenants this can consume anywhere between 3 and 12 hours a day. lately, we have had 3 turnovers back to back, so it's been averaging about 50 hours a week, although that is while also watching my son some of the time, so it takes 3 times as long to get anything done. almost all aspects are of immediate urgency since an empty house means my parents lose a lot of income. sometimes the hours are flexible, sometimes not. often, it is not possible, nor safe, to take my son with me to the properties. ocassionally, i can get grandparent help to watch my son so my husband can help me. yet, i am still overwhelmed. i keep telling myself that once we get things fixed up and vacancies filled with good tenants, then it won't be so all-encompassing, but this has already dragged on at this level for almost 5 months. 2 my son's schedule. i am lucky that my husband only works one morning a week, and then nights on weekends . he takes him to swim and music class, which take up about 3-4 hours a week. i am sad to miss these experiences with my son. i had a spare hour to take him to the grocery store yesterday and cried because i missed having outings with him so much. my husband also takes him with him to the gym for his workouts almost every day where he gets to play in the childcare center for an hour or so at a time. i also miss being able to take care of myself like that. i am still nursing my son morning, midday, and night and pumping before bed, so i build as much of my work as i can around his schedule. if i have to do things i can't take him to do, i try to schedule them from 1-4 during his nap time so my husband won't be overwhelmed. 3 mil's new build. before i took on the rentals, my mil decided to build a new house about a hour's drive away. she relies on me to coordinate most aspects of it, such as communicating and meeting with the architects, builders, permitting office, and arranging for a well to be dug, etc. some weeks this takes 20 hours, other weeks only 4 or 5, but it is always something else i have to stay aware and on top of. 4 my own house remodel. we started remodeling the house we moved into when my son was born, but a lot is still left to be done. i even have moving boxes i am still trying to unpack. this is the one piece that suffers the most right now. we do all the work ourselves and while my husband is a hard worker when he gets into it, he doesn't have the experience to be able to tackle most projects on his own, so if i am not available it doesn't happen. we have a bunch of stuff stored in the basement that i need to go through. most got moved straight into it and never opened. about 1/2 of it belongs to my mil, from whom we rent . it was my husband's childhood home so while we have gone through a lot, there is so much more to do and it has more or less been on pause for the last year. we have no trim up in most rooms, my son's bathroom isn't finished , an entire unfinished room full of furniture, a spare bedroom full of more boxes that we do need on a regular basis until our shelving and storage is finished and we have permanent places for them, and the basement, which is an unmitigated disaster. in the meantime, we live primarily on the mid-level of the house in the open-concept living room, dining room, office, and kitchen. if i have time or energy for even 3 hours a week on this stuff, it's amazing. while it isn't currently consuming time, working my life around all the unfinished stuff is challenging and it is extremely overwhelming to have it hanging out there. 5 keeping house and fed. i find that i don't have time or energy to keep up on daily household tasks. my husband does a few, but he is overwhelmed by meal planning and cooking no matter how much i try to simplify it. i have used platejoy to print up recipes and set up a plan for the week, but he hates the restriction of being limited to pre-determined meals. he feeds our son well, but will just microwave himself a polish sausage and ask if i can find something for myself. if he says he'll make dinner it may not happen until 10 30 at night, after the little guy is asleep. those days i end up fasting for at least 12 hours midday. i have severe digestive issues and have to eat carefully to keep them from incapacitating me, which gets me further behind. this makes eating late at night painful and problematic. i also, unlike my husband, can't eat processed/fast foods all the time without getting ill. if i don't find 15-20 hours a week to meal plan, shop, and cook then i don't end up having anything safe to eat when i finally have a second to do so. i do grocery pickup and send my husband to the store to save time, but it really only gains me an hour or two. my husband does dishes a few nights a week and tries to help by making frozen meals or picking up fast food. he keeps up on his own laundry and helps with mine and our son's. but the most frustrating thing is that he never puts anything back where it goes. like everything else, he promises to take care of it after our son is in bed, but it doesn't ever seem to happen despite his good intentions. 6 volunteering. i have had to cut back almost completely on volunteering at church and the preschool my son used to go to. this only takes a couple hours a week right now. sometimes, depending on the need, i can send my husband in my stead. however, like much of the above, he just doesn't have the skill set needed so i am the only one who can do it. 7 online sales. up until the rental remodels started i was selling clothes and other items online on sites such as ebay, mercari, poshmark, and local buy/sell/trade groups on fb. i've had to put this almost entirely on hold and now these items take up space in my already impossibly cluttered spare bedroom. my husband and i would both like to get back to moving these items soon, but i cannot find the time or space in the house to do this. 8 self care. i'm not a very girly lady. i only wear makeup and do my hair on special occasions and only wash my dry, fine hair a couple times a week normally, so spending no time on this isn't that different. but i am dying for some kind of time for myself. i try to take at least 30 min every night now to just sit and veg after getting my son to bed and before my evening pumping session . however, this is more just sitting there exhausted and not really personally fulfilling. sometimes, i can't sleep at night because of panic attacks over all the stuff i should be accomplishing or how i should be spending more quality time with my son. i do not know how to carve out more time for myself. any constructive advice is welcome. i just don't know how other parents are doing it all. i feel very embarrassed about how poorly i'm balancing it all and how i often feel i am at my wit's end. i don't mean to complain because i am aware how lucky we are to have the time we do with our child and to be able to be home with him as much as we are is a blessing. i just don't understand why it is so stressful for me when others seem to be busier and still have thing in hand. one of the only things keeping me going is the thought that soon the preschool will be able to take my son again and my husband and i will gain 9 hours a week child-free to work on things together and hopefully make some progress. i've toyed with the idea of a part-time nanny, but my husband is strongly against it. i think he thinks it reflects badly on us as parents to need that. he also says he is too embarrassed our house in unfinished and so messy. this is the same reason he won't currently consider hiring a babysitter now and then or a housekeeper. i am ashamed i can't find the time to keep up the house well enough so that i am the reason i can't have help. although, i also wonder if being clean and organized would change his mind because he is very uncomfortable with others in his space. i'm turning into a horrible parent and spouse because i am overwhelmed, tired, cranky, and increasingly losing hope that i'll ever have my life together enough to be a good mom or have time for friends or be able to have somewhere to invite them over. i'm always talking with and working with people, but i have never felt so pathetic and lonely.	highstrunghippie	/r/Mommit/comments/artbn3/how_do_sahms_who_also_work_do_it_all_without/	14	6	0	1.0	1550464782.0

help! our 15 month old can't fall asleep at night. please please help	i am so tired. my beloved grandma just died and i would like to crawl into a hole and cry. or at least sit down after a long day and have some quite time. my back hurts so badly from carrying her around and rocking her, my throat hurts from all the shhhh-ing and singing. we used to have a great rhythm. always the same routine. after dinner getting ready to go to bed, a little book, saying good night to everyone. then she would nurse to fall asleep. although i was really ready to stop nursing, she apparently isn't and at least, it worked. now she will nurse, then want to play and any move we try to make to get her to fall asleep will just end with endless screaming. she doesn't want to lie down which makes falling asleep extremly difficult. when we carry her around screaming, gentle rocking screaming. we've tried soft music, singing to her, white noise, a comfort object , moving her bed time and changing her sleep pattern. nothing helps. i don't think she's in pain, since she will readily interrupt her screaming if we agree to play with her. she is definitely tired. she just can't fall asleep. we haven't tried cio, since usually, , we hate to let her cry. tomorrow we have a regular check up at the pediatrician, so we'll definitely ask him to rule out any medical issues. other than being a terribly messy eater, she's developing wonderfully. but the nightly routine is killing us. so these days, she'll just scream until she's super tired and then eventually nurse to sleep or fall asleep while being carried around. but it's kind of traumatic and exhausting for everyone. it might just be a phase, but i'm really st the end of my strength right now. any ideas? please!!!	happy_go_lucky	/r/Mommit/comments/astlzy/help_our_15_month_old_cant_fall_asleep_at_night/	17	1	0	1.0	1550696102.0
when did their hands get so big?	when did their hands get so big that they didn't want to hold mine anymore? why didn't i embrace, mommy, hold my hand instead of impatiently hurrying them along? we seem to live for milestones - sleeping through the night, eating solid food, crawling, walking, potty training, talking... we couldn't wait for them to learn to read so we didn't have to always read to them at night. we couldn't wait for them to learn to drive so we didn't have to always be their chauffeur - and then in an instant, while we were wishing for all these things, they happened and they cease to need us like they used to and we thought that was what we wanted. the lack of sleep is no longer because of noisy sleepovers or because we have to pick them up from a friends but because we don't know where they are, or who they are with or when they will be home. the silence we would have given our right arm for when they were little is now deafening....	sdk1968	/r/Mommit/comments/asyb19/when_did_their_hands_get_so_big/	20	115	0	0.98	1550720802.0
how to turn a happy little guy to demon spawn in 60 seconds or less.	im not sure if this is the right place or not to ask this question/recommendation. my toddler has started throwing ridiculously dramatic tantrums already at only 18 months. im sure its perfectly normal, but i was not prepared. geez louise. he also like to tests boundaries by looking you in the eye when he does something he knows hes not allowed to do like jumping off furniture or getting all the diapers out. we use cloth, so all the folding and stuffing take what feels like forever. i do not like having to redo it. im having baby number 2 in may, so id like to some solid parenting routines and methods in place for my toddler before then that way were not stacking drastic changes on top of drastic changes. im looking for ways to discipline him that obviously hell understand, but that arent yelling or spanking because i just dont feel like those are conducive methods. although, i find myself yelling much more than i ever thought i would. its easy to be the perfect parent until you actually are one. what i would really love is recommendations on books to read on the subject matter. there are so many. id hate to get started on one, and it be super inefficient. so, what are some of your favorite parenting books for toddlers?	tina_belcher0630	/r/Mommit/comments/at8n14/how_to_turn_a_happy_little_guy_to_demon_spawn_in/	6	2	0	0.76	1550784102.0

need advice on the new momo videos. terrified toddler!	i read up today on a new scary momo hidden video on childrens cartoons on youtube. i thought my child would be unlikely to have seen this but i asked him anyway. hes 3 years old and rarely watches something without an adult next to him. he went completely quiet which was unlike him. and he said i dont want to talk about it, lets talk about something else. completely unlike him and like a rehearsed script. we told him several times these videos arent real but he continued to be literally scared stiff and refuses to talk about it. its such an extreme reaction and so we have taken extreme action. we have now banned youtube in our house and will stick to netflix. hes still very traumatised. overreaction or not i think we need to raise awareness. thankfully my child is too young to read the messages and use whastapp but can you image if he were older? boggles the mind. this stuff is dangerous and frightening. have you seen the momo videos? any suggestion on how to calm my child down and not make him scared any more? tonight hes been completely frightened and not behaving normally at all. for more info read this 	boobthrowawayboob	/r/Mommit/comments/ausu1y/need_advice_on_the_new_momo_videos_terrified/	20	11	0	0.87	1551142278.0

how to handle tantrums?	my kid is about 20 months and just starting the slowly laying on the ground and fake crying thing. it's a slow laying down and a slow crying/quacking/whining thing. she'll look over at me sometimes when she does it. my strategy so far in private has been to pick up an interesting activity, like reading a book, and start calmly doing it until she gets interested. or i'll just pick her up calmly and take her in another room and start doing something. basically i try to redirect and not react. in public i just pick her up and do something else with her to distract her. realistically, i don't have time to read books about this kind of thing. anyone have some quick and dirty advice? am i doing something wrong? anything else i could be doing? thank you! edit thank you for all of the advice! and i know the book and podcasts are useful, but truly, i don't have time and won't be doing them. whatever you got, the gist of all of those resources, just sum it up here. thank you!!

as a physician, i get many parents that are sleep deprived and asking how to get a better nights sleep. here are some tips you can try before you try medications 	all you parents out there probably know the importance of a good nights rest. without it, we are more cranky, irritable, and our mental health suffers. there is something called sleep hygiene that i recommend to all of my patients, young and old, who are having trouble sleeping. this is usually the first step your doctor will recommend before reaching for the prescription pad or any further testing. for people with insomnia or sleep deprivation the best proven treatment is not with medication but actually specialized cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. sleep hygiene is a habit that you can start to form at night time to help the brain shut off so to speak. because our brains are active and busy throughout the day, its hard for our brains just to turn off when we want them to. sleep hygiene is a set of behaviours you can implement at bedtime to help your brain shut off and get a good nights rest. parts of our society also contribute to peoples having difficulty sleeping screens from ipads, iphones, laptops, and tvs are a major contributor. these screens emit a type of light that actually interferes with our hormones in our brain which disrupts our bodies sleep-wake rhythms. as a result, its more difficult to fall asleep at night. what can i do to sleep better create a comfortable sleep environment that is quiet, clean, and dark! make sure your room does not have light coming in during the time you are asleep. dont use your bed for anything but sleeping . relax for 90 minutes before bed no stressful conversations, intense tv shows, or working really hard. never go to bed hungry if you need to, have a snack. go to bed at the same time every day, and wake up at the same time every day . even if you get a crummy nights sleep the night before, still try to get out of the bed at the same time the next morning. over time, with this your sleep will become more regular. get active throughout the day. try and get at least 30 minutes of heart pumping exercise. preferably at the beginning of your day, but for sure no later than 2-3 hours before you go to bed as this will prevent you from winding down. avoid alcohol alcohol disrupts your restful stages of sleep, so although you might fall asleep easier and even sleep more, you will not spend your time sleeping in the restful stages which will make you much more tired the next day . dont smoke, but if you do try not to smoke several hours before bed. nicotine stimulates the brain and can make it more difficult to sleep. get as much natural sunlight throughout the day! this will help regulate your sleep-wake cycle. if you live in a part of the world that gets light at all hours you will want to black out your house from light during the night and in the 2-3 hours before you wind down for bed. go to your doctor and have them review your medications some medications can prevent people from falling asleep . likewise, some medications can make people sleep throughout the day . optimizing medications that are interfering with your sleep may will help. if you have difficulty with sleep, avoid napping throughout the day . napping throughout the day can throw off your sleep cycle making it more difficult to fall asleep, and stay asleep, at night. sleep hygiene is a process and you do need to be patient! hang in there, be persistent and consistent with the changes you made!

any tips on preparing for sibling jealousy?	we're expecting baby 2 in a few weeks and my son will be about 2 years and 8 months. we've done a ton of prep for baby stuff with him, like reading books, showing him photos of him as a baby, explaining what will happen , what the baby will be like, and he has a lot of exposure to his peers' new babies as well. he really likes babies at the moment but he gets really upset and jealous if i hold a friend's baby or am too affectionate towards a baby or even another kid, so i am gearing for the fact that he might have this response when the baby is here. for the most part he doesn't tend to be physically aggressive but i am thinking he might act out somewhat when baby arrives. any tips on how to pre-emptively deal with this?	itsmeeloise87	/r/Mommit/comments/b2wvwj/any_tips_on_preparing_for_sibling_jealousy/	31	45	0	0.95	1552999005.0
advice on 2month old sleeping issues	my son is going to be 2 months in a week. we started off by having him sleep in his crib. that was good until he was a few weeks old. when he started being aware of things around him, he didn't wanna be put down so much and wakes up every 1-2 hrs to feed, so we started having nights where he sleeps with me in the recliner while i hold him. well, these past... say 2 weeks, he would have some fussy nights. . i would nurse him while on the recliner. then when he is done and starts feeling sleepy, he would fuss. i then have to stand up and cradle him to sleep. i put him to his crib, 10 minutes he is awake again. then repeat from cradling part. so.. the other night i just cannot do it, i was very tired. already tripping standing up, so i figured we sleep together on our bed. i just needed to lie down or i will faint. the night after that, same thing happened , so we sleep the bed together again. tonight, i let daddy try to get him to sleep. it worked before. but he was soooo fussy. maybe the fussiest he's ever been so far. he didn't stop crying. so i had to put him to bed and sleep next to him again. i am scared that this is gonna be his routine. we're didn't plan to co- sleep, but nothing seemed to work. my husband and i need our rest as wet both work. now i am worried. i just want him to be okay sleeping in his crib and be okay to be put down. any advice please.	eebernal	/r/Mommit/comments/b2znli/advice_on_2month_old_sleeping_issues/	5	1	0	0.67	1553013654.0

little discipline advice?	so right now im really struggling with discipline in two major areas 1 my kids try to ask me for the same thing over and over even after ive said no. how do i deal with this? they know i dont ever give in to them after ive already said no. ive tried giving them multiple choices but my youngest always insists she wants a different option entirely 2 the fights. oh, the fights. three year old boy and two year old girl. 15 months apart. i feel like im constantly intervening in disputes of all kinds. i thought once i put my son in preschool 3 days a week it would help because hed get his own time away in preschool, and my daughter could have one on one time with me for 4 hours straight 3 days a week. my son loves preschool since hes very social and my daughter and i go to dance class or indoor play centers which she loves. i thought giving them each this time would improve things but it has not. they still acts like little wildlings the moment you get them in a room together . i think they kind of like fighting, like it gives them an adrenaline rush or something....but of course it always ends badly. anyway ive probably rambled too much. any advice would be much appreciated.	jmf337	/r/Mommit/comments/b474r9/little_discipline_advice/	3	0	0	0.5	1553272095.0

what age did you have the talk with your kid ?	i hope this is ok to post here! just looking for advice from fellow mommy's. i was reading a flyer that i saw on defendinnocence.org called little talks to have with your 5-8 year old and the first one says teach them about reproduction . my daughter is 8, and she knows her anatomy and also the male anatomy, she asked me a couple of years ago and i didn't want her to feel like it's weird to wonder about those types of things, so i told her very factually. to be honest though i never thought about having that type of talk with her, not for a few years. any thoughts? when did you talk to your kids about this? i've been debating, only because a few of her friends at school have already talked to her about sex and she's asked about it but i've just said she's too young to be worrying about that right now . at the same time, if i ignore it and let her friends fill her head with their version of sex, i feel like that might be worse than just talking to her about it. i've also never wanted to stigmatize it, i don't want her to feel like it's an unnatural thing and i definitely don't want her to feel like she can't talk to me about it or come to me with any questions she may have.

how do i let my sister down gently?	tl dr at the bottom. long post, sorry. mobile formatting.... i've been watching my nephew for 7 months now. i have a 2 year old and we're expecting our second baby later this year. when i started watching my nephew i was under the impression it would be for 3-4 months. she got a different job and now i only watch him a few days a week. no big deal except he cries so much when she's gone. he has no set nap schedule, he only takes a few ounces at a time and will only eat foods if he's in a good mood. his happy time is usually only a couple hours throughout the day in about 20 minute chunks. he sleeps better when he's being held and even then it's only a half hour at a time. he's used to having mom, nursing, sleeping in her arms, having attention and interaction constantly, and being held frequently. i can't blame her for any of that because that's what she wants to do with her baby. however, this is taking such a toll on me. i have depression and anxiety then factoring in my pregnancy hormones- i basically cry when he's here lately. he can be a happy boy, i know that. but that's when he's with mom or dad, mainly mom. i told her i could keep watching him until i was closer to my due date but after having a break last week and seeing the change in my mood and how it positively effected my son to not be shushed or told sorry, i'll do that with you later all the time, i've decided i just can't keep going. i want to enjoy my nephew, not stress about his being here. how do i let her know this is how i'm feeling and that i want to quit? they would be okay financially if she quit as they've been planning for it for a while. but i know this would be upsetting for her husband to lose her extra income. i just don't know what to do anymore. tl dr - i don't want to watch my nephew anymore and need advice on how to tell my sister i want to quit .	nerdymama601	/r/Mommit/comments/b8ng2n/how_do_i_let_my_sister_down_gently/	32	133	0	0.99	1554231962.0

new working mom becoming depressed please help.	i don't know if this is the right place to post. i'm just at my wit's end, but i feel like what i'm going through isn't even that bad compared to some other parents, or more experienced parents. i've always been really resourceful and resilient, type a, super hard working, can-do, etc. right now i feel like i am being crushed by motherhood, and i'm noticing anxiety/depression like symptoms creeping in. i have a history of anxiety and do not want to be derailed by this. please read my sob story and tell me what i need to change. i feel like i'm doing a terrible job of identifying this myself. we have a 5 month old who is very intense . she needs to be constantly entertained, held, etc. she has a ravenous appetite and i've been exclusively breastfeeding. i pump 3x a work and sometimes one more time during my commute. it is never enough and my stash is declining. she's been at home with a babysitter for 3 months but will start daycare in a month or so. i'm hoping to continue bfing for the immunity benefits. i want to emphasize that i am absolutely in love with her, bonded very well, and never do i actively blame her for any of these things. i find myself 100% blaming myself and feeling like just the worst mother on the planet. her skin is a mess - she started getting eczema when she turned 4 months old, and there is a weeping patch behind her ear that refuses to heal - if it starts healing she will just rub it raw against the sheets or her sleep sack. we've gone back to swaddling her because her hands are constantly rubbing her face and waking herself up, even with mittens. her sleep has been destroyed by this. she was never a great sleeper, but was at least able to do some 3-4 hour stretches at night. now she wakes up every 2 hours due to itching, and a couple weeks ago hit some sort of regression in which she refuses to be put down after nursing at night. so we have reluctantly brought her into bed with us to even restore the 2 hour stretches of sleep. we are zombies. her naps are all over the place and if we want her to nap longer than 30 minutes we have to hold her sitting in the chair. her babysitter does this a couple times a day. we have been trying various skin regimens with her but nothing really works great. i'm inordinately stressed every night knowing all the progress on her skin patch will be undone by her rubbing at night. i realize i'm maybe irrationally focused on this? i have a demanding job that has been very understanding and flexible with me leaving early and working at home. however, i had to stop working from home because my daughter will go insane if she sees me or realizes i am there - she only wants me. if she knows i'm home she will cry violently until i get there. when i leave in the morning she is with my husband until the sitter arrives - she almost always is screaming when i'm going out the door. i just get in my car in tears and start pumping, which is more brutal than i thought possible. my husband also works full time and is in school part time, 4 nights a week. i get no breaks, i pump in the car, i do work while pumping at work, i squeeze everything i can into all the time i have available. we have no family nearby that can help. in fact, communicating with family about all of this just makes everything harder. they give plenty of advice and admonishment with no actual assistance. i just don't know how long i can keep going. i'm starting to have some really dark thoughts that i can't even write here. i was in therapy during my pregnancy but won't be able to go back to my regular therapist due to her schedule. i tried to find a new therapist i can go to during the day, but no one near me has openings. a coworker with a baby the same age was bragging about how their baby is hitting every milestone early and sleeps 12 hours a night. i almost burst into tears and had to run to the bathroom. there are some things which we haven't put onto the table just yet i don't want to stop breastfeeding. i don't want to sleep train with crying it out . and anyway i can't fathom doing any kind of training or regimen since i am alone with the baby most evenings and can barely eat or go to the bathroom myself. my husband is considering taking a year off school, but i still need to make it the next couple of months alone. our relationship has been damaged by all this but i honestly don't even have time to think about that right now. neither does he. i'm sorry this is so long. my spirit and self esteem has been absolutely crushed by this. we adore our girl and just want even one of the things to get better so we can keep going. i also feel totally ridiculous because we are privileged with two incomes, two jobs, health insurance, a place to live, etc etc. i grew up with immigrant parents who certainly did not have all of those things. so there is a sense of not deserving to complain either. thank you for reading if you've made it this far...	piyopiyo102	/r/Mommit/comments/b9ej9n/new_working_mom_becoming_depressed_highneeds_baby/	7	5	0	1.0	1554393487.0
lead poisoning in a two year old? help/advice?	i dont know if this is the right place to put this but i dont know where else i would put it. this is probably going to be long. ill try to tldr but i dont know how good itll be. my son, t, has been displaying some concerning signs over the past month. really its been longer but it got bad enough i started worrying he had some sort of behavioral issue. he randomly goes into fits of throwing himself on the ground and screaming and slamming his head into the ground to the point of bruising and almost busting open his forehead. thats when i decided id had enough, he was actually physically hurting himself, and i took him into the doctor. when hes not throwing a fit hes a perfectly happy loving baby boy who plays with everything he can get his hands on, its almost like a light switch being turned. the first appointment t started throwing one of the tantrums and the doctor tried everything. giving him treats i brought for him, holding him, talking to him, just letting him scream. eventually he brought in another doctor. who tried all the same things. she didnt know what could be wrong so she called in behavioral health doctors after checking his ears for ear infections. he had a small one but she said it shouldnt be causing this sort of pain but shed give me the meds to get rid of it anyway to eliminate it completely and then to come back. the behavioral health doctors came in and looked at him and tried calming him down with no results and gave me some pieces of paper with different techniques i could start doing at home. i was told to finish the meds out and try the techniques and then come back with the results. my husband, m, and i are a very good team. we work together, we communicate, we both love our son and each other very much. so we had no trouble telling each other what we tried when my son had a fit. t loved his medicine and took it happily when we offered it and his ear infection cleared right up no problem. but the fits did not and none of the techniques worked. im talking hours long fits that nothing helps. t never tried to hit me during his fits, he occasionally slaps at m but not hard. we took him to the next appointment about two weeks later and shared our results and got his ear looked at. the doctor we saw was different from the other doctors wed seen but shed read all the notes and had a good idea of what we said happens and then got to see t go into one of his fits. she immediately said she thought it was a pain response. which raised the question of what could be causing him this much pain? i brought up that my younger brother had a brain tumor they found when he was around ts age and she said she was going to get a catscan done and then hopefully an mri but shed have to fight her higher ups for that. she also ordered blood tests to rule out different things. we got the blood tests done and then went home after he behavioral therapist came in and talked to me again over what techniques i can use to try and calm him down before he starts. that was last week. havent gotten the catscan done yet. but i got a call from the doctor we saw who ordered the blood tests. she said that theyd found increased levels of lead in his system and asked if he was exposed to it a lot. that this could be causing his problems. my husband and i instantly launched into investigation mode to try and find what could possibly have given him lead poisoning. the house we live in is old, but ms mother and father moved into it when m and his sister were young and they tested it for lead paint and it all came back negative. a few years later they tested again because they had to get the windows replaced and it also came back negative. so that was out. the doctor mentioned that the pipes may be lead or have lead or maybe even the water. i went straight to lowes and bought a water testing kit and did it as soon as i got home and it came back as safe too. t doesnt have any old toys with paint or metal that could have done it. no other places that could possibly have lead that he goes to enough to even get that much in him. no hobbies we do that would have lead involved or makeup or anything. were stumped. we have zero idea what could have done this. its frustrating and scary to know that if i hadnt taken my son into the doctor when i did things could have been so much worse. i dont really know what im doing. venting maybe. we have doubts that the test is right because of not having any ideas where it could be coming from, that maybe its a false positive or something. me, m, and t all have appointments tomorrow to get our blood tested . just in case we have it too and just dont know it. but we dont have any symptoms of it and neither does my mil who lives with us. if any of you have any ideas of what it could be, let me know. because for the life of me i cant figure it out and i feel like a terrible mom for not knowing what could be causing this sort of thing and that he might be in constant pain because of it. tldr went in for behavioral problems. came out with a possible lead poisoning. no idea where it could be coming from and no idea what to do from here.	dreamweirddreams	/r/Mommit/comments/b9ih7h/lead_poisoning_in_a_two_year_old_helpadvice/	21	8	0	0.91	1554412426.0

potty training advice	we've been potty training for about 2 weeks, and my son will still pee on the floor 10 minutes after we've asked him if he needs to go. sometimes he seems to do ok, like at daycare, but usually he comes home with at least one pair of wet pants and underwear. he's 3.5 and is supposed to be starting a new daycare in 3 weeks where he must be potty trained, but i'm not sure he's getting it. any advice?	kendallcorner	/r/Mommit/comments/baamyf/potty_training_advice/	7	5	0	0.86	1554595594.0
my son is speech delayed and he's running around playing with 3 kids who are bigger than him.	my son will be 4yo in june. when he was evaluated for speech at 2.5yo, the therapist said she couldn't understand a single word, and she's paid to understand. . he's been in speech therapy ever since and we enrolled him in preschool and sign him up for the occasional parents night out drop off. i'm sitting here at the park. watching them run around the baseball diamond, in and out of dugouts and through the baseball fields. dare i say he's the ringleader? as i'm writing this, another kid joined the pack. they look like they're over there planning an adventure. anyway. it's sort of emotional for me. my child, with a pretty bad speech delay, who's come so far, but still has so far to go, is just one of the kids on the playground. doing normal kid things. not caring for a second that some kids have to ask him to repeat himself. just, communicating like a little person.	3InaRow	/r/Mommit/comments/bbdlwb/my_son_is_speech_delayed_and_hes_running_around/	13	25	0	0.97	1554845139.0
 does anyone have any experience with waardenburg syndrome?	tl;dr my daughter may have waardenburg syndrome, what next? my daughter was born with white patches of hair that i pointed out to her pediatrician at her first appointment. the pediatrician shrugged and said there is a condition that causes deafness that can be associated with white patches of hair, but since she passed her newborn hearing screening, she wasn't concerned. the pediatrician did go ahead and make a note of it since there is some hearing loss in the family. over the last few months i've noticed my daughter startling/reacting less to loud noises . at her four month check up her pediatrician referred us to an audiologist, so we went and this time her right ear passed but her left ear didn't. the audiologist said that it was a borderline failure, so she wants to test again in 2 months . can the hearing loss/deafness associated with waardenburg syndrome be progressive? everything i've found online just says that it causes deafness in one or both ears, but none of it says if people with the syndrome are born deaf or become deaf. i want to know if she could go deaf over time so i can start learning/teaching her asl as soon as possible. i want to be able to give her as much of a headstart as i can.	mesmol	/r/Mommit/comments/bbhjhm/advice_does_anyone_have_any_experience_with/	3	2	0	0.76	1554868487.0

please help me - 1 year old has never slept through the rnight	my daughter is absolutely wonderful. she's a bouncy, happy baby with a bright, intelligent personality. but she doesn't sleep longer than 2 hours at a time. it's been really draining, i've pretty much stopped going out at night or making plans or anything because she cannot go to sleep without me. sometimes it takes me more than hour to get her to fall asleep. and i know it's my fault, i nurse her to sleep. she has the strongest sleep association i've ever seen. there was a point when she was around 3 months old, when she would put herself to sleep and only woke up once at night. but then i had a serious eye condition and was hospitalised for 3 nights and that just unraveled everything. we went on vacation for 3 weeks after that, and it just completely destroyed her sleep patterns. since august, she has never fallen asleep without nursing, and has not slept for longer than 2 hours. usually, it's less than that. we tried ferber's cry it out method and it didn't work. she has an extremely determined personality, and just would not stop crying. she cried to the point of total hysteria and stopped breathing so my husband and i decided that that method isn't for us. does anyone know any other way we can make this work? i just want her to fall asleep on her own and sleep through the night. it's been so hard for me and i've broken down so many times i've lost count. any advice would be really appreciated.	gypsysunandrainbows	/r/Mommit/comments/bdi4e6/please_help_me_1_year_old_has_never_slept_through/	38	38	0	0.95	1555346028.0

postpartum is a mother. does anyone have some advice for a new mama??	sorry this is kinda long but i need to vent..... im a mom of an almost 8 month old. i really thought the depression would ease off by now. i also work 40+ hours a week from home. before anyone tells me working from home is easy.... they are sadly mistaken. dont get me wrong, i absolutely love staying at home with my baby but its also stressful. trying to answer a call from your boss while your son is screaming is no fun. his dad also works 40+ hours a week as an electrician. sometimes i feel like he doesnt help as much as he could. i feel like he uses me staying home to work as an excuse to not help as much. ive tried talking to him but it usually just turns into a fight. i probably sound like a naggy nelly, but the last few weeks have been hard. i feel like i go from one extreme emotion to another. one minute i feel like i can do anything and the next minute i want to rip someones head off. im sure sleep deprivation is part of it but i was just wondering if any other moms are struggling too. and if you are struggling whats some advice you have for a new mom? thanks for listening... err i mean reading 	coloradosayshigh	/r/Mommit/comments/benhj3/postpartum_is_a_mother_does_anyone_have_some/	14	5	0	1.0	1555604390.0
unplanned pregnancy - not sure why i'm keeping it secret.	hi everyone, i have thought long and hard about posting this but ultimately i decided that someone might have wisdom i could glean. &; i am 14 weeks pregnant. my husband and i have a few kids already and we love and cherish them above all else. after our last child, less than two years ago, we decided that we were done. our friends and our family knew we were done as well and they supported this choice as we have very busy lives including our children, careers and my graduate studies. we have a wonderfully involved and supportive family but i believe they were glad that our plan was not to have any more. &; i got a hormonal iud which seemed to work well enough for over a year. until it didn't. long story short my iud shifted and here we are. i am now in my second trimester and absolutely nobody outside of our household has a clue . i am very thin and toned and i have easy pregnancies so there is no reason for anyone to suspect my condition. i know that i have to tell my boss soon but i have paralyzing anxiety about the whole situation. i know our families have a right to know but i just can't bring myself to that point. &; my husband is ready to tell the world. i absolutely love this little boy already and i have no idea why i feel so ashamed. we are responsible and financially independent parents and we are fully able to care for him regardless of previous intentions in regards to family planning. i feel guilty because i somehow believe i let others down and because my body failed to meet my expectations. i also feel guilty because we have been so blessed when others struggle with fertility. &; mostly i feel like i have somehow failed as a mother because i am not ready to broadcast this news to the world even though he will be loved beyond measure. &; has anyone dealt with anything like this before?	la_sirena89	/r/Mommit/comments/bgq1go/unplanned_pregnancy_not_sure_why_im_keeping_it/	15	13	0	0.93	1556078223.0
how to get my sexual mojo back?	it used to be that i was 90% of the time the initiator of sex. i felt very sexual, and in fact sometimes would be bothered by his lower sex drive. after my first baby, it took a while to get back into the swing of things, but i still had the desire. we weren't very romantic during the 2nd pregnancy, as my comfort level and sex drive dropped rapidly although we did do a lot of intimate talks and cuddles. now three months after the birth we are at complete 6 month dry spell. i'm incredibly tired. although i still find my husband incredibly sexy, i just do not want to have sex. like, zero. i have self-pleasured but it just seems so much work and effort to have actual sex. i can tell my husband is getting frustrated but i just can't seem to get it together enough to be sexual with him. how did you ladies get your mojo back?

first time mom, need advice for weaning 8 month old!	on mobile, so excuse the formatting. i am a first time mother of a wonderful baby girl, which we have both been lucky enough to exclusively breastfeed! she is currently 8 months old, will be 9 months on the 23rd, and has barely had a real interest in eating solids until last week. she has never taken a bottle or cared for her pacifier, and just chews on the sippy cups i offer. i have been not working since i was 36 weeks pregnant and need to get back to work. what are the best ways to get an ebf infant who has only ate from the breasts to wean more smoothly?	wendig-o	/r/Mommit/comments/bk0rzx/first_time_mom_need_advice_for_weaning_8_month_old/	5	1	0	1.0	1556834600.0
they're planning my gender reveal for me. intrusive or just generous? need advice!!	hello all, it's my first pregnancy and everything is new to me and my husband. most of it has been pretty cool so far, but there's this one thing that's bugging me and i wanted a consensus just to see if i'm being too sensitive. my husband manages a restaurant and spends most of his time with his staff just by the nature of the job, so they're all very close. they all seem to like me a lot, but they only really see me on the occasional hangout at my house, or when i drop by the restaurant. we're friends, but not exactly what i would call close. of course, everyone's excited that we're having a baby, but recently it's stepped up to a notch i'm not very comfortable with. one of his employees got the idea for all the girls to pool their money together and schedule me for a 3d ultrasound. okay, sure, incredibly generous if not a little unusual . but then i was told that not only did they want to pay for it, but jan wanted everyone to be there with me at the appointment--meaning i'd have at least 8 girls that i only kind of know hanging around a waiting room with me. all this as a precursor to a gender reveal party , meaning that i would get this high res picture but not get to know the sex of my own baby for at least a week while they put this party together. now, we've effectively shut down the entourage in the waiting room thing, because jan was the only one who thought that was a good idea. but this whole thing feels a little intrusive to me. no one asked me if i wanted any of this--nobody even contacted me to tell me it was even happening. i heard all of this secondhand from my husband, who seems just as baffled and unsure about it as i am. it feels disrespectful to turn them down since god knows how much money they put towards this, but it also feels like what i want isn't even being considered next to what all these other people want. it would be different if my mom or my sister-in-law or something, but it feels weird that this group of girls i barely know are putting this elaborate thing together for me without even asking me what my plans are. and something like a gender reveal party seems like something i should at least have a say in. again, it's my first time so i don't know how these things normally go. plus, i'm a lifelong only child who's usually pretty independent, and these are all people from big southern families who are all about that it takes a village life, so it's all very new to me for so many people to suddenly be so interested in me . am i being too sensitive and resistant, or am i right to be a little put off by all of this? and how can i put my foot down without seeming ungrateful? any input would be appreciated. thanks!	witchhazelwine	/r/Mommit/comments/bkgpwz/theyre_planning_my_gender_reveal_for_me_intrusive/	8	5	0	1.0	1556938183.0
how to sterilize baby bottles?	i hope this is not a dumb question. i'm a ftm and have several brand of bottles 1. philip advent natural 2. nuk simply natural 3. timmee toppee 4. boon nursh silicone all instructions just say disassemble and sterilize by boiling for 5 minutes or sterilizer. so.. do i put everything including the cap, nipple, the lid that attaches the nipple with the bottle, bottle into boiling water? just confused. also do you guys sterilize each use? my baby was born at 37 weeks and 3 days, doctor didn't mention anything about having to sterilize each time so we just use hot water and soap to clean each time. i read somewhere that if baby is premature then best to feed ready to feed instead of powdered first. we plan to sterilize once a month.	optimumcliff	/r/Mommit/comments/blo90e/how_to_sterilize_baby_bottles/	14	1	0	1.0	1557218548.0
mobility prep, need your advice!	hey all! hope your week is going well so far. i am due in august and we're moving to a new place in june. i am the type that loves to have 'stations' around the house for convenience but mostly to battle my household's epic laziness. in preparing for our first go at babyhood, i'm thinking i want to prepare those 'stations' in key places- next to couch/glider, nightstands, in the dining room, etc- where i'll be putting non-fridge snacks, handy wipes for spills/spit up, extra burp rags, etc. i'd like to have small trash cans in those places and obviously lidless will be easiest on the adults. but she'll crawl quickly, and i'm coming up blank on a solution that will be easy for me/dh/nanny to use but that won't be a hazard for lo. put them up on the endtable/nightstand? somehow find trash bins that pin to the wall but don't look hideous? get over it and walk to the kitchen garbage to dispose of trash? i'm really at a loss. so, parents with crawlers, walkers, runners- what do you do about small room trash? with this move to a new place, should i be focusing on clear surfaces safe for little hands, will lidded trash bins work for curious toddlers? i just don't want to waste money on solutions i'll have to replace in six months.	lunatic_minge	/r/Mommit/comments/blqz85/mobility_prep_need_your_advice/	3	3	0	0.81	1557237267.0

please help solve my daycare dropoff/pickup problem!	i have a 16-month old who goes to a daycare 3 days/week. she is very mobile and walks really well, but does not yet understand that she must either hold my hand or be carried when walking through parking lots. in the mornings, she lets me carry her in without an issue, but in the afternoons, she melts down every.single.day. and just lays on the sidewalk until i pick her up kicking and screaming and carry her to the car. now, this of course is not desirable and often embarrassing, but we make it work. the problem is that i also now have a 1-week old. when she is 8-weeks old, my sister-in-law will begin taking care of her 2 days/week. i had originally planned to drop off my infant first and then take my toddler to daycare and pick up the toddler before picking up the baby. but, now that i think of it more, the toddler will be in the car at least 45-minutes each way with these logistics, when she often starts getting restless after 15-20 minutes at a time. so, i'm wondering if anyone has any ideas on how i can get the toddler into/out of daycare safely while also toting a newborn in an infant car seat? or will the toddler just have to deal with long car rides 2 days/week? thanks for any input anyone may have!!	alliroad	/r/Mommit/comments/bo8ljw/please_help_solve_my_daycare_dropoffpickup_problem/	10	6	0	0.75	1557778563.0

struggling with support beyond my spouse	so, my mom died before i had kids. my husband is amazing. my dad, well, hes this insensitive bachelor now who just doesnt get that i could use some support from time to time. my aunts on my moms side want me to go on a short, 4 day trip to help my aunt move and to give me a getaway, since my husband works on long trips away from home and it has been a long couple of months with him away. i would love a trip! my dad is just so hard to deal with. its like he is groaning as i ask him to help. not to mention playing games with me as i had a hard time the last time he brought his gf of 2 months to my house around my kids. so, my question is, do i just forget it all and not go, especially if my dad isnt into it or as he accepts, do i just hope for the best and that it will be good bonding time? it would just be during the day as my hubby works 9-5. im asking him for 2-3 days. im actually ok if he brings his gf. however i think i hurt him the last time she came because she stopped in while i was away and he was supposed to watch my kids for 2 hours even when i said i wasnt ready for her to visit without me or my husband around. im feeling low.... i just miss my mom so much. i feel like my kids are missing out. my hubbys parents are good, but my father in law is at home with late stage als, and so my mil has so much on her plate right now. i am mad at my dad and the situation is just so complicated. feels like my dad is keeping score and getting back at me by taking back his agreement to help with the kids.

19 month old pulling hair out... advice/experience welcome	also posting this to r/toddlers and r/parenting... my daughter is 19 months old and has been pulling her hair for comfort on one side of her head, the same side she sucks her thumb. it's been going on for a solid 6 months now and she has a sizable bald spot on her head from it. first, we thought it was a phase and did nothing to see if she would grow out of it. when it was becoming more noticeable we bought a cardigan that covers her hands to put on her sleep sack which helped some but she still does it in the car. tried a second cardigan for the car but she's starting to protest wearing it and it hasn't completely stopped the behavior. i've tried distraction, hats, ignoring it, etc. and she still pulls out chunks of hair at a time. i am at the point where i am thinking of cutting her hair super short so she can't pull it anymore and see if the time it takes to grow in stops the behavior. if anyone has done this, how long did it take to grow back and did it help stop hair pulling? she has gorgeous curls on the other side of her head and it's going to be really hard to do, but i don't want this to be a lasting behavior. picture for reference 	artsewlove	/r/Mommit/comments/broon2/19_month_old_pulling_hair_out_adviceexperience/	18	3	0	0.67	1558531042.0

 no, i don't want bath! no, no, no! no, i don't want out bath! 	our toddler goes back and forth between loving and hating bath time. hating it is almost certainly because she knows bedtime is coming soon. we would try to entice her with playing with her bath toys as that's the only time she gets to or brushing her teeth because she loves the taste of the toothpaste and sucking water out of the toothbrush. brushing her teeth usually goes really well! yeah, for oral hygiene! only when it comes time to get in the bath, more often than not, she cries, screams, pitches an unholy fit. she tries to hide from the sponge and uses her dad as a shield even if he's the one bathing her. once the actual bathing part is over, she's totally fine and plays happily. and then doesn't want to get out when it's time. all that fighting and suddenly she's happy in the tub. i love her to pieces, but geez....	babutterfly	/r/Mommit/comments/bs5p0x/no_i_dont_want_bath_no_no_no_no_i_dont_want_out/	10	9	0	1.0	1558632150.0

is it just my toddler who sleeps like she's still 8 weeks old?	my dd has always slept like crap. i mean, up for 18 hours straight like crap. perfectly content, just not tired. as she got older it did get better. but she still only sleeps for 2 hour stretches at night. once a week she'll sleep for an 8 hour stretch, wake up and go right back to sleep for a few more hours. other nights 4 hour stretches. it doesn't matter what i do. no naps, one nap in the morning, one nap in the afternoon, two naps. early bedtime, later bedtime. we are always outside playing, going places and doing things. more snacks, more fluid. we have a fan, we have a blue night light. no night light. maybe this is the norm? she has 16 out of 20 teeth and i don't see any popping through. sleep sack, no sleep sack. it doesn't matter. she does still nurse at night and i have a feeling it plays a roll in her waking up. maybe it's a comfort thing at this point? she can't possibly be that thirsty? she drinks milk and water throughout the day. she has 6-10 wet daipers a day. she eats like she's a whole army. i mention her food and water intake because at first i thought maybe she's still hungry? who wants to go to bed hungry? maybe she's still thirsty? nope. and nope. we tried a calm bath before bed, reading books. shutting off electrics and reading books. there is no formula for a good night sleep. maybe i just answered my own question. she's a toddler, there is no answer, haha. my husband thinks she should be sleeping through the night by now, i wish she would. i don't necessarily have a problem with it, i'm used to it at this point. but sleep is important, for her . i've heard stories about babies sleeping through the night at a few months old and i've heard other people tell me their kid didn't sleep through the night until they were 3 or 4. sleeping through the night to me is 12 hours. without waking up 5 times. are my expectations ridiculous? any tips or tricks are welcomed . edit thanks everyone for all the advice! when i can get to you all, i will right now she skipped her morning nap, not by design. we'll see so tonight goes	texasbrownies	/r/Mommit/comments/btm1uj/is_it_just_my_toddler_who_sleeps_like_shes_still/	45	45	0	0.96	1558964087.0
advice for picky eaters?	hi all! my son will be 2 and a half in early june. when he was a baby and we did blw, he loved trying new foods, but now he sometimes doesnt even eat things that he usually loves. i can get him to eat almost anything if i chop it super small and mix it with rice, but other than that he just loves pb&j, grilled cheese, plain pasta, goldfish and all fruits. im so thankful he loves fruit. i know this is normal for the age, and as long as theyre eating something that its okay, but should i keep at least offering different foods? i try to make him plates with something he loves, something he likes, and something he might try. some days hell eat new things, but usually not. i feel like a bad mom sometimes because i usually have to make him something separate from our dinner because he wont try it. i guess what im really curious about is, if youve got older children and have been through this, how long does this phase usually last? do i keep trying/offering him what were eating even if i know he wont eat it? im at a loss.	onegrumpymama	/r/Mommit/comments/btndh9/advice_for_picky_eaters/	6	7	0	1.0	1558971309.0

depression in young kids? could use some advice please	im sure this is not the right subreddit for this but ive met some really nice people here and feel most comfortable with this community. ive posted about my situation before, but to sum it up, i was in a relationship that was emotionally abusive for a long time and was becoming physically abusive too. he caused me to lose a baby and one argument he broke two of my fingers and my 9 year old girl broke it up. those two things happened and i left. i knew i had to get out and the kids were going to be in danger. he wanted me to stop working to stay home and raise his son so when we left, we left everything. once i stopped working he took me off the bank account and stopped paying all my bills. allowed my car to be repossessed. he gave me an allowance every week and i had to make sure i kept the receipts or he wouldnt give me more next week for the things the kids needed. he held onto my id and if i needed it i had to ask for it. had to rely on him for rides. everything. im saying this here now to explain that now that we have left, we are struggling. it is just going to take some time for us to get back on our feet. we will get there though! my point of this post is my 9 year old had a conversation with me the other night that broke my heart. she has been having bad anxiety and she said shes depressed. until recently, my ex did not do anything wrong to me in front of the kids so shes confused. he wasnt her biological father but he was amazing to her and she called him dad. so shes grieving the loss of him and our family and we are struggling so bad now its pathetic the situation that we are in. so shes stressed about that. shes missed some school because i couldnt afford to get her there. we are 20 minutes away now after leaving. she is wearing the same clothes regularly when she is there. we are just in transition and this is obviously scary and confusing for her and i feel like such a bad mom for my kids even going through this. especially my oldest because she soaks everything in at this age. shes so extremely smart. ive been dealing with depression too and i try to hide it and put on a brave face for my kids but right now we are all sharing a bed so she says at night when i think shes sleeping she can hear me cry. she told me she just wants to go to sleep and never wake up. she wants to die and she feels like her dad is acting like this because she isnt good enough. shes very anxious and depressed and the thoughts she has of herself are heartbreaking and thoughts no child should have. i wanted to post to see if any moms have a young child go through this? please dont judge me i know i am responsible for this and i feel terrible already. i am doing everything i can to be more stable for these kids and i know living in chaos is not something any child deserves. i know i need to get her a counselor and have already contacted her school for age appropriate recommendations. any moms go through this? or just have any advice? my heart is broken that my child feels this way and i want to do everything i possibly can to make her feel better.	mommy0ftwo0918	/r/Mommit/comments/bueqny/depression_in_young_kids_could_use_some_advice/	12	10	0	0.75	1559136815.0

advice for being productive?	i have a 4-month old , and i am a stay at home mom. i've been having a tough time being productive during the day, though. my baby isn't very consistent with naps right now, sometimes they last 20 minutes and sometimes they last 2 hours, but i never know which it's going to be. we have also just gotten a new house, so in addition to normal chores, everything needs to be unpacked and organized. . i see a lot of advice online like, have your baby help! , but hes really too little to help me with anything right now. i do have a carrier , but i think it would get in the way of a lot of chores. so how do you guys keep things clean, while also keeping your baby entertained?

i need help sleeping!	hey there! first time here, first time mom as well. my daughter is 5 months old and she sleeps great sometimes. a little back story she slept 4 hours at a time since birth. and i think i may have spoiled her with letting her sleep on my husband and i's bed, because now shes super picky about where she sleeps. she's a belly sleeper, that's what she prefers, but her on her back and shes wide awake and flips to her tummy. when she was sleeping in her bassinet next to my bed she was fine for 2 months, but then she began to not sleep when i set her down in it. so i switched her to her crib, which is a cosleeping crib, and she slept like an angel again. until now. she will not stay asleep once i put her in her crib. she nurses herself to sleep and when i put her down she wakes right up and wiggles around, whines etc. i dont understand why. is she uncomfortable in her crib now? she sometimes falls asleep on her playmate on the floor which has absolutely no padding and seems very uncomfortable. but she also loves to take naps and fall asleep on the couch which is very comfortable. literally anywhere but her crib. i dont know what to do. it's been a week of barely sleeping and i can't take much more of her waking up every 20 minutes. shes also teething but that doesnt stop her from sleeping anywhere else just fine for hours. any advice?

is my kid racist? how do i teach him not to be.	i was reading a book to my 5 year old and it had a picture of a monkey in the book. my son says to me dylan has a face just like that monkey. dylan is the one black kid in his class. he doesnt particularly get along very well with dylan and has made comments about him before. i dont want dylan to come to my birthday because he pees his pants stuff like that. never about his looks or race though. i was caught off guard and i just told him that we all look like monkeys because we evolved from monkeys and went that route. but its been nagging me ever since that i need to do better. i think i need to have a bigger and more mature conversation about racial sensitivity with him. what if he says to dylan something mean like you look like a monkey when theyre not getting along? i need some ideas on what to say to him about racial sensitivity. i basically want to tell him that calling dylan a monkey is racist and that he should never say it. but i also dont want to teach him that dylan is different from him. advice??	dneums	/r/Mommit/comments/bw7j31/is_my_kid_racist_how_do_i_teach_him_not_to_be/	5	0	0	0.44	1559543376.0

parents of boys tell me why it's great.	hi, i'm an interloper from r/babybumps. i am a ftm and just 12 weeks pregnant with a surprise pregnancy at 38 years old. my husband is 43. we love kids but always assumed we'd probably be childfree or at the most, one and done for lifestyle reasons . we recently found out we are having a boy, and i am experiencing a surprising degree of what i think is called gender disappointment. i really, really expected we were having a girl. i had dreams about her. for my whole life i thought i'd have one child and it would be a daughter. i'm an only child and have a close relationship with my mom, and really wanted the same type of relationship with my child. i love little girls and have never connected with little boys...i've never even had a boy pet . i am a bookish, quiet and introverted person and boys seem hectic, rowdy and physical to me. i have a 9yo nephew via my husband and can't connect to him...he loves fart jokes, wrestling, and video games. i like nature, hiking, gardening, cooking, animals, reading, solitude and quiet time. i've always just loved little girls and had a vision of having a badass, smart, thoughtful, outdoorsy, feminist daughter. when my husband admitted to me he also thought we were having a daughter and was really looking forward to raising a girl , it broke my heart and now i'm just in tears daily over having a boy. i just can't imagine it! it just seems a lot harder to raise a more balanced son, but i know this is my own limited thinking coming into play. i know i will adore my son once he's here but i would love to get over this period of grief more quickly. parents of boys, can you tell me why you love it?

tips for when dad returns to work?	first time poster here! i just had my little girl four days ago and her daddy has to return to work in just two days. its already been a rough couple of first days, and were all still learning and figuring things out. i have really bad anxiety about doing it alone while hes at work. i know people do it every day, but i know nothing about babies and this is all so new to me. shes so fussy and hates sleeping anywhere that is deemed safe. she screams through diaper changes and sometimes she kicks so much that i can hardly manage it. she makes everything a two person job, which makes me scared. how am i going to function with a newborn on my own through the day? what makes it easier? i am so scared and while i do have a great support system, its hard to find anyone available during the weekdays to help out. please give me some tips, im freaking out!	raew1999	/r/Mommit/comments/bwcnr1/tips_for_when_dad_returns_to_work/	15	24	0	0.94	1559579328.0

how do i sleep while my baby is sleeping. help!	every time i lay my little one down for a nap i cant seem to sleep. hes a little over a week old and sleeps a lot. the thing is, i havent been. ive been taking turns watching him with my mom but i need to get use to sleeping when he sleeps for when i go back to work. sometimes it seems like he cries the second i decide to sleep, or i feel like hes going to wake up soon to eat so i might as well stay awake. it would be nice to sleep at night when he does or take naps during the day when he does, but ever coo or tiny cry wakes me up and i swear its like he knows when im trying to sleep and wont let me. he cried all night once unless i held him and i cant sleep with him in my arms cause ill crush him. he sleeps in a bassinet right up next to the side of my bed. how do you do it? any advice would be appreciated.

need tips - 4 month old baby's first time to be outside for 5-6hrs. what to do with his nap schedule?	ftm here. we don't really take our baby outside for more than 2hrs so we can be home for his nap times. however, tomorrow we have to be out as they are cutting the power in our building from 10am til 3pm, because of an annual maintenance thing. so we need to be out. we cannot stay inside as we live in a hot city, and we cannot not have ac. so.. we figured we just go to a mall. they have breastfeeding area there, so i can feed him anytime. but i am worried about his naps. he usually only stays awake 1 to 2 hrs between his naps. we will walk him in his stroller with his car seat. will he be ok? tips please. thanks so much!	eebernal	/r/Mommit/comments/bxl206/need_tips_4_month_old_babys_first_time_to_be/	5	5	0	1.0	1559850244.0

what do pediatricians have against whole milk?	just had my little's two year check up and the doctor asked what kind of milk he drinks. he recently self-weaned, so every once in a while when he asks i give him organic grass-fed whole milk because it's what i keep in the house and is much easier for both him and i to digest. we're talking maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk 1 to 3 times a week, sometimes not at all. the doctor said i should be giving him nonfat or 1%, not whole, and that he should get 3 cups a day. i love his doctor, but i wanted to be snarky and tell him over his dead body unless he wants to change those diapers and blowouts that will surely result! anyone know what the reasoning is behind the recommendation for milk? is the idea to reduce calories and fat? if so, can't i meet that goal by giving him less in quantity? if he truly needs milk for nutrition , wouldn't whole milk have more of it? i just know my body and my life are happier with whole milk. without whole milk, i had to cut out dairy almost completely. plus, it really helps with bloating and blood sugar. i hate to subject my kid to that suffering. it almost seems like the 90's fear-mongering that fat in foods will make you fat. other mommas, what is your take? have your doctors advised the same? tl,dr; pediatrician says whole milk is bad and to give huge quantities of nonfat or 1% instead of whole. where does this idea come from?	highstrunghippie	/r/Mommit/comments/byo3tx/what_do_pediatricians_have_against_whole_milk/	180	118	0	0.91	1560108948.0
moms of multiples , how has your approach to parenting changed post-first kid?	i'm interested in how your approach to breastfeeding, crib/cosleeping, nap habits and strategies, babywearing/strollers, and general discipline has changed. i'm due with my second in january and i'm hoping to skip ahead to that multiple mom wisdom. my first kid never took to bottles, refuses the stroller, cries bloody murder in her car seat unless we play elmo, would only nap on me until 14 months, had to be sleep trained at 7 months , and at 2 now she still wakes up once a night to nurse. she also won't let her dad pick her up or be alone with her for more than like two min. we'll obviously have to work on these things before number two comes. thankfully she at least likes daycare now. moms of multiples, i'd love to hear about the things you're doing differently, or the same, with subsequent kids.

how much formula are we going to go through? west coast usa.	my baby's due in august. for various reasons we've decided to make a go at combo feeding with the expectation that breastfeeding will wane when i return to work. there are a lot of reasons for that and the decision is already made. what i can't quite get a handle on is just how much formula we might be buying per week/month. this will factor in when it comes to what kind of formula we're going to start out having in the house. ideally with combo feeding i'd love to have one of those types that's reported to be closest to breastmilk, like enfamil enspire, but it's a lot more expensive than many other types. i'd still put the money into it if we can afford it, but i can't tell what we might be in for. so let's assume i'm not breastfeeding and would be strictly formula. anyone able to give me an approximate monthly expense for a newborn, a few months in, even six months down the road? thanks everyone.	lunatic_minge	/r/Mommit/comments/c2o01w/how_much_formula_are_we_going_to_go_through_west/	9	3	0	0.67	1560984836.0
three year old makes me wonder what i am doing wrong	hello- i have followed this sub for a while and finally broke down and made an account in hope of some insight. i am a 30 year old mother to three boys, 11, 7, and almost 4. i am not perfect by any means but the 3 year old makes me question everything. i know all children are different, but what i am experiencing i flat out didn't experience with the older two and flat out don't know how to approach anymore. &; my three year old son james is a handful. since the third babysitter quit over his behavior i've gotten the opportunity to stay home and see first hand how it can be overwhelming. &; now, if i am folding laundry he wants to dump the unfolded into the floor, or knock over what has already completed. he likes to spill trash and flood the bathroom sink by filling it with toilet paper and letting the water run. if i go to the bathroom alone i always come out to a mess- cereal, milk, cat food- basically anything he can get his hands on is made into some house-wide artwork. bath time has turned into... i don't know what. even mentioning it he screams bloody murder and grabs onto walls and furniture to prevent going into the bathroom and i swear if i had neighbors they would probably think i was killing him. part of the bathroom fear has made him lose all interest in potty training. he will tell me he has pooped and to change his diaper right now . he has zero interest in nap time and bed time is a challenge. &; he is so incredibly smart! he figured out his 5 point harness last year and gets out of it with ease. we spent probably $600 replacing them but it always ends up the same. we put locks on all cabinets/fridges/doors and he has found a way through those as well. if something is out of his reach he will pull a chair over and climb it and work whatever obstacle he needs to work to get what he wants. waking up to him working on the sliding lock to go outside led to us sliding the couch in front of the door there isn't a form of discipline we have tried that has worked. timeouts make his attitude worse, if we take his toys away he gets angry and takes his frustrations out on his brothers or the family pets. we tried rewarding good behavior but as soon as the reward is given he goes right back to wild child. we've tried ignoring the attitude. i feel like i am being some next level push over but i just don't know how to how to address this anymore. &; he gets all the attention in the world- he is read to, we go to the park or the lake, he and his brothers play wrestle and play with the various toys they have. i set up play dates and he seems to do well with other children when i am there, but that is a rare occurrence for us because we live so far away. i just can't seem to take my eyes off him for two seconds without him destroying something. &; i apologize for the wall of text. &; tl;dr my high energy three year old spends his energy being destructive and nothing i have tried to correct the situation helps .

i'm a mom who doesn't like other children	back story i have a ten year old son who i love but it was not an easy pregnancy. he was born at 10 lbs 6 oz. i had to have a c-section because and i quote my doctor, there is no way he's coming out the normal way . the first year was horrible because he was hungry every 3 hours so i never really slept being the feeding machine . i still loved him but man did i want sleep. the next few years are great because i'm watching his little mind comprehend how life works and i get to teach him. i start realizing that i'm teaching him how to be a good human being but i noticed other people who let their kids run wild and i can't correct them without getting the evil eye from parents. my kid is around these other kids who can do whatever they want and their parents won't care because their phone is more important. this has jaded me because i want him to be safe and unhurt. fast forward to now and we moved from california to the south. i finally get to drop off my son with his grandparents so i can go out with new friends. the subject of kids come up and i said i didn't like kids. you would swear i just said i worship satan to these people and to the nosy people who were eavesdropping. one person said, well don't you have a kid? . i informed them yes but i like mine i just don't like other kids. this was so confusing to them and led to a large discussion with me now not having as many new friends as i thought. it's not like i dislike all children but i can't stand the disrespectful ones. most of the new friends i thought i was making don't have children and don't fully understand what i was saying. am i the only one?		/r/Mommit/comments/c34on7/im_a_mom_who_doesnt_like_other_children/	20	30	0	0.84	1561082692.0

living near freeways with babies/children - advice needed!	hello mommit! looking for some advice - im a soon to be ftm and my husband and i live in southern ca. while were fairly close to the beach our townhome backs directly up to the freeway. its a four lane and we arent in la, but weve started to hear a lot of worrisome statistics about babies and children who are raised so close to freeways due to air pollution, smog, etc. ive also read even being pregnant living so close to the freeway can be unhealthy for the baby, so weve been really concerned as of late. do any of you live near freeways and have experiences you can share, or should we seriously start looking to move? thanks in advance!	katnisseverglean	/r/Mommit/comments/c6kptr/living_near_freeways_with_babieschildren_advice/	11	4	0	1.0	1561731403.0

when you and your spouse are not into holidays...	i saw the santa post on here and it got me thinking about our one and only daughter who will be three soon. she is just now really understanding things and getting excited about stuff. my dh and i are not very big into holidays. dh is against all holidays including b-days. i like to celebrate the silly holidays and i absolutely love thanksgiving but just can't stand christmas. not for anti-religious reasons or anything like that just hate how much money goes into decorating, the anxieties of gift giving and receiving, and having to drive to other peoples houses to eat food you might not want . anywho, we have gotten a lot of flack from family and friends about not throwing ourselves into holidays for our daughters sake. what we once thought was not important during those first couple years now makes me wonder if we might be depriving her of a great experience. i think because dh and i never really enjoyed holidays and the expectations involved with them while growing up, made it easier for us to write them off. so, anyone here grow up not taking part in holidays because of your parents or your own parenting style, what happened or what is happening?

baby won't sleep in bassinet - please help!	i'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me. my baby is about 5 weeks old and he refuses to sleep anywhere but in someone's arms or in the bed next to us. i have tried over and over to put him into the bassinet but no matter how deep of a sleep he is in, he immediately wakes up and fusses and then cries if we don't pick him up. cosleeping scares me to death, i am constantly worried about him and so i can barely sleep well. i just bought one of those in-the-bed co-sleeper things, but i doubt i'll even be able to get him to sleep in that because i can only get him to fall asleep in the bed by side-laying nursing or by shushing him softly directly into his ear, which i can't do when he's in the sleeper. if i adjust him at all once he is asleep he wakes up and fusses. i'm just at such a loss as to what to do. has anyone else delt with this? is there any hope? please send help. edit we use a white noise machine and we swaddle him. it definitely helps him sleep, but doesn't help him transition to the bassinet.

keeping mama bear chained up, especially when it's not your kid	hi ladies, how do you do it? how do you keep the raging mama bear chained up when you see someone lay into their child? i'm going to need tips as my sister in law has now had a child and to see the child, i have to see the child's aunt from the dad's side. she is insanely rough on her little girl for the littlest infractions. for example, all the children were playing on the floor and my 10 mth old was playing with a balloon with the other kids. the girl is like 4 at the most. she steps close to him and stumbles a bit. i didn't worry about it, because if i made it a big deal, my son would have freaked out. he wasn't hurt, she wasn't hurt, nbd. however, her mom begins yelling at her and slapping her arm in time with her words you need to be more careful around the babies!!!! i about went off on her. i don't know if i can hold my tongue again with what i see as child abuse imo. how do i hold myself in check?

what is your mom self care?	my therapist challenged me to take an hour each week to leave the baby with my husband and do something that is entirely not baby related. i had told her my hobbies like scrapbooking my babys first year, and turns out my whole life revolves around baby . basically i have no idea what to do. im supposed to leave the home by myself for an hour? and do what?? the only things i can think of are errands like going to the grocery store or library, and i dont think that is exactly what the therapist has in mind. i dont have a ton of money so i cant go get my nails done or something every week, but maybe occasionally i can do something like that. also, does anyone else feel like the therapy appointment should count? its not weekly, and its not a hobby, but it is self care right?	macandsierra	/r/Mommit/comments/cbm3oo/what_is_your_mom_self_care/	15	5	0	1.0	1562791050.0

please help baby won't sleep in her bed	hey mommies. bless your amazing mommy powers, do you mind sharing some with me? here's the deal since my baby was born we have moved four different times in one year for personal reasons. because of this, and because i am a new mom, baby hasn't always had a bed to sleep in and we got her used to sleeping between myself and my husband . now that we finally have a stable home and a bed set up for her... she refuses to sleep in her own bed. she's one year old, doesn't eat during the night, just hates her bed. our nights go like this baby sleeps in our bed, i take her, put her in her bed, she will wake up after a half-hour crying and i take her out. i've tried putting her in there for nap time during the day, trying to get her comfortable in the bed by reading to her bedtime stories or putting play toys there, tried the cry-out-method, but she cried for two+ hours straight and throws up from crying . moved her bed to our room so she feels like we're still here, didn't work. took the whole side panel off so she could crawl out if she wanted to, still didn't work. aside from getting myself a new mattress to sleep on and letting her have ours, what can i do? i'm so sad. i know i didn't do what good moms are supposed to and sleep train early, but with the constant moving and not having a place to put her because of our situation, it was difficult to do so. any advice would be so appreciated.	sleeplessinmommyland	/r/Mommit/comments/cf2hmy/please_help_baby_wont_sleep_in_her_bed/	11	2	0	1.0	1563507214.0

need hair advice for a biracial child under 3	my daughter is 1 and will be 2 in october. i've been trying different things on her hair since it started growing out. she has a lot of shrinkage and frizz. i brush her hair daily. i'm wary of trying new products in her hair. my sister-in-law gave me some detetangling cream to try on her hair that was supposed to be moisturizing. i thought it was nice at first, but the next day my baby's hair was so brittle, matted, and shrunk down. she's had breakage ever since. when i do a length check in the bathtub, it still comes down past her shoulders. i'm not sure what type of texture she has. when i detangle, the healthier areas look like pencil ringlets. so far what her hair routine is -wash x1 a week with johnson & johnson original shampoo -cowash 3x a week with curly kids super detangle conditioner -use a water spray bottle to refresh and spray half and half mixture of olive oil and castor oil to use as detangler as needed. i don't have to use the oil mixture unless she's had a wash or cowash. -brush her hair 1-2x a day. should i start wrapping her hair when she sleeps? how do you do it?

how do you find steady full time work plus childcare after being a stay at home mom?	i hope you guys can give me some advice and/or helpful info. i've been a stay at home mom for about 2 years. i got fired from my job in retail and never looked for anything else. a few months ago my husband got fired from his job. it was messy. an employee lied about my husband. the company lied to unemployment. he ended up taking a job that was $10 less an hour/$40k less a year. he couldn't find anything that paid better. he only has a highschool diploma. we can no longer make ends meet, and our rent plus this unaffordable health insurance is over 52% of of his take home pay. we can't reduce our expenses anymore. we had just renewed our lease for another year. i started looking for a job, and i have an interview tomorrow. it's retail. they say it's part time. indeed's comments say the hours could be as low as 23 a week and $9.50 an hour. i'm worried about finding and affording childcare for 5 hours a day, 3 days a week. i would have to pay for childcare hourly rather than per day i think? i keep looking at different jobs, and they are either part time or if they are full time, the shifts vary. i don't know what to do. my dad is willing to watch our daughter a couple days a week, but they live 20+ minutes away, and i'm terrified to drive ! my husband starts work too early to take her to daycare or my dad's. i feel stuck and limited by my fears. jobs are either too far away for me or are part time or different shifts. how can i find childcare while i work part time, etc? especially that i can afford? we sure can't afford kindercare. advice? i'm sorry if this isn't the best subreddit, but i didn't know where else to turn. edit well i guess some people don't like me....

struggling with the idea of the baby shower.	new here... soon to be first time mom, baby due in november, i will also be turning 39 shortly before his birth. i just found out that my mil and my husband's godmother will be paying for/hosting my baby shower. to which i am super thankful! i don't have a ton of girlfriends, and my closest family lives many states away and with the exception of my sister, no one has been jumping to offer to help plan anything. my family is small and doesn't family well. i should also prefice this post by stating i suffer from anxiety and have being taking meds to help manage my anxiety for several years now. pretty sure the anxiety problems run in the family. due to a thyroid problem, i truly didn't think that i would be in the position i currently find myself. while i am not at all unhappy with the situation and have been having a relatively easy pregnancy, i know that i don't like being the center of attention, i also struggle with the idea of people/friends/family buying expensive things for my little growing family because i had sex with husband. i know, i know,... and have been told from everyone that i'm looking at the situation the wrong way. i guess what i'm asking is there another way to look at this, a perspective that my irrational brain can come to that will allow me to be less anxious, and not so judgemental towards my very sweet/only wants to be helpful mil? i also understand that we can't afford to buy everything on our own. so the fact that husband's family is being generous doesn't go unnoticed. so the phrase it takes a village is understandable. my rational brain can understand that we can't afford all these things that a baby needs, but part of my older more stubborn self is also like why do we need all this stuff. i want to listen to the wisdom of the been there, done that mom's because, i don't know what i'm doing! but the irrational part of my brain says well you'll figure it out on your own the way you have the whole of your life. like somehow, since i made it this far on my own i can do this first time motherhood business on my own too. not once until this moment has my rational brain even thought why would you even want to do this on your own? like i don't have a choice? why can't i truly believe and understand that this sweet little baby deserves all the nice things and all the love i feel like i never got? i don't want my little boy to miss out on the love and caring friends and family we have in our lives because i didn't have the greatest upbringing. i know that currently i'm allowing my anxiety to make irrational decisions/ formulate thoughts for me and the baby, and that aren't fair! i'm sure i'm working through somethings that needs some professional talk therapy. but suggestions or advise is always welcome. also what advise can you give about inviting close friends that live out of state. in the age of social media and sharing it's hard to know who is really happy for you that you're having a baby...like how much are they willing to participate, and should i even assume that they would want to. hoping to figure this out before september . thanks a bunch!

i don't want to be the mom today	i feel like i have to start off by saying i love my kids. of course i do. they light up my life. they give me a reason to live. they are the reason i get out of bed every morning . id take a bullet for them, blah, blah, blah. yes, of course i love them. it doesnt mean i want to be the mom today. who thought it was a good idea to put me in charge anyway? did it seem that i could keep this under control? because i dont exactly feel qualified. im 37 years old and i still dont know what i want to be when i grow up. what criteria did i meet to consider me capable of taking care of three young kids? what if i dont want to be the mom today? i dont want to try to guess what color cup you want to drink out of today. because yesterday the princess cup was fine but today it isnt? i dont want to break up fights because your brother went into your minecraft world and ruined yourwhatever youre talking about. i still know nothing about minecraft. i dont want to clean the bathroom because you decided to play with my makeup and smear lipstick all over the counter, mixing it with the half tube of toothpaste you couldnt manage to get on the toothbrush. i dont want to get yelled at because i ate the last ice cream bar. the only one i had out of a pack of twelve. you know, the pack that i bought and you had 3 of yesterday? i dont want to have to explain to you for the 500th time that you need to plug in your tablet when it dies or else it wont charge. how hard is that? it needs power to work. give it some power! and stop throwing a damn fit every time it dies. plug. it. in. i dont feel like making dinner only to be told that its gross. look, you liked stir-fry last time i made it. why is it disgusting now? and no, you cant have something else. this isnt a restaurant. either eat it or go to bed hungry. ive provided the food, its on you to eat it. i dont want to put them to bed. i wish they would put themselves to bed. stop screaming that you arent tired and that you dont want to go to bed. for your whole life you have gone to bed. why would tonight be any different? clearly you need sleep, grumpy pants. but then they finally, finally go to sleep. you see their little eyelids slowly shut and their breathing get shallow. a bit of drool forms on the pillow and all is quiet. finally. your heart fills with love and you take in their smell . you take in the beauty that you created and cant help but be overwhelmed by their presence. ok, i guess ill be the mom tomorrow.	jessicah3282	/r/Mommit/comments/cgv8xo/i_dont_want_to_be_the_mom_today/	10	35	0	0.94	1563901174.0

how do i stop a thumb sucker?	do any other mom's have tips to get my 7 year old to stop sucking his thumb? over the years he has had periods where he has stopped but then something happens and he starts back up. he typically does it when he's falling asleep or tired while watching tv on the couch. i have asked his doctor and she recommended just giving him a pep talk. we have given him prizes to earn for when he stops. we gave him alternative things to do, like hide your hand under your pillow, snuggle up with a stuffed animal. i have tried asking nicely, i have tried sounding irritated, i've asked him to only do it in his room. his new responses are i can't help it and i can if i want to . i am worried for his teeth. any tips i can try would be really appreciated! thank you!

when should i start giving my baby vitamin drops? 	first time mom here and exclusively breastfeeding a 9 month old. i also live in the ph she never took vitamin c or iron supplements yet, and so far, she never had any fever, flu or anything. her vaccines are updated and her next shot is next week though. recently, because of the unpredictable weather, she had some colds and runny nose. i asked my sis in law who is nurse what to give her, and she told me not to give her anything but soup or make her sip calamansi juice, and just breastfeed. so i did just that, and in two days, her colds were gone. my sis in law told me as long as im ebf, her immune system is strong and wont need vitamins yet. but my husband's grandma wants to start giving her vitamins as early as possible so she can get used to it. i kinda agree with my sister in law though since my chubby kiddo is now healthy and fine without any vitamins, but i see grandma's perspective and most babies take vitamins too. im just confused. what is better? i am not anti vitamins, just scared i might do something wrong.	sunnynightmares	/r/Mommit/comments/ciqcvz/when_should_i_start_giving_my_baby_vitamin_drops/	13	1	0	1.0	1564280291.0

need help waking up five year old	kindergarten starts in about a month. it will be our first time with 2 drop offs . it means we will have a lot less flexibility in the morning and need to get out of the house and moving faster than we do now. the 5 year old is more often than not terrible to wake up. a good day is 5-10 minutes of me in her room calling her and shaking/patting/nudging etc. many days are 20+ minutes of this. days she gets up on her own are awesome and i know she can bish teeth, get dressed and brush her hair without assistance. i aim to wake her at 6 45. i may need to move that up and adjust bedtime but sleep isnt the main problem she is up every weekend at 6 50-7 no problem and some nights she can lay in bed for a while before falling asleep. i blame dad for this. he is also near impossible to wake up so she got it from him. do five year olds successfully use alarm clocks? if i could get her moving on her own in a reasonable time it would be a huge game changer. she said she was nervous about the sound but excited over being a big girl that got herself ready. is it expecting too much of a 5 year old to use an alarm clock and get moving on their own in the am. obviously its not like id be sleeping. id be up and and available and getting ready myself, but no more 20 minute wake ups seems major in keeping our mornings sane and less hectic. if not an alarm any other ideas? we already do other basic time saving things. close are picked out night before breakfast is simple or something ive batch cooked ahead so her waking up is my last major hurdle. this may have turned a little rambling i think my other kindergarten anxieties are coming out as well, but that is another post entirely.	rmc1848	/r/Mommit/comments/cjexh5/need_help_waking_up_five_year_old/	8	8	0	0.83	1564423520.0
calling all pinterest-y moms, what kinds of baby items do you keepsake?	i was talking to my cousin about how expensive keepsake baby ornaments were, especially if you monogram them... she said that she just turns normal items into ornaments. she adds a ribbon loop and then sharpies the date somewhere. mostly she did this for vacations, but i think it could work for baby things too. soooo, what kinds of baby items would you turn into a christmas ornament if you could ?	mrmses	/r/Mommit/comments/cjk7s2/calling_all_pinteresty_moms_what_kinds_of_baby/	2	0	0	0.5	1564447712.0

advice on dealing with a friend	i have a close friend of almost 12 years. we were in each others weddings and hang out with 3 other girls on the regular. a few years ago this friend and i both wanted to start a family and i got pregnant first while she had trouble. i told her that i was pregnant in a private conversation so if she was upset she wouldnt feel that she had to act happy. i purposely did not post things or text in a group chat about my pregnancy and watched everything i did or said when we were together to ensure that she didnt feel bad. one time we were in a group chat and a different friend mentioned a get together before i had the baby to celebrate and she immediately left the group chat. throughout my pregnancy she started to go through fertility treatments and made a few lifestyle changes to help with her fertility and i was 100% supportive. well when it came time for my baby shower she told me she just couldnt imagine attending my baby shower and that it was too hurtful right now but sent a nice gift. when i had my daughter, she came to the hospital and was excited for us. a few months later she announced her pregnancy. i went to her shower, visited her at the hospital and went to the baptism but i just still feel upset that she treated me. i have been trying to get over it but i just havent. she asked a mutual friend if i was okay because she hadnt seen me all summer and she said yes. i have a feeling tho that she is going to ask me about it tomorrow because i will be seeing her. i dont know how to respond that im still upset with the way that she treated me but i also dont feel like theres anything she can do now to make it right. i just have to get over it which im having a hard time doing. would you get over something like this or just distance yourself from her?	slp_in_the_house	/r/Mommit/comments/ckx1it/advice_on_dealing_with_a_friend/	6	4	0	0.75	1564707134.0
how badly did having a second kid f@& your life?	my daughter is four months old and we're starting to talk about timing for a second one, how soon we want to try and such. my period is coming back and quite frankly, i'm over it. i want to pop out all the kids i'm gonna have and shut down the factory. we also posited that it would be nice to get the baby/diaper/potty training stage out of the way in one big chunk, rather than re-starting the process. we're not doing great financially, but we're getting by. i just got a $2/hour raise at work, but i do not have paid time off or maternity leave . i'm also going to school, online this semester although i've taken in person classes in the past. i'm in a transfer program so it would be nice to get my pregnancies out of the way before i get to the big school. it's a lot, i know. so how much more would a second child add? financially, how does one to two compare to the jump from 0 to one? mentally? i want to take my mirena out around christmas and hopefully be pregnant around february. are we completely nuts?? talk us into/out of this!		/r/Mommit/comments/cl3qw6/how_badly_did_having_a_second_kid_f_your_life/	10	4	0	0.75	1564750523.0

advice needed about sensitive kids	my 4yr old son gets really really hurt when kids dont want to play with him. not on the playground with strangers, but with his cousins. when they abandon play he is heartbroken and doesnt get why, since usually the whole visit was planned around the kids playing. hes very social and loves to play with my nephews on either side. today we visited the house of the 6yr old for his moms birthday and halfway through my nephew hid behind the bathroom door and told my son he didnt want to play with him, but would play later. this lasted for half an hour and my son was super tired and not feeling well to begin with. he had a meltdown and couldnt deal, just sat outside the door and cried my nephews name. finally i told my husband we needed to go home and we left quickly. we were watching them play and nothing happened between the boys, but my nephew was upset because he was scolded by his stepdad about something else. my husband thinks our son should just learn how to deal when kids dont want to play. so my question is, how do i help with him this? hes a kind hearted kid and i can see him being hurt easily by friends later on in life. i also know kids arent obligated to play with him and i need to teach him to deal with disappointment. i told him you cant make kids play, if they dont want to play you just have to find something else to do and i gave him a few options.	o_o_odessa	/r/Mommit/comments/cm4u6a/advice_needed_about_sensitive_kids/	4	4	0	0.83	1564970491.0
is anyone else underweight from breastfeeding? weaning advice when you aren't ready to fully stop breastfeeding?	i have a tl;dr at the end indicated by a line break and an arrow emoji that also asks my main question. these next few paragraphs are just what i wrote to pass the time as i sadly shoveled cheerios in my mouth even though i wish i was asleep. it's 2 45 in the morning and i'm awake...it is stormy outside and it woke my son up. he screamed and cried for so long that i had to breastfeed finally to get him back to sleep, although i've been trying not to breastfeed in the night anymore. he is 15 months old. the breastfeeding journey has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life. he doesn't fully sustain on breastmilk...mouth full of teeth and we feed him real food frequently. we share basically anything we eat as he isn't picky and has no allergies known. he has always free fed and i'm fine with that. i love it, usually. but i need to be able to sustain a certain weight and i'm failing at it. i am 5' 5/ and 110.3 pounds. i've always been thin but ideally i'd weigh at least 10 more pounds, maybe 15. my hair is thin and lifeless. my face looks sunken. my skin is thin and rough and red and i have some adult acne which has never been an issue for me. i have one huge boob and one tiny one. my loved ones tell me i look fine or even beautiful and not to worry; i visited my aunt and uncle in north carolina though and a few days in to my visit said they were honestly surprised to realize as they watched me eat and eat and never leave to puke that i wasn't anorexic or bulimic...which they said had been their initial thoughts when they saw me for the first time in over a year. so riddle me that. do i really look okay or are they just trying to tell me what they think i want to hear? i'm suffering from a month long bout of depression. i feel like my health is being negatively impacted. i want to breastfeed for 2 years if i can . i'm losing too much weight . tips to get my frequent flier free feeding son to slow it down a bit? tips to help me bulk up? i don't exercise. i'm very poor so i want bang for my buck snack and meal ideas if you've got em. i'm also a poor cook so simple snacks and meals are good.	dale_everyheart	/r/Mommit/comments/cm8mha/is_anyone_else_or_have_you_been_underweight_from/	15	5	0	0.86	1564996000.0
how do i get my kid to poop on the toilet?	my 3.5 year old has been potty trained when it comes to peeing for about a year. no accidents. everything is perfect. at the time we also tried to get her to poop on the potty or toilet, but she refused and would hold it for days. we figured she was not ready and allowed her to poop in a diaper. basically she comes tell us she needs to poop, we put a diaper on her, she goes to the bathroom and stands next to the toilet. the end. now that shes 3.5 and our second baby will be here soon and she needs to be fully potty trained for kindergarten we really would like her to poop on the toilet. we tried going cold turkey but she freaks out and just holds it for days. we figured wed take a step back and have her wear a diaper but at least sit on the toilet while going. same freak out. she basically just wants to stand up. sitting seems to be the issue. no amount of bribing has swayed her. we tried sitting with her and reading a book or singing songs or letting her watch something on the ipad. but she still just holds it and whines/cries til shes allowed to stand up again. i asked her what she is afraid of or what she doesnt like but all she says is i dont want to sit down. when i ask why she says i just dont want to. her poops are nice and normal. not painful. her feet are supported by a stool. we read books about going to the toilet. and often times we just back off completely. the latest thing were doing is setting a timer for one minute and have her sit for at least one minute before shes allowed to stand up. basically hopefully getting her used to sitting. maybe extending that time in the future. were kind of at a loss... anyone got any tips?	swirly023	/r/Mommit/comments/cm91le/how_do_i_get_my_kid_to_poop_on_the_toilet/	11	3	0	0.8	1564999235.0

my theory on why connecting with other moms is hard	i find it hard to get to know other mom's because we are all so busy hiding our authentic selves in order to come off as this good influence that society now expects us to be. we don't swear, we don't admit our true feelings, and we don't show our cards for fear of being judged by the bad mom police. it's isolating and makes it really hard to connect. most of my friends are people who i've known since we were in our 20's. to the outside world, they seem just like all of the other mom's i meet cookie cutter and predictable. but since i know them in a deeper level i see this whole other side to them, and they know me as a full authentic person, that's more than just a mom. i really doubt that if we met today we would have this deep of a friendship. maybe it's because we hold so much in to try to keep a strong front for our kids, i dunno. but sometimes i wonder, of all these mom's in my kids class who seem relatively alike, which one i would actually enjoy hanging out with if we were able to be more honest about who we are. anyone relate to this?	lholly14	/r/Mommit/comments/cs4xof/my_theory_on_why_connecting_with_other_moms_is/	107	382	0	0.98	1566152583.0

hi mommit, i'm desperate for advice regarding finding child care, can you guide me?	hi all! i don't think i've posted here before but i'm a mom to a 16 month old and have been a part time stay at home mom this entire time. my partner has had a great job for over 6 months now that he expects to stay with long term, but we are barely living paycheck to paycheck and i need to work more. the problem is that there is absolutely no way to afford childcare right now and we feel so stuck! currently i'm able to work a few hours a week as a cleaner for a rental turnover where i can bring my son with me and ideally if i could find a solution to my childcare problem i could pick up almost unlimited hours a week and really fill that gap. i'm just at a total loss though. my plan today is to get on the app nextdoor and see if i can meet anyone that can help but the idea does make me so nervous. i'm also thinking of trying peanut but i don't know if that's too weird a place to try to find a mom that can help? i'm wondering what advice you guys can give me as i know i'm not the first woman to ever have this predicament. plenty of mom's figure it out and yet here i am. i have tried asking my wic office for resources before but they acted like i was the first parent to ever ask about childcare help thanks in advance for any advice or creative ideas to get this mom providing for her family!!	captainmalamute	/r/Mommit/comments/cudz5b/hi_mommit_im_desperate_for_advice_regarding/	5	3	0	1.0	1566567311.0
not sure where to post this? nsfw 	i had a c-section three weeks ago and am on my way to recovering. i am obviously heeding the no sex until 6 weeks rule, as i dont want anything to go wrong. however; my sex drive is so high right now. i feel like a freaking teenager with how much i am craving sex. ive read that clitoral stimulation can be okay post-cesarian, but that it can also be harmful to your stitches if your uterus contracts too aggressively. i tend to have pretty intense orgasms. my question to you ladies is have any of you delivered c-section and successfully masturbated without incident with strong orgasms? idk how much longer i can wait before i go out of my mind. 	emmymoose	/r/Mommit/comments/cuf2sd/not_sure_where_to_post_this_nsfw_ish/	4	4	0	1.0	1566572551.0

new baby sleeping advice wanted!	my lo is a week old today. he sleeps fantastic in his bassinet during the day and takes great naps, but when nighttime rolls around, he will not sleep in it. i don't know what to do. i've tried swaddling, arms in and out, not swaddling. more clothes, less clothes. putting him in awake and in a deep sleep. i don't get it. he just won't stay in it, which is leading to either no sleep for me or co-sleeping, which i'm not super fond of with him still being so little. this isn't my first, but my other children didn't give me problems at night like this.

super fussy eater - need help with different foods / tactics	my 8 year old is such a fussy picky eater - she will eat all / most of what i give her if she enjoys the meal which consist of nuggets/fish fingers mash and veg even pizza is hot and miss pasta with plain sauce chicken breast with mash and veg sausages with mash and veg and thats it in rotation. i cant get her to try anything else and even so with the above meals sometimes takes lots of prompting to finsh. im drained of battles at dinner times. i have 2 smaller children who eat any thing everything and if they leave something it will just be they are under the weather or not hungry but this is very rare and even so theyve had a good go at eating - they will eat way more than my eldest and are 6 years younger than her. shes talks loads which i allow her to do a bit - then tell her no more eat up shes starting to look really skinny compared to kids her age and i dont like the amount of processed things i am giving her does anyone have any suggestions or advice? i have tried everything but am looking to start again no snacks until after dinner if youve had dinner something for afters and are hungry a bit later id offer a sandwich cereal toast or another snack. or maybe offer a piece of fruit before dinner? and if not eaten no pudding and nothing else? if she was a picky eater but had a good go i wouldnt be worried or a good weight. any positive advice would be greatly received. thanks 	oprahclear	/r/Mommit/comments/cyf9vf/super_fussy_eater_need_help_with_different_foods/	3	1	0	1.0	1567370522.0

i just dont know what to do about daycare.	my daughter started daycare at almost 2 years old last november. she has been to three so far. this is her fourth one but it's one she has been to before. the first daycare constantly sick. the kids were all kids of the owner. a few other points i can't remember now. the third the kids were left alone often, tv was a staple, sugary snacks were a bribing tool and my two year old girl was getting bullied and being called a boy for not having earrings. no teacher even knew until i brought it up. second/fourth daycare almost always getting sick, no consistent teachers, student to staff ratio consistently off, the past three pick ups her pull up had not been changed at all. she chipped her front tooth and no one even knew until i brought her back like wtf is this. i let that go because it was 80% my fault. today has just put me over the top. i left her pants unbuttoned/unzipped because i forgot. they were still open when i picked her up and her diaper had not been changed all day. she now has an itchy butt hole. also, her teacher has like 15 other kids and no help. we left the first time because we moved to the other side of the city, the only issue before then was the front tooth and getting sick. i don't want to switch yet again. vetting these daycares is hard when you work full-time and she turns 3 in march so i can finally send her to a private preschool. i just don't know what to do. edit formatting		/r/Mommit/comments/d2gmz7/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_about_daycare/	8	3	0	0.67	1568158065.0

im a young mom who recently graduated and needs an advice!	maybe somebody knows how i could proceed here, bc i am really in a big dilemma now and everything in my mind is spinning around this. 3years ago i became a mother, it was in the middle of my masters studies . i graduated in international relations with a double degree but bc besides some journalist experience i couldnt do any internships during this time . i got my degree end of 2018 and after this wanted to do a phd but got very sick and hat to put it away for 3 months. my mentor, a professor, told me, that a phd would not be the best way for the job market. i wanted to go more in the direction of law, so she suggested to pursue a law degree in addition to have better chances after this than in international relations. i really liked this idea , and got a place for law at a good university. but my family told me i had to look for a job now , i would be already 34 when finishing law, and this is too old and maybe i wont finish it even and than will have nothing in the end. no job experience. so in summer break i started to look out for a job to see how my chances are and now i am really devestated. no interview so far but in an it-company next week. not exactly the type of direction i wanted to go and now my dilemma are thoughts of trying this it-thing or really follow my heart to pursue law to get better chances for work i am more interested in. i am thinking if rationally law would make sense. dont want to be selfish or something. but now i dont have other options. only option is looking longer for a job. but it looks hard so far... plus i am a mother and not that flexible.. sort of stuck right now. would like to hear some thoughts. maybe someone has similar experience? thanks a lot!!!	mariajudyta	/r/Mommit/comments/d2uouu/im_a_young_mom_who_recently_graduated_and_needs/	5	4	0	0.83	1568226729.0

how do i set appropriate boundaries with my friend who has made me feel that she is trying to live through my pregnancy? 	 hello! i'm currently 21 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. this is my first pregnancy. i need help approaching a friend on how i am uncomfortable with some of her...actions during my pregnancy. i've known her for less than a year , we were coworkers at local super store. i no longer work there but she does. she and her husband have been trying for a second baby for decent amount of time. she has fertility problems. she has had 2 miscarriages because of this. which i can empathize. well, me and my fianc started trying this year cause we're both in comfortable positions in our lives. it happened fairly quickly honestly, got a positive on may 28th! only our second attempt trying. well she came over to pick me up to hang out at her place after the day of the positive test. the only person i had told at this time was my sister, i was only 5weeks so no need to go around blabbing. before we headed to her place, she needed to use my bathroom. ok cool. she does her thing and we head out. as we're driving, she turns to me and ask when i was going to tell her i was pregnant. i was caught off guard. i asked her how did she know?? she had seen the clearblue pregnancy wrapper sitting in my trashcan and had gone through my trash seeing my positive test. i know the test was buried in my trash. i kinda just shrugged it off and told her yes i was and i was only 5 weeks. she got super excited for me and congratulated me. she then started rabbling off how how i could have all her baby stuff that she doesn't need any more or doesn't need at the moment. then as we're hanging out, she insists that i will be having a gender reveal party and a baby shower both thrown by her and inviting her family and ex-coworkers. i try to tell her i don't want a gender reveal party, i don't like them .she then tries to push it on me that she will be throwing me one. an that i basically had no say on the subject. i kinda just shrug it off, i'm not a confrontational person. then maybe a week later after this hang out, i finally text her that my fianc and mother will be the ones throwing a shower and we're not doing a gender reveal. she still tries to push it,but luckily over text i can assert myself better and kindly tell her no. she still insists on helping with the shower at least, whatever. another week passes, i go over to hang out again. by this time i'm 7-8weeks and i have told a good handful of close family and friends. i mean... i am estatic about my pregnancy, it's my first and im going yo be a mom! d . so it's hard to keep quiet. well the conversations turns to how many people i told, i tell her a fair amount by now and she immediately quips well be careful because you could miscarry. i know she meant well by this comment because most don't tell others til about they are about 12weeks. yet, i'm having a pretty healthy pregnancy so far other than the morning sickness.. and if something bad happens i do have a good support system. i just think her comment was unnecessary and it just rained on my parade. i went quiet after her comment and the subject changed to who do i want in the room with me during labor. i said at the moment, just my fianc cause it is a very imitate moment for us. she then says she will be in the room with me. i laughed it off and said o well... i'm still not sure who i want. conversation continues but then she still brings up me miscarrying 3 more times before i finally went home. i just noted after that not to bring up my pregnancy in front of her. after this though i try to go limited contact with her. she then literally threatens showing up to my apartment if i don't answer. i kinda just suck it up during this time and hang out with her, cause she is a good person... its these little things. her most recent thing that has made me upset and uncomfortable is calling my baby by her kid's name plus jr it made me really really really uncomfortable. her son is very smart and sweet and i love playing with him... it just really got under my skin that she called my kid that. i feel that is just my hormones and being irrationally irked. what i really want to know is how can i approach her that she is making me uncomfortable with her actions and how i can set the appropriate boundaries without hurting her feelings or should i just cut her out entirely?

please help me identify this blanket!	hi redditors! i need help identifying this item description pink baby blanket in polyester, with decorative sewing in white thread. decorative eyes on one corner, and an appendix of the same fabric in the other. this appendix is the most important part. if you can find a blanket with this part but everything else different, it'll work too! there are no tags are anything else with text or numbers. can't remember if it had and was ripped off, or if it never had. size 87 cm by 84 cm, or 34 by 33 inches. i can provide more photos and details if needed. backstory when my daughter was born, 3 years ago, we received a lot of gifts and free samples. among them was this baby blanket. she took to it and it is now her comfort item. she sleeps with it every night, she named it and even named the little part that sticks out in one of the corners . ever since then, i have been looking for this blanket so we can have a replacement if we need to. i reached out to everyone who gifted us presents but no-one remembers gifting this. i believe this may have been a gift that came with some baby related product, but my google-fu returned nothing useful. this baby blanket is now showing evident signs of wear and tear, and although it is still in good shape i fear for the day it rips. i know that dealing with loss is part of a child's development, but i would rather my girl chooses to give up her comfort blanket instead of having it break and be left without a choice. so please, people of reddit, help me find this pink blanket somewhere where i can purchase it! if you find a better place for me to post this please let me know. thank you!	klzblz	/r/Mommit/comments/db9mkq/please_help_me_identify_this_blanket/	5	2	0	1.0	1569839846.0
how do i not compare my baby to others?	i am my own worst critic. more than your average person. i have terrible anxiety and it absolutely is going into my parenting. not in a helicopter parent way, but i'm self-depreciating way. my son is 8 months old. he is advanced in some ways, average in others, and behind in others. for example, he has held his own bottle since five months. he now can do the single hand hold . he's very independent and has always loved standing. if we put our hands on his hips he can walk, he just needs help with stability. but he's not crawling or pulling up. so i see parents posting about kids his age or younger crawling all over the place and pulling up on everything and i worry about him. i only see where he's behind, not where he's ahead. why can't he crawl? he kind of can, a bit of an army crawl, but he doesn't realize it. why won't he crawl? why is pulling up so hard? he can do it on my shirt but not on our furniture. is it the furnitures fault? my fault? does he watch too much tv? what am i doing wrong? i love him and want the best for him. how do i get it??	fluteitup	/r/Mommit/comments/dbbj6a/how_do_i_not_compare_my_baby_to_others/	11	4	0	1.0	1569849971.0
seeking advice on diaper overflow at night issue...	my 11 week old has been sleeping 7 30pm until approximately 6am for about a week now. im not holding my breath that this will last, but as long as it does, i imagine well be having this diaper issue. i change her into a clean diaper right before putting her in her bassinet, but because she sleeps through the night, when we pick her up in the morning her pjs are wet and her bassinet sheet is wet. i dont want to wake her in the middle of the night to change her because i feel like that would seriously disrupt her sleep cycle . a friend recommended putting her to bed in the next diaper size up, but she would swim in a bigger size and i imagine shed leak even worse. we only just got her into size 1s so she would swim in a 2. weve tried multiple brands with the same issue. does anyone have any other suggestions? or do i just need to wake her up for a midnight change?

when do i start to enjoy being a mum?	let me start by saying i know i am incredibly lucky as there are couples out there desperate for children. that makes me feel all the worse for feeling how i do. my daughter was a surprise at a rough time in my life. pregnancy was rough as i have chronic illnesses and mental health conditions. from birth until 1, we had no idea she had a cows milk protein allergy. she was refluxy, restless, unhappy and screamed at me 90% of the time. i was diagnosed with postpartum depression and got treatment. we dont have a great amount of family support due to ill health and loss of a parent in both my husband's and my own family. husband works and commutes and often has to work over a week without a day off. my health visitor is an absolute angel and got me a couple of hours a day for daughter at nursery. but it just seems to go in so quickly and then i'm left with this tantrum filled monster who thrashed and hits and screams like a banshee. i try planning activities but she is not interested at all. when i move across the room, she follows me and clings to my leg making it difficult to do anything. i try spending time with her reading etc but she grabs the book off me and walks away. she is so demanding that i often forget to take medication because i am so busy with her and i go too long without eating and drinking. i feel as though my life is an endless cycle of her care, housework, to do lists and then crashing out asleep. i guess motherhood is just not at all what i pictured and i am struggling to enjoy it. i feel really alone and i just wanted to post to see if any other mums had gone through this.	mumandtonic	/r/Mommit/comments/dbci8s/when_do_i_start_to_enjoy_being_a_mum/	4	9	0	1.0	1569854338.0

when is an appropriate age to set rules for food?	i know the title is confusing. i have two 18 month old boys that are starting to become picky eaters. i make one meal and its a rule for our three year old that he has to try everything because i dont want to be making separate meals for everyone. i do make kid friends foods at every meal so they can eat at least one thing they like. so, with my twins they are starting to refuse to eat a lot of things. when that happens ive been giving them things like fruit and granola bars so they at least eat something. im wondering when its appropriate to start implementing the same rule we use for our three year old? i really dont want to start giving them just snacks because they refuse to eat what i make. any advice would be greatly appreciated	Growing_up_baker	/r/Mommit/comments/dceu1s/when_is_an_appropriate_age_to_set_rules_for_food/	12	19	0	0.95	1570043393.0

how do you stay on top of things? feeling defeated today.	so... i have a toddler that just started attending school a month ago and a 5 month old. we came back from summer vaca and i felt totally optimistic about being organized, having a schedule, keeping up with errands, housework, cooking etc etc. yes i am a sahm. tbh i've always had the luxury of hired help i hope that doesn't come across as shallow. in our culture its a norm so we grew up that way. we have always had someone come by a few times a week to help. since we came back i haven't had that help hence the optimism maybe was slightly unrealistic. i thought i would totally rock it. i always tell myself so many people don't even have help, i'm lucky i have family closeby and a helpful husband. yet i find myself constantly wondering how do other moms do it? single moms? working moms? i get to stay at home and i'm complaining?! today i'm tired. physically, mentally, emotionally. just tired. i try to be organized, i try to schedule my week. every morning i wake up happy and optimistic that today will be different and i'm gna do it. by nightfall i doubt myself. i write grocery lists, buy what i need, come home and realize there's something missing. instead of two supermarket visits i end up with almost daily quick visits. i write weekly menus of when i'll cook and then find i don't have the time and whenever this happens i feel i'm coming short especially for my toddler who comes home from school and should have two more meals before bed time. i try to organize her toys and they end up in a messy pile every other day. attempts attempts attempts. my 5 month old needs to start eating soon and the thought of an extra to do on my list is overwhelming atm. i bought a whiteboard weekly calender, got binders to organize my papers and whatever else, constantly write to do lists and grocery lists. i simply don't know where to go from here. i think i got carried away so if you read all of the above thanks! mainly i'm here for tips and advice and personal experiences. i just want to know what do you do to keep it all together? tldr need some tips on how to organize and schedule my life as a mom from laundry to grocery shopping to running errands.	zouzee	/r/Mommit/comments/dcuz42/how_do_you_stay_on_top_of_things_feeling_defeated/	24	11	0	0.92	1570127451.0
how to avoid sleep crutches?	hello fellow mamas. i have a nine week old who is experiencing her first week of sleep regression. hooray! as expected, i've been doing some research on sleep training methods. i know she's too young for any method that relies on consistent self-soothing, but i keep seeing one piece of advice that i think may already be coming into play sleep crutches. every method, no-cry, fading, pick-up put-down, and cry-it-out, warns against letting your baby rely on a crutch, like rocking or nursing to sleep. the same books/articles also say not to start their methods until baby is 4+ months old. my question is this how are you supposed to get your baby to sleep in those first months without them getting used to a crutch, if you also can't use any of the no-crutch methods? my baby is already almost entirely reliant on her swing to get to sleep. i've been trying to gently wean her off of it by nursing her to sleep either when she first goes to bed or after night-time feedings, but that doesn't seem sustainable long-term either. should i just bounce her between crutches so she can get to sleep without getting too used to any one thing? what's a sleep-deprived mom to do in those first few months?

any available resources to help me educate my 3.5ish year old son?	i'll admit that i'm a scatterbrain and teaching/explaining anything is not my best skill, and i tend to forget what topics would be good for him to learn at his age. i just want to start helping him get a head start on his education. he's not in preschool yet and he's never been to daycare. i'm hoping someone has some advice to a good resource that can help me teach him a well rounded variety of topics. it doesn't need to be free either.

how does everyone feel about co-sleeping?	its 8am and i wake up to my 1yo like this and i can stare at her forever. lol. i want to crawl back in to bed & cuddle with her. i'm kinda nervous posting this bc idk what the general opinon on it is here & i have to say i've been attacked before. imo, i've done it with all 4 of my kids. never had problems transitioning them to a bed, and it was what worked for our family. at one point, i bought a king size bed so me, my 3 year old, and one year old could all fit. now my 3yo is in his own bed, but those were some of the best times. cuddling with them, talking & giggling till we fell asleep, watching them sleep. the list goes on. i know there's a lot of people who are against it and tbh i can't say i blame them, given the reasons why. but for my family it's just always what's worked. what do you think?		/r/Mommit/comments/dgvg8w/how_does_everyone_feel_about_cosleeping/	89	31	0	0.74	1570888524.0

advice needed how to stop toddler waking up and staying up at 4am.	my daughter is 18 months and so far has been a fairly decent sleeper. she goes to bed a 7, our bedtime routine is simple and solid and she used to wake up around 7. which was perfect as i work from home in the evenings. however, in the last 2-3 months she has been waking up increasingly early and now wakes at 4am. i'm not an early riser, i'm 8 months pregnant and struggling. i can get her back to sleep in my arms but as soon as she is back in bed she screams. she is clearly tired but refuses to go back down. any help or sympathetic ear would be welcome.	ala7686	/r/Mommit/comments/di4a29/advice_needed_how_to_stop_toddler_waking_up_and/	7	2	0	1.0	1571124238.0

can you avoid ageing super fast when you become a parent?	hi all, i've noticed that in the 6 months since my baby was born i aged in dog years. i haven't heard many parents talk about this and i accept that it is part and parcel of parenting. i'm wondering if this is something other parents also reflect on in privately and whether there are any remedies for reversing the cosmetic damage of ageing to any extent. i'm 31 years of age and have got loads of white hair since becoming a parent compared to my friends who are the same age and are not parents as they look 8 years younger than me. i want to have a second child at some point in the next two years and at this rate i'm not sure if i will be able to look in the mirror after the second child. please share your experiences	Stewibaby	/r/Mommit/comments/dkg44g/can_you_avoid_ageing_super_fast_when_you_become_a/	7	8	0	0.83	1571553803.0
no more milk how to satisfy a toddler?	so, im about 21 weeks pregnant with 2. 20 month old toddler has loved milkies since day one, and shes obviously not really prepared for this breastfeeding relationship to end. ive noticed my supply tanking over the past month, and its gotten to the point im pretty sure ive dried up. so. weve always been ebf, and never really done bottles. should i have her ride this weaning period out, or should we look into having some milk on hand for those occasional times she just wants warm milk? on one hand i feel like shes growing up, and she doesnt need an artificial nipple, but on the other, i want her to have a safe, secure, and comforting go to for when shes teething or feverish. thoughts very much appreciated!	havefloofwilltravel	/r/Mommit/comments/dko1rf/no_more_milk_how_to_satisfy_a_toddler/	14	0	0	0.5	1571598102.0

since when is kindergarten so freaking stressful?!	hey ladies, im here to pick your brains! this is going to be long, i apologize in advance. so my five year old daughter just received her first report card, and its really not good. she is attending a pretty competitive private school, and i knew she wasnt where they want her, but some of it completely shocked me. they work off a three point system, 1 means below level grade standard, 2 developing grade level standard and 3 is meeting grade level standard. 12 subjects, including electives. i honestly expected her to receive 2s in writing and reading, as they were expected to go into k having sight words, alphabet writing and knowing letter sounds. i knew she wasnt there in august when she started, but she has picked everything up quickly, imo. well, she got two 1s and nine 2s. ok, not the end of the world. but most of the skills under each subject she received needs improvements as well. even in things like following directions, respecting authority, understanding direction and demonstrating age appropriate behavior. i dont get it. it just doesnt sound like my kid, you know? shes a really good girl. loud, a chatterbox, but shes 5! she also is obsessed with what shes learning. she takes it upon herself to review her sight words, practice writing and even practice writing and answering addition problems. on top of her independent studying we do about 15 minutes of homework together most evenings. we read together every night. ive been incredibly pleased with her progress, and incredibly impressed with her dedication. she really is a very bright girl, and i feel like ive failed her. i stopped working about a year ago, so shes been home with me since then. i know we could have done more preparation for k, but again she picked it up so quickly, i really thought she was a 2 student. in your experience, are there typical requirements for kindergarten? would you be concerned? prior to the report card, i had already discussed getting her extra help with her teacher, as her weekly assignments seemed to be receiving a lot of 1s. she is slated to start working with the title 1 resource teacher, but it was at my request, not initiated by her teacher. i dont want to overreact, but im concerned. opinions and experiences, please! signed, an eight month pregnant mom that is feeling remarkably below average. 	megish1010	/r/Mommit/comments/dn5bue/since_when_is_kindergarten_so_freaking_stressful/	7	6	0	0.88	1572044343.0

newborn preemie + antivax sil, need advice	 disclaimer- i am not looking for a debate on vaccinations. i am looking to see if anyone has had a similar situation and how it was handled when a close family member has a different lifestyle crossposting to r/beyondthebump as well as the title states, i have a newborn preemie . he decided to come six weeks early in a very traumatic experience for us. he spent four weeks in the nicu but is now home and doing wonderfully, but still incredibly small. we personally 100% believe in vaccinations and our baby will start those when he hits two months in a few weeks. both of us have gotten flu shots and the tdap booster. we also talked to all of our childs grandparents about these and they all agreed that they would get them for the safety of our baby. my mil has never gotten a flu shot in her life, but when we told her about the severity of the flu and the risks for her grandbaby, she got it for the first time that day. the issue now lies with my sister in law and her family . my mil does not think sils three children are vaccinated. at all. they havent visited us yet, but we were planning on spending time together during the holidays. i honestly dont know how to handle this. i want to absolutely keep my baby away from any known antivax children until he is old enough to get vaccinated himself, but this is my fiancs only sibling and our childs only cousins. im even more concerned because the holidays are during the height of flu season. my sil is the most opinionated and stubborn person that i have ever met - trying to educate and change her mind isnt an option. as my mil isnt 100% sure, i plan on reaching out before the holidays and politely asking if her children have gotten their flu shots this year. however i am anticipating the answer to be no and want to be prepared, as i can be emotional and want to have a conversation and not a fight. does anybody else have close family that - to put it nicely and avoid an argument - have different lifestyle choices than you? how do i keep my newborn safe but not permanently damage a family relationship?	anxiousnewmama	/r/Mommit/comments/dob54n/newborn_preemie_antivax_sil_need_advice/	15	3	0	1.0	1572279831.0

i have no idea how to calm down and teach my 16 month old son	for months now my 16 month old has a meltdown for every single thing that does not go his way. whether hes hungry or he cant push a door open any further because of the hinges, etc. he wails out his crys, violently flails and ends up hurting himself/us, and purposefully screams at the top of his lungs in our faces if we try to talk to him. practically everyday is miserable except for the one day a week he decides things are okay. i prefer to let him try to work it out on his own within reach of him, and give him smiles when he pauses between outbursts. to me it feels like he would read that i am available but i only respond to calm words. mind you, once i do give him a hello and smile, he works himself up again. so i really never get the point across because eventually hes choking and red all over. usually the only thing that gets him to settle down is giving him food, no matter how recently he just ate . my boyfriend prefers to hold him the entire time and try to reason with him or he is firm for a couple minutes until he is annoyed with the crying and goes to our son to still get screamed at. i personally dislike him doing this because i feel like it reads to our son that any type of behavior is rewarded with attention, starting a cycle of overreacting to every tiny thing and never learning how to put yourself in check. there are occasions where he takes my approach but very rarely. i do not know the right method or approach to take. yes i know toddlers are emotionally unstable because theyre still learning what sad and mad are but he seems to be off the rails wild at all times. i am at such a loss and its making me severely dislike being around our son, please educate me on how i could improve or on methods that have worked for your children. any advice or constructive criticism is appreciated.	reenie612	/r/Mommit/comments/dozo8f/i_have_no_idea_how_to_calm_down_and_teach_my_16/	3	2	0	1.0	1572398078.0
help! how do i put my son to sleep?	please no judgement. i just need help! hes just never slept well. from about three months old to about seven months he woke up to 10 times per night. some nights he woke every 35 minutes all night long. i had to rock him back to sleep each time he woke up. during the day i had to rock him for 20-45 minutes to get him to nap for 35 minutes. then he hit a bad patch and just napped for 5-10 minutes each time. as you can imagine all the rocking was hard on me and i tore a muscle in my chest which was the last straw. i saw a sleep consultant and we taught him to self settle to sleep. we achieved that by patting and singing to him until he was nearly asleep in his cot and then slowly removing the patting and singing so he could go to sleep independently. it actually worked really well and he seemed to prefer going to sleep this way. things were looking up! we also were very strict with his awake hours during the day which resulted in him only waking 2-3 times a night. i would just feed him and put him down awake. he went back to sleep without issues. since then hes had a few of bad patches which lasted a couple of weeks. during that time we would pat him to sleep or hold him to sleep. basically it would be 50-60% of the time he self settled. over the months he dropped to 1-2 wakes during the night except for during the bad patches. now, he just turned one and everythings turned to crap. all the sudden hes fighting every single sleep. his awake periods are 3.5 hours but it was taking 40 minutes - 2 hours to get him to sleep. patting doesnt work, singing doesnt work, co sleeping doesnt work, rocking doesnt work, feeding doesnt work, changing the awake times makes things wayyyyyyyy worse . there is no way to get him to sleep except letting him cry. sometimes i stay with him and sing, sometimes i just reassure him but both just make it worse. doing this is killing me and there has to be a better way. im just out of options and i cant handle hearing him cry every single nap and every single night. please please help me find a better solution. i need mum advice!	throwawaysleepywife	/r/Mommit/comments/dp5g18/help_how_do_i_put_my_son_to_sleep/	2	2	0	1.0	1572435078.0

everyone told me it was teething! a year later we finally figured it out. why our lo wouldn't sleep through the night!	if your intuition is telling you something isn't right it probably isn't. no matter who i saw everyone thought she was just teething but how she would just wake up all through the night screaming at the top of her lungs for hours just did not seem normal. i could not console her in any way and was feeling like a complete failure as a mother. one morning she woke up and her breath reeked of rotten fish. finally the doctor she must have severe acid reflux and that first night on her medication she literally slept like a baby! i suffered for over a year trying to help her and no one believed me. mamas acid reflux can happen in babies of all ages and can make them extremely uncomfortable! hopefully this post can help a mama get a better nights sleep sooner!	milesandmaeyyc	/r/Mommit/comments/dtzvvu/everyone_told_me_it_was_teething_a_year_later_we/	47	426	0	0.99	1573324980.0

easier to fly when dying than pregnant with qatar airways	has anyone else had problems when flying pregnant? as a first-time mum-to-be, is it just me or do companies treat expectant mother's like they have a disease?? i've spent the last 6 weeks being shuffled from one qatar airways service desk to another because qatar's flying requirements are making it impossible for me to fly when 28 weeks pregnant . it would be easier for me to fly after having major surgery or stroke than when pregnant - and they'd probably give me special service and quick access rather than interrogate me when boarding! my husband and i have been away from home for 6 years, and booked one-way tickets from sweden to australia for december 2019. 2 weeks after we bought our tickets , we found out that we are expecting our first born . i will be 28 weeks when we are due to fly. qatar requires that i have their medical certificate signed, but no medical professional in sweden is willing to sign this document as it states 'person x is fit to travel for the time covering the entire journey with no intended/voluntary stopover at the transit point with qatar airways'. due to liability reasons, no medical professional is willing to guarantee that i am 'fit to fly' because they can't know what will happen in the future. and if providing my own medical certificate, the qatar website states that the certificate needs to have the following statement confirmation that patient is fit to travel for the entire journey, including return . qatar's requirements are literally making it impossible for me to fly home, and they've now stopped responding to my emails! isn't this discrimination against a healthy pregnant person??? i have no problem moving my flight earlier, but since we booked almost 6 months ago, to move our flights would cost us an extra 1000 usd each - which is not money we can throw around when expecting a newborn! how are companies allowed to discriminate against pregnant women but happily take unhealthy passengers that have greater risks?!

how to cut down the bed time routine?	my 3 year old son takes forever to go to sleep, from the time i say its time to get ready to bed till the time he actually goes to sleep, its been an hour and a half or more. heres our routine bath pajamas say good night to daddy and baby sister read a book while he has a snack read a book while brushing teeth read a book in bed with lights out and flashlight and music/timed light projector now its time to actually sleep and for him to start asking thingsi have to pee, wheres my bunny, tell me a story, comments/questions on things he hears downstairs-if all that fails, sometimes he will flat out refuse to lay down, other times he gives up when i tell him he goes to sleep with me now or by himself later unfortunately he sleeps in our bedroom most the time, but that is another battle to fight on another day..for now id just like any suggestions on how to not make the bedtime routine take so long! thanks!!!

how can i support my sil with her infertility struggles?	one of my family members is severely struggling mentally with her infertility. i cant speak on all of her medical issues because i never remember the details, but shes been trying for about 3-4 years and shes so depressed. she posts things on social media a few times a month now how shes really struggling. shes a strong christian, but even my two children bring her pain. possibly knowing she may never have this. i can sympathize with the grief, however, i cant relate. i know that my one, early miscarriage doesnt compare. im not saying shes not allowed to grieve or be depressed. i just feel almost helpless that my words will never be enough to make her heart lighter. and i dont want her to distance herself from my family forever because of what shes going through. i enjoy her company and the kids love her. shes also a godparent to them. i know my desires may sound selfish, but its just a reaction to how her depression not only affects her. it affects everyone else around her. so, is there anything i can do or say that will respect the space she wants while showing that i respect her grief?

need advice newborn feeding schedule/too much sleep?	i'm a new mom to a 5 day old baby girl. she is doing very well, healthy and happy. she had her first doc appt and is only 200grams away from being back at her birth weight. she is soiling lots of diapers, more than what the hospital said is required. anyway, i am needing some advice in terms of how often i should be feeding her. my milk came in yesterday and breastfeeding seems to be going well aside from some sore nipples. in 24hrs she is eating 7 or 8 times. the issue i'm having is that she can go a long stretch of time without eating. the hospital and my doctor were adamant that she needs to eat every 3 hrs, but she can sometimes go 5 or even 6 hrs. then she'll eat a lot in a short period of time. they said this was not good and i need to wake her up to eat. so, today i woke her up since it had been 3.5 hrs. she screamed bloody murder while i tried to get her to eat, calm down, try to eat again, etc. i calmed her down and then she just went back to sleep. at this point, it's almost 6hrs since her last meal. i don't know what to do. i feel like it's not a huge issue...i should let her sleep when she wants and she'll tell me when shes hungry, but i've got all this medical advice saying it's wrong. it's causing me a lot of stress. any thoughts/tips?	stopthistrain87	/r/Mommit/comments/e75rua/need_advice_newborn_feeding_scheduletoo_much_sleep/	12	6	0	0.76	1575671964.0

planning our family. advice, please	my husband and i want to start a family. i work full time and my husband is getting his phd in chemistry and works ~60 hr/week on that. he has 3 years left. we think we want kids, but i am the youngest so i don't really know what the day-to-day is like raising a child. he has 2 younger brothers and talks about how hard it is. we have 2 dogs who are a lot of work and dirty because they constantly go in and out through the dog door. we do our best to keep the house clean, but sometimes we just struggle to keep up. i want a baby and to be a mother, but i hear a lot of super hard things about being a parent and my husband doesn't have a ton of time as he works 60 hrs/week. we want to get pregnant late next year, but i recently have read some people regretting having kids. and the strain otheir relationship. we have a great relationship and he's my best friend, but we can get heated when we are discussing things we disagree on. i don't want to get into something i can t handle and i certainly don't want to risk my relationship, but i also wonder if the people who regret it didn't want kids in the first place. if anyone just have some words about the good and the bad, how you balence life, your solutions so some of the things you have overcome, i think it would help ease my mind. thank you all for your open and honest insight into parenthood.	chanpat	/r/Mommit/comments/e7zlzu/planning_our_family_advice_please/	13	5	0	0.78	1575839766.0
advice on hitting??	hey mommas. im looking on some advice on how to stop a young toddler from hitting. my son is almost 22 months old and hits a lot. out of excitement, frustration, sometimes even boredom? hell smack my face and then give me a kiss right after. frustrating. its been happening a lot lately. he also throws toys at me and my dog. i think ive managed to stop him from throwing things at the dog now but the other day he bruised my skull by whipping thomas the train at me and i had to put him in a different room for a while to collect myself because i was bleeding and nearly concussed. ive looked up advice but all the suggestions for toddlers arent really appropriate for my son. his communication skills arent strong enough for saying nearly anything to be helpful to him. im looking for something i can do that is more age-appropriate. if anyone has suggestions or links, id greatly appreciate it!

comfort nursing weaning advice?	background my little guy will be 4 months on christmas, and ive had my partner home for the last month, which has been more distracting than helpful. so admittedly, ive been getting a little off track as far as observing his patterns and responding to early cues. so when hes ready to sleep, sometimes ill be in the middle of cooking dinner etc, and by the time i get to put him down he is frustrated. reading, walking, rocking, and singing only work for a little while, and i still have a pissed off little person who isnt falling asleep. so ill give him the breast even when hes not hungry. and it works. and i feel guilty for creating this pattern. ideally, i will be more observant, and go thru the motions of the lay down routine earlier. but does anyone have any advice to halt this being too much of a crutch? stressin..	fweekowt	/r/Mommit/comments/eatszs/comfort_nursing_weaning_advice/	2	3	0	1.0	1576380452.0
just a mom who needs to vent and cry; struggling with my husband going out without me	this will be long. advice or encouragement is welcome. backstory husband and i have been together 10 years we used to do everything together. we were drinking buddies. there was no where i couldnt go. now we have a 1 year old and im expecting our second in march. and honestly im struggling... we moved out of state away from family. my mom is the only one near us now. i became a full time stay at home mom after working all my life. i really dont have friends and with his new job hes made a ton of friends. i get mad when he goes out without them and i cant go because i have our daughter. i get jealous that he gets adult interaction everyday and im dealing with a toddler. its like something in me just snaps and i become this demon wife yelling at him for going out! last night we went to a house christmas party with his co-workers, it was a kid friendly environment so we took our 1 year old to play with the hosts 1 year old. so that was nice. me and my child left early and my husband said he wouldnt be long behind us. well 2 hours passes and i find out hes went to a bar around the corner with some guys. and i just got sooooo angry. i felt like we spent hours with them already tonight, and he sees them almost everyday at work, why couldnt he just have come home?! and he didnt even mention they had left the party so i was also mad about that. he says he shouldnt have to get my permission to go out but i wasnt looking to give permission. i was staying awake to spend time with him when he came home but now it was late and our kid doesnt sleep through the night yet so i needed to get some sleep while i could... i just wanted to see him. anyways, we got into a huge fight when he got home and ended up going to bed mad at each other, which i dont think weve ever done. im so upset this morning. he says this pregnancy has changed me and yes i agree im so irrational and irritable this time around. im almost never in a good mood and he says im negative. im soooo lost, hurt, confused, i dont know whose in the right or wrong. on another note, i havent felt as connected to this pregnancy as i was with my first. honestly some days i dont even want to be pregnant. i dont want to go through labor. i dont want to go through the newborn phase again. im scared that deep down i dont want to have this second child and that is sooooooo depressing. im so lost right now. i dont even know where this post is going anymore. i really just needed to let this out. thanks for listening.	peonylove1031	/r/Mommit/comments/eazku6/just_a_mom_who_needs_to_vent_and_cry_struggling/	12	18	0	0.92	1576420346.0

need advice wife doesnt think she'll be a good mom for a girl	we just found out yesterday that we will be having a little girl. we are both very excited about our new addition, and i was confident from the get go that it would be a girl. when we got the results that it was a girl, i was pumped, but my wife was not as enthused. we started running through some girl names, but then she got quiet. as we were talking before bed, she says that she doesnt know if she'll be a good mom to a girl. she's not really a girlie girl , but is far from a tomboy and gave some stuff along those lines as reasons why. i was shocked and didnt really know what to say. my wife is an attorney and one of the hardest working, determined, strong minded people i have ever met in my life. she's athletic and competitive. shes funny and sweet and cares for me and our 2 fur babies more than i could have ever dreamed of. how can i reassure her that she is the perfect role model and i hope that our girl has her fire and drive? i dont want to say the wrong things and i want to reassure her that she will be fantastic as a girl mom. any help would be appreciated. tl;dr - wife doesnt think she'll be a good girl mom. need help reassuring her.	car0lina_pines	/r/Mommit/comments/ecdth1/need_advice_wife_doesnt_think_shell_be_a_good_mom/	26	39	0	0.93	1576681761.0

at the end of my rope and i don't know what to do.	tl;dr my 4 year old has been progressively getting more and more aggressive towards others. about a year and a half ago we had to switch daycares because they threatened to kick him out for aggression, being a bully and hitting his friends. . since he started the new daycare hes been doing really well. hes been making friends and the teachers love him. in the past couple of months weve been getting reports every now and then that hell hit a friend or push a friend. well talk to him, and it doesnt seem to happen again for a few weeks. last week we got a report that he choked a friend. we talked to him and discussed why this was wrong. then he got in trouble for hitting the teacher. once again we sat him down and talked to him. today i got a report that he bit a friend. i guess they were having milk and cookies and he was bothering his friend, she told him to stop, so he bit her on the shoulder. from what i understand it wasnt hard, and it didnt leave a mark. we are currently in the process of arranging a meeting with his teacher and the daycare director to discuss what to do when he has the moments. as for his homelife, there hasnt been any major changes. he has a little sister that he is nothing but sweet to. when she takes his toys, yes he cries, but he doesnt hit her, or push her. he comes and gets either me or his father to help. my husband and i dont argue in front of them, we dont hit, or push. we sometimes raise our voices when he wont listen to us. my husband likes to play videogames, some of them have been too violent. so he has restricted his game time to when our son is asleep. we were letting him watch some shows that were probably too advanced for him which we have since taken away. we restrict his tv time to maybe a movie on saturday or sunday. when we sit him down to have discussions with him about his behavior, theres this weird shift in his eyes. i dont know how to describe it, but its like his eyes go from bright and alive, to dull and dead. its probably the most frustrating thing. weve taken away privileges, toys, activities, and nothing seems to get through to him. when he gets angry at us for saying no, he screams and throws fits. lately weve tried elf on the shelf and the whole santa is watching, but it doesnt seem to make a difference. my husband doesnt want to take him to a therapist because hes afraid they are just going to put him on medication he doesnt need. i just dont know what to do anymore. any advice welcome! thank you for reading, and sorry for the rambling.	katekim717	/r/Mommit/comments/ecy9zg/at_the_almost_end_of_my_rope_and_i_dont_know_what/	9	4	0	1.0	1576784696.0
how do you do christmas presents from your child?	my son is 4 and super excited to pick out a present for his dad, so we are going shopping this afternoon. last year he wanted to get ice cream and i talked him into finding a nice coffee mug since daddy's favourite had just broken. this year, i'm inclined to let him buy what he wants so long as it won't spoil under the tree. he is currently convinced that daddy needs a monster truck so they can play monster trucks together and daddy will have one all his own. my husband can be hard to buy for, so i don't really have a better idea and i know he will love anything our son picks out but i also don't want to teach ds to buy things for others with just his own wants in mind. he is convinced that since he gets toys, we should get toys too and doesn't want to buy boring gifts. i want him to think about what would make the other person really happy, even if it's not something he really likes. i'm pretty torn, since it is adorable that he wants us to have toys too. how do you help your kids buy presents for adults? what interesting ideas have your kids come up with?

nervous for birth because of past trauma, ftm and need advice please!	hi everyone. im new to reddit, so i dont exactly know how the website works yet, so pls forgive me if i goof up on anything. im currently 25 weeks and 5 days pregnant with my first baby. she was honestly a surprise but were super excited for her. ive always wanted a family and my fianc and i are thrilled that we were blessed with her. im very nervous for her birth because of sexual trauma i endured when i was younger . i have ptsd from it and have a lot of repressed memories. im really nervous that birth is going to be triggering for me because of my abuse instead of something positive. because of an immune disorder i have, it is common for women with this disorder to have a planned c-section because we can produce bigger babies and it can be dangerous for both mom and baby. i really dont want to have a c-section if i dont have to. because of the immune disease i have, having a c-section gives my baby a higher chance of developing the same crappy immune condition, and i would hate to say i didnt even try vaginally before going in for a c-section if needed. so that leaves me in a really tough spot, because im nervous to deliver vaginally and have it be traumatic for me ptsd-wise, but if i have a c-section instead, i will forever blame myself if i didnt try vaginally and she ends up eventually getting the same immune condition as me. i really need advice, coping skills, or hopefully even birth stories from fellow abuse survivors. im really nervous and my therapist is great and has two kids of his own, but he said because hes a man he cant totally understand where i am coming from but will try his best to help me prepare.	alas_its_cass	/r/Mommit/comments/eeikb8/nervous_for_birth_because_of_past_trauma_ftm_and/	7	3	0	1.0	1577094287.0

need advice to curb 4 year old's haggling and whining/brooding.	i have a very well spoken and mature 4 year old , misunderstood , or really wants to do something, out comes the crocodile tears. i've tried the whole, i can't hear you when you're whining thing but it's been a spectacular failure. either she'll end up more frustrated, ignore what i said and continue to whine or argue that she's not whining but actually crying. we've also tried taking space and yoga breaths. these only seem to exasperate the issue. i'm not sure if i'm not doing it correctly. in the same vein, if something has gone wrong, she won't use her words to tell people what's happened, but mope/pout until someone notices then cries about it. for example, at school , if they are serving a snack that she doesn't like, she'll look at her plate and not touch it, become quiet until the teacher asks her about it then she'll cry. it all could have been headed off by her telling the teacher that she doesn't want blueberries. the next issue is the arguing. i want her to do something and sometimes, there's no question... just do it. i think of this particularly if we're walking in a busy street, if something unexpected happens, i want her to do what i ask because there may not be time to explain why she needs to do it. but i just wanna-, i need to do this first-, i'm not finished with-. i don't really care! i want her to do it the first time i ask with no bargaining or fuss. what's lion tamer/tightrope walker/mom on stilts to do? 	billiepw	/r/Mommit/comments/ef6tu4/need_advice_to_curb_4_year_olds_haggling_and/	5	5	0	1.0	1577220239.0

what do you look for in a mom's group? is disallowing fathers as the primary member a benefit or red flag?	their meetup group says >we welcome any mother who has the time and desire to attend an active playgroup... currently, we do not accept fathers or caregivers to the group as the primary member. we are for mom's of little ones only! ... at this time, dads, nannies, grandparents, etc cannot bring little ones to play dates in place of moms not designated as family events. the group was formed to allow moms an opportunity to develop a social network while providing social interaction for their child . like, i don't know if this sounds like a good thing to have a place for moms to get support or a bad thing as it sounds pretty uptight. i mean it's probably a moot point anyway since i'm a trans woman mom and we're in the center of the rust belt/trump country but it looks like they might be the only moms group within an hour and a half of me and i really want to make some friends.

where is the compassion?!	i need to vent so hard right now. what is it about women who have had children years ago, that they seem to have forgotten how hard some moments can be, and they absolutely lack compassion for others? i posted on fb about our long night last night... i have a preemie who now has reflux, and every comically bad thing that could happen last night, did. we changed clothes four times, peed all over himself and myself because in my exhaustion, it took me way too long to get his fresh diaper on. gas and spitting and peeing out of diapers, feeding every three hours and holding for an hour after in order to try to keep it all down. i literally posted two cute pics and said that a spitty baby = zero sleep, but the little booger is so worth it, and i know he won't be little for long. first comment, bam... 60+ year old mom whose youngest is over 20...admonishing me to cherish the moments when he needs you, because nothing is nothing like them. ok, but one of the pics is ne, exhausted, holding my baby at 3 am, smiling. i am cherishing. how can you have so little compassion for your sisters? where did this culture come from? not to mention you've seen my struggle since he was born at 34 weeks, spent nearly a month in the nicu, while i was also in the icu. we stayed at ronald mcdonald, i came home half dead and with a preemie. how can people see that struggle and not just be kind and compassionate? an i literally only ever allowed to be eternally grateful, no matter how hard things are in the moment? it's not even about facebook... this woman knows me in my life very well and it wasn't just some random friend but i see the behavior from so many women, i just don't get it. someone help me down off this soap box, cause i need to lie down 	stormy_llewellyn	/r/Mommit/comments/ehloiw/where_is_the_compassion/	43	155	0	0.91	1577710261.0

i want to hear your stories about bf weaning!	i want to hear your stories but also wanted to share mine about why i need to wean i have a 14 month old who absolutely loves the boob. once she sees it she makes the most excited noises that she never makes for anything else. shes so sweet and i love the bonding, but it has made some things difficult for us. she has always had a hard time taking to the bottle, and has never been enthusiastic about drinking bm from a bottle, formula, cows milk, or anything from a cup or sippy cup . one small victory ive had is being able to feed her bottles when we are out of the house. she seems to understand that she doesnt get the boob when we are not at home. however, this also means she absolutely refuses the bottle when we are at home, no matter how hungry she gets. of course my supply has been tanking and i produce only 3-4oz each day at most, so i know shes not getting the nutrients she needs, and probably only gets 1-2oz after sucking on the boob for 20 mins. she has lost a bit of weight about 19-20lbs, by our bathroom scale. i think some days shes only getting 8-10oz of milk total, when kids her age should be getting 20ish. she eats solids ok, but still seems hungry a lot of the time. the other day she told me she wanted the boob by crying and pointing at the nursing chair. i think this thing has gotta go, but our apt is so small we have no other place for it and i cant afford to keep throwing out expensive pieces of furniture! in any case, i think we really need to stop, mostly so that she can get proper nutrients, and also so i can have time to do other things. shes with grandma for the next week, so i will use this time to figure how my strategy... anyway i want to hear your stories about how you weaned or what your plan is as encouragement! is your baby clingy like mine or did they self wean? at what age? also, should i post this to r/breastfeeding? i thought most people there would still be bfing and not having weaned, idk...	momnesiac	/r/Mommit/comments/ei5ke9/i_want_to_hear_your_stories_about_bf_weaning/	72	40	0	0.93	1577811957.0

need some advice/encouragement	hey everyone, i posted this on r/pregnant but i fee like it would help to hear from people on here too. so i just found out that im pregnant again. our daughter is only 11 months old and im freaking pregnant again. this time it was a complete accident, husband and i were both drunk and it just happened before he realized it. i took the morning after pill the next day and, with a 95% chance of success, i still ended up pregnant. obviously, im not too thrilled about it. i feel like our daughter is still so little and needs so much attention, financially we are nowhere near ready for another child, im just so scared and disappointed. i didnt want our second child to happen like this. i also feel really guilty because we just got back from our honeymoon and, assuming that the pill worked like it was supposed to, i drank a lot and rode a lot of rollercoasters. i know those things typically dont have much of an effect on the fetus this early on, but still. im only 3-4 weeks along and im already anemic again and having morning sickness, which i didnt have with our first, so i really dont feel good. i feel guilty not playing with our daughter as much as normal but every time i stand up or really even move i either almost throw up or pass out. i dont feel like im ready to go through pregnancy again, i was enjoying being able to be myself again and having my body back. if there are any other second time moms out there, i would really like to hear how you all did it. i just feel so guilty and terrified and just dont know how to handle all this right now. thankfully my husband is very supportive, positive, and actually really excited about the new addition, but i just feel like it would help me to hear from another mom who may have went through the same or a similar situation. thank you!

advice how to tell a parent to look after their child?	hi mommit! im a new mum and im looking for advice on how to deal with other parents. i dont want to come across as a karen of too aggressive and i definitely dont want to be offensive. basically ayla, a 3yo member of extended family and j have been acting inappropriately when visiting. their behaviour includes - hitting, harassing, chasing and throwing things at my pets. - hitting each other and guests - roughly playing with my infants toys, to the extent that it seems they are will fully attempting to break them - going into the nursery after being told not to because the baby is sleeping, and waking the baby. steps ive taken to correct the behaviour - developed kid zones such as the outdoor play area , deck area and lounge - firmly told them no when they behave inappropriately - told js mother when he is behaving wrongly and asking her to intervene. - separately the dogs its not working. aylas parents are super hands off and do little to no supervision of their child at events . js dad isnt in the picture but his mum, aunts and grandmother are pretty good with keeping an eye on him most of the time. the kids refused to listen to me though and kept abusing my dogs. even when i locked the dogs up they let them out and kept being bratty. how do i politely tell the parents to supervise their own kids? its hard for me to stop the kids getting into the nursery and waking my baby and breaking his toys, while also looking after other guests while also stopping these kids from assaulting my pets. i kind of feel like aylas parents, in particular, treat us as free day care. my primary concern is the wellbeing of my pets and my child - both of which are suffering due to the negligence of these other parents. but im also worried ayla and j could get hurt if they push my pets too far. sorry for the rant, im pretty emotional right now and wound up after all this went down yesterday. im honestly considering never hosting another damn event because i cant not invite these family members but i also cant take the stress. please help	Goddess182	/r/Mommit/comments/eqmq0c/advice_how_to_tell_a_parent_to_look_after_their/	24	29	0	0.97	1579383285.0

advice on children meeting dads new partner	firstly i'm on my phone, so sorry if formatting is incorrect. wasn't really sure where else to post, so again sorry if not the right forum. me and my children's dad broke up around a year ago now. the relationship wasn't really very good and has left me with terrible anxiety and even lower self worth. now he has a new partner, which 2 weeks before announcing he was with he had been constantly texting me how much he loved me and wanted to prove it to me. i didn't believe him but i was still hurt that he then got with someone 2 weeks after the fact. now, they've been together a couple of months now and i appreciate the fact they are going to meet new partners at some point. they met her for the first time last weekend and this weekend just gone, being his weekend to have them, she was there all weekend. they didn't go anywhere, all stayed in the house and played games, like hide and seek. it's incredibly difficult for me, that they are playing family with my kids 	Franr1991	/r/Mommit/comments/erb2gy/advice_on_children_meeting_dads_new_partner/	6	4	0	0.84	1579512689.0
what was it like transitioning into a stay at home mom?	so i did it..i put in my two weeks notice at work so that i can be a stay at home mama to our 6 month old son. but im worried for my sanity. he has been attending daycare ever since my maternity leave ended when he was only 8 weeks old so that my husband and i can both work full time. he is constantly getting sick from daycare so ive been missing a lot of work due to having to be home with him or taking him to the doctor. and unfortunately there is no part time option for my specific job so i officially put in my two weeks notice 3 days ago. im excited, nervous, and terrified all at once. im anxious for the transition. for the past 14 years ive never not had a job. ever since i was 15 in high school ive had my own job because ive had to pay for my own things. my husband is wonderful and driven and hopefully will have no problem supporting us. but the thought of not making my own money really has me worried. the thought of being home all day every day is giving me anxiety. of course im so happy that i get to spend this special time with our son but im a pretty social person and i enjoy working and talking to people and getting out of the house. i also love my job and ive been here for about 4 years and have worked my way up in the company. i considered it my career. they say there will always be a spot for me if i ever decide to come back but im still sad to be leaving. i guess im just looking for advice from other stay at home mamas. is there anything that made the transition easier for you? what kinds of activities do you do at home with your little ones? where do you take them when you wanna get out of the house? is there anything you do to make some extra cash from home? and how do you keep from going crazy? im excited for this endeavor but slightly terrified at the same time so hopefully some of you mamas can lend some advice to a nervous first time mom?	tstein26	/r/Mommit/comments/eribqu/what_was_it_like_transitioning_into_a_stay_at/	6	5	0	0.86	1579549062.0
i need help with a hard child.	i have a hard kid who is turning 10. he is incredibly intelligent but hates school and acts out everytime he goes. i have started a podcast because i don't have a lot of people that i feel i can ask. he is classic adhd. he hates sitting still and he loves dark movies and video games and art so it makes him stand out in a bad way at school. he is so anxious all the time and so unpredictable emotionally. he is aggressive then super remorseful and then attacks himself about how he wants to be good but can't. i have taken him to therapy, i have covered the poor dude in lavender, i have gotten up early and taken him to playgrounds before school, we have tried medicine, meditation, and god knows what else and i am just so lost. he is a beautiful person and cares so deeply which makes him fragile. i did a podcast episode if you want the link to hear it because i ramble on a bit about him and i suck at writing. but i desperately want advice on how you have delt with those wonderful wild children that can not fit into the school system. how do you help them socially? what did you do wrong? what would you have done differently?	blowonmybootiehole	/r/Mommit/comments/eshufg/i_need_help_with_a_hard_child/	9	4	0	0.75	1579725688.0
when good intentions fail	oof... today was rough. i learned a lot, quickly, about things not to do at my job, although my intentions came from a caring place. trying to focus on the learning part, and what i would say to others if they told me about a day like the one i had. i was worried i wouldnt be able to shake it when i walked through my door, but that sweet boy of mine made it all melt away. now that hes sleeping im again working on re-framing the days events... this week has piled on, birthday party planning, getting stuff together for another round of ivf, still getting my feet under me at a new job, my almost 2 year old not wanting bed time stories or songs, and waking almost daily before 5 am. this will pass, i will get to the other side, just to continue learning and applying what ive learned so far, but im tired.

single mom struggling to keep it together. vancouver	i don't want to be a pity story here. i just want some advice is all. i currently unemployed because the area im living in has basically no fulltime childcare or even reliable support. i have an older child, his father was abusive and moved to another province. my family are super abusive so i had to cut ties with them haven't been in contact with really any of them in years. i don't really have a lot of friends my age with a child i'm 27 years old with an 8 year old or really any reliable friends at all . my land lord is a massive pervert, sexually harassed me multiple times spies on me and gossips about me upstairs and has entered my suite and steals my mail, i've been living in the place for past almost 4 years, last time i had a job was over a year ago, and i could only get night shifts and that's when i had my good friend who could baby but realistically that wasn't long term. i am trying to house search past 3-4 months. which what i have been doing but housing here is in high demand but low supply. applied to subsidized housing. i do want full-time work but i have no one to watch my child when i have no one to watch him when he's off school. i live in vancouver,bc. if there's anything i can do to improve my situation at all besides moving. any you have or know about. resources would be appreciated. i look for housing almost 2-3 times a day off craiglist and i have been speaking to land lords on an everyday basis. no luck because i don't want to move back into another place with a slumlord who wants to dictate how i live or what i do inside or outside my place. i am a great tenant pay rent on time and i am very silent, and i keep the place almost spotless, i don't party or do drugs, all the friends that come by smoke down the street away from the property. or even a reliable baby sitter site or place to apply for extra support to check out for when my child is out of school, extra housing resources would be appreciated. i already applied to bc housing and the wait list is insanely long. any other places i could house search through or even places to apply for baby sitting part time so i can get back on my feet and be a lot more stable would be amazing. or even a friend to talk would be nice or even some support groups on here. i feel extremely isolated and lonely and depressed. i also forgot to mentioned my neighbours are drug addicts and party animals have started fights with me multiple times. i have nobody else to turn too, i have stressed out as much as i could i got support workers, but nothing. sorry for my terrible grammar and lack of punctuation. just upset and stressed out, any support and resources would be amazing and greatly appreciated, thank you for reading my rant and giant paragraphs.	strugglingperson1923	/r/Mommit/comments/f0orb3/single_mom_struggling_to_keep_it_together/	8	6	0	1.0	1581149500.0

how did you get your big babies to sleep?!	my 8 month old is really the size of a 15 month old. hes 25 pounds and over 30 inches. we had to stop using a swaddle at 3 months because we couldnt find a big enough one, swaddled with a blanket for a while and then transitioned to a sleep sack which just didnt work for us. . we got a hand me down magic sleep suit when he was 6 months, size large and he was busting out already. now im at a loss, i put him down drowsy, he falls asleep. step one, check. dark room, check. white noise, check. then i think he gets to a light part of his sleep cycle and not being held wakes him up. hes standing up crying at his crib and lying him down and singing to him/ rubbing his back is a bust at this point. as soon as i pick him up though hes back to being knocked out. but if i dare put him down hes right back up. now im at the point were im up with him rocking him back into rem 2-3 times a night. im at a loss. should we go back to swaddling with a blanket? i was under the impression that swaddling a mobile baby is dangerous. please mummas, grant me your wisdom!	n0ts0dainty	/r/Mommit/comments/f1h7t1/how_did_you_get_your_big_babies_to_sleep/	22	3	0	0.81	1581291025.0

how do i raise a daughter to speak up for herself?	i have a very sweet, bright, well spoken 3.5 year old. yesterday we went to an event at the library which was not well attended during which one of the other kids was trying to play with my kid who was not interested. first off i do my best not to be a helicopter parent. my kid will grow up and have to navigate the world herself and while she is little i'm right here watching and available to step in, but i do believe she needs the freedom to figure stuff out for herself for when im not there in the future. that said, actively stopping myself from helicoptering felt so awkward yesterday and i don't know if i should have stepped in. the other child who wanted to play with my daughter was a little boy about 6 years old and twice the size of my daughter who is petite. he was polite and sweet and obviously just a kid excited to be there and who wanted to include her and play. but he would try to move her to the play area by grabbing her hand or touching her shoulder. my daughter's body language was very clearly not wanting to go and he wasnt picking up on that. i watched and when it was clear my daughter wasn't going to say anything i would ask her if she wanted to play and ask what she wanted to do. she would say she wanted to sit with me. so we did and yet the boy persisted. this kept up for another 5 minutes or so with him bringing toys or suggesting other areas to play in. she would start deciding to play and then he would join in and she would kind of freeze. i would watch and if he was pulling her too much i stepped in, but now i wonder if i should have intervened differently or earlier. the kid was there with his grandfather who was present but not really intervening or seeing an issue. i just felt like i was struggling in what to do. i didn't want to overstep by parenting the boy and wanted to give my daughter the freedom to say what she wanted in an environment where there was no real danger. but she was clearly feeling uncomfortable saying or doing anything. should i have been more vocal to the kid teaching him not to touch people without asking? and telling him she didn't want to play? is it reasonable to expect my 3.5 year old to tell him that? we've been reading and discussing body boundaries at home so she knows she can say no and if she has trouble to go to an adult but she didnt do either of those things. how do i encourage her without helicoptering?

i don't know how i feel about my mil	hello mommits, sorry it's gonna be a long post. so, my husband and i are quite the young couple, we were long distance for almost a year and decided to move in together. a month before moving in, i met his parents, i found his mother to be opinionated and sometimes annoying, very critical and not really caring about other people's feeling. i found out i was pregnant just two weeks after moving in and we announced it the third time i saw her. she was a bit stunned but quite happy. she works in a maternity ward and told me i could ask any question i had but she wouldn't meddle if i didn't ask which i find quite nice of her. and i did take her up on her offer, esp for breastfeeding cause she has a lactation consultant diploma. i make sure to send her frquent pictures of the baby, it's her first grandchild and she loves him so much. a few weeks ago, we were invited to help my bil to move, i felt it wasn't good for the baby but my husband insisted, saying his family would be happy to see the baby. when we called his mother, she was horrified at the thought of the baby being there and made me feel like a bad mom, when i originally didn't want to go. they came by after the move and we had a nice meal so i felt i was just oversensitive. we continued texting, mostly me sending pictures of the baby and her reacting to him being so cute. comes today, we were invited to lunch at their place. a few days ago, my mil told my husband she had a health scare and narrated her whole scare , almost making him cry cause he started believing she was announcing she had breastcancer. when she started talking about it, i jokingly said she almost made him cry because she didn't start by saying it was nothing. she replied that she wasn't one to lie to her children and how would i have wanted him to react and started to rant on how the doctor she saw was incompetent and she has to get more test done.. idk, i mean if i were to announce sthg like that i'd have started by telling my children to not worry as it is benine and then i would describe the process. still, all day she kept going back on her scare and saying over and over that she always told her children the truth. then she commented about our son sleeping in his father's arms and then about the fact that he would be quite energetic after his bottles and as he moves a lot, he sometimes regurgitates. i kinda felt attacked about how i am raising my child, and also bothered by the fact she kept going back to her health scare . so, mommits am i oversensitive ? i mean i only get two days a week where i can see my child, so spending one of them feeling judged quite bothers me. i don't know what to think cause i had come to the conclusion that my first feeling about her was not reprsentative and today i felt as i did that first day.

why is my child not napping/sleep deprived ask for advice.	ok so relevant info im a full time student/sahm and have been a sahm since my son was born. he will be 2 at the end of march. we have a routine as far as sleep and naps go but as im sure yall know, sometimes that varies by an hour or two depending on what life throws at me that day but for the most part were on time. besides the regressions which hes always been on time for, hes always been a great sleeper. goes to bed about 9-9 30pm and would wake up anywhere from 9 30-10 30am, naps are usually around 1 but can vary slightly depending on when he wakes up, and he typically will nap, like 5-6 hour naps. seemingly overnight this has all gone out the window. he takes forever to go down for naps and when he does its maybe an hour or two, tops. which is unfortunate bc that is also my nap time lol. at night hes also taking forever to go down and has been waking up quite a bit throughout the night way more then usual. typically if hed wake up at night wed just hear a cry bc hed realize his pacifier fell out and then hed find it and back to silence. i dont think he was truly even waking up at these moments. but lately hes definitely been actually waking up and weve had to go in and soothe him a few times. hes also been waking up way earlier then usual . all of this points to the sleep regression patterns weve seen in the past, and really thats all i can think of bc theres been no major life/schedule changes but when i try to google for tips everything is about the kid getting out of bed and having to put them back to bed and stuff involving a child that is in a big kid bed. ours is still in a crib although probably not far from figuring out how to hop out soooo just curious if yall have any tips/advice. even if its just telling me ive been there and sorry but its just gonna suck for a while is helpful lol	trippapotamus	/r/Mommit/comments/f8frcp/why_is_my_child_not_nappingsleep_deprived_ask_for/	4	0	0	0.5	1582491514.0
advice for hiring babysitters?	we are looking to hire our first 'stranger' babysitter for our 17 month old . we don't have family in town, but our day care has a 'date night' once every three months, so we have used that to get out of the house. however, we are looking to find someone that we feel comfortable calling on an as-needed basis to give us more frequent date nights now that our baby is a little older. i am nervous about this - do others have tips on how to approach this situation? we arranged a 'meet-and-greet' with someone reviewed on a child care website, but i'm of course thinking about worst-case scenarios of having a complete stranger in my home and taking care of my child. have any of you used baby monitors that you can access from your phone, so you can see that everything is ok while you're out? did you consider using security cameras in other areas of the house? any problems you've run into that i can learn from? any advice you have would be greatly appreciated!

how to get more time in the day for us	i saw that little comic yesterday about the baby finally sleeping for the night and instead of alone time your spouse wants time together. i seem to be having the opposite problem. i get plenty of alone time during the day during naps and just when baby is hanging out with toys but my husband works everyday from 6am to 5 pm. however at 6pm we start the night time routine so i am heavily baby focused until about 9/10 when she finally goes down for the night it almost feels like we are forcing each other to spend time together instead of just going to bed. not in a bad way either, we do want to spend time together but we are just so tired its hard to start any kind of game or show without half zoning out or falling asleep. weve been staying up until midnight just playing games together lately and its fun at night but in the morning when we get up we are both very tired and grouchy and then husband is gone all day. so im asking how to get more time together without sacrificing much needed sleep or if anyone knows how to add more than 24 hours to a day that would also be nice	omfglaurenpaige	/r/Mommit/comments/f9f4iq/how_to_get_more_time_in_the_day_for_us/	4	1	0	1.0	1582657016.0
sleep training suggestions etc	my baby is 6 months now. she started co sleeping with me at two months because she's breast fed and it just felt safer to side lay and feed. that way i could prop her for refux and i wouldn't fall asleep sitting up feeding her. now she's having a sleep regression and waking up trying to practice her new skills. crawling standing cruising being a literal monkey she's always fell asleep on the breast. sometimes you can sway or rock her to sleep. there is no tricking her by rocking and then laying her down. she wants me beside her. i can though sneak out of bed and place her fort around her . i don't mind all the snuggles and cuddles of sleeping together but she's become to active. it's not ideal anymore. i'm going to have to have her sleep in her play pen instead of crib. when i attempted good association with the crib she ended up getting caught in the bars and hitting her head on the sides. not to mention even in it's lowest setting she can pull up on the top bar and start pulling her body forward. did i say she's a monkey? i was wondering what modified version of sleep training i could do. i just don't feel like any particular method would work. doesn't help that i'm her pacifier and she's used to the big bed. she'll put herself back to bed sometimes if she reaches over and feels me . her personality just seems to strong for giving up. i'm lucky she'll fall asleep in her carseat now. she's really attached to me now and definitely has separation anxiety. i thought none of this was supposed to happen for a few months but like they say. every baby is different. she didn't recognize grandpa since they don't see eachother often. and i could tell she was looking at me to see if he was 'safe'. she'll smile at strangers but is no longer reaching for them or playful. just sweet but still wary. it almost feels like i just have to wait for her to do it herself in a way . since month 2 she's been super alert . she needs constant stimulation during the day. like i swear she gets bored every 15 minutes and needs a new place. unless she's trying to get into something she shouldn't like climbing up the side of the ottoman to see what 'toys' or chewable items she can find. she's also really sensitive. like clothes, texture, sounds.she even requires her feet to be elevated to sleep. she's had bad reflux since birth. never wanting to be on her back. though now she'll roll on her back with her head back and sometimes back arched to sleep comfortably. sitting up or elevated has never really helped much. but since she's growing fine the pediatrician isn't worried about the reflux. i can tell it bothers the sensitive little girl though. anyone ever have an experience like this? when laid down alone she just rolls over or sits up and starts crawling/or standing. a lot of downward dog. so this is why my plan involves the pack n play/playpen. crying isn't ever calmed by rubbing her back or just talking to her like these methods suggest. don't get me wrong she's not entirely stressful or anything. she's actually quite fun with how she is. she's very happy during the day. she just becomes a different beast when she's sleepy or having reflux come up in her mouth. i feel like she could fight for a week straight before she'd fall asleep on her own. i don't know if i'm describing this well or if it's to long. she's got a major sleep association with the breast. she's now going through a regression and will sleep crawl, roll, and stand which then wakes her up. and it's becoming hard to safely let her sleep with me and hard to even get her back to sleep. i can see with the cry it out method should would just flail around and over heat and choke from crying. i would like to hear from anyone that had/has ..... this kind of baby? she's the type that wants it her way. ex was trying to just do bottles when out in public but she'll refuse to eat from me unless it's boobs or delicious puree. if she knows i'm around she'd die before she took a bottle. i may just have to wait all this out. i hope this makes sense. _____ in short she'll only sleep on my breast 6 months old reflux cosleeps now waking up crawling/cruising headboard/standing very strong willed and not easily tricked easily distracted and adventurous sensitive to everything happy until sleepy time separation anxiety my pediatrician doesn't seem to understand at all. doesn't help that now when she cries she's repeats mama mama over and over	LunarMimi	/r/Mommit/comments/f9zl3k/sleep_training_suggestions_etc/	5	2	0	1.0	1582748691.0

my firstborn daughter is creeping ever closer to the age where she's gonna ask me about her biological dad in a much more grown up way	she'll be ten in april. she knows that my husband is not her biological father. we started dating when she was almost three and he legally adopted her last summer. it's not some secret. she remembers him showing up in her life and knows that he wasn't there when she was born. when she was a toddler, she asked all the time why she didn't have a dad. she hasn't asked me a question like that in almost seven years. but i feel like the day is inevitable when she asks me about her biological dad in a much more grown up way than a toddler wondering why she doesn't have a dad. she's going to ask from the perspective of someone who understands how babies are made. here's the real story i was 20 and a wild child. i would constantly drink and sometimes do cocaine/ecstasy and routinely hook up with random strangers. one night in the summer of 2009 i picked the first guy who agreed to come home with me at the bar, took him home, and about a month later was told by a doctor that i was pregnant. i know who the guy is. i told him i was pregnant with his child. and i never heard from him again after that. he ran. he has never met the child he fathered. i have no idea where he is today. i can't find any social media activity for him after the fall of 2012. for all i know he's been dead this whole time. i left the alcohol/drug crazed lifestyle in the past the minute i found out i was pregnant. now i'm in my early 30's and have developed a healthy relationship with responsibility and a much more genuine faith in god. i'm ashamed of a lot of the behavior that led up to it, but i don't regret it at all, because my daughter saved my life, and her birth set into motion the chain of events that led me to meeting my husband, the man of my dreams, who has since fathered my second daughter and adopted my first. my question is, for parents who have had to explain something like this to their kid how much detail did you go into? how old was your kid when they asked? i know it's coming some day.

6 month old mover = excessive spit up 	hey all! my six month old son has recently learned he can wiggle, roll, and almost crawl. so essentially he is always trying to get put down and get moving. even if i baby-wear him, he thrashes around and tries to get out. i'm excited to have such an eager little boy, and i know he's going to be a runner when he's a toddler, haha. my question is - have other mothers found it difficult to keep baby less mobile after eating? i try leaving him in his high chair to sit up for a while, and it helps, but as soon as he's back on the floor all that tummy activity eventually results in a lot of spit up. and because we're on some solids now, i can't imagine that it's comfortable for him. did you just treat it as a phase and clean up the extra spit up? did you find a way to keep them from moving for a while? is spit-up our life now? it should be noted it doesn't seem to be an allergy, and he didn't spit up a lot before so i am pretty convinced it's because of all the exercising he's up to! i'd love to hear your stories.	xxlcraig	/r/Mommit/comments/faxhm8/6_month_old_mover_excessive_spit_up_advice/	3	2	0	1.0	1582908170.0
where did the joy go?	i am a sahm of a nine year old girl and a four year old boy, when my daughter was born i was in my twenties and had all this energy, i took her to parks we went to the mall we went to meet my friends we were out and about most of the time, i was involved with her school, kept up on all the housework and chores found time to workout two hours a day and was pretty much the picture of a overachieving mother. when my son was born i was in my late twenties and when we was a baby i was the same just as involved with him and her, keeping up on my daily duties as well as finding time to workout albeit i cut down the time to thirty full minutes a day instead of two hours . somewhere around the time my son turned three everything started becoming much harder to manage, i am finding it harder to be happy doing all of these things. i used to love reading to my kids and playing with them and going places with them but now it all seems so forced, sometimes i feel like i am unfulfilled by my life and then i immediately feel guilty for feeling that way because i decided to be a sahm for them. i still take them places and do things with them, but i am not nearly as hands on as i was when they were both smaller. i feel my son suffers the most from this as he is still so little and honestly gets way too much screen time. has anyone else ever felt this way? how do i find the joy again in being a full time mother?	naturallythrownnaway	/r/Mommit/comments/fbekoh/where_did_the_joy_go/	2	6	0	0.88	1582992303.0

i just don't know how to process this	ever since my daughter was born two years ago my husband has been adamantly a one-and-done kind of guy. a few months ago he started mentioning the fact of maybe having another one and i jumped on that bandwagon. i got my iud removed and we started the trying but not trying game. this entire month i've been having really intense pregnancy symptoms. i'm talking super sore boobs, intense mood swings, nausea, you name it. i'm not due for my period for 4 more days but took a test today just in case. big fat negative. the whole time i've been having these symptoms my husband has been saying how scared he is and how he really wishes i wasn't pregnant. so now that it's negative he's super relieved and i can't help but be super depressed. i don't know how to process it because after my daughter was born i went into severe postpartum depression so i don't want to go down that road again. but i also want the opportunity to have a second child. we have the conversation of how are you feeling after the negative test and i opened up and said i was disappointed and he was like well i'm super relieved . i don't know what i'm hoping this gets. i just needed to vent. like how could he be for a second and then flip a switch?! i just don't get it. and i don't get my emotions right now. i had been ok with one. now i'm sad i'm not pregnant?? being a woman is weird.	davida1019	/r/Mommit/comments/fbvivm/i_just_dont_know_how_to_process_this/	14	10	0	0.92	1583076488.0

when did you know it was time to eff?	hi moms! i am a new mom, our baby girl is 16 days old. she came a few weeks early it took my milk longer than normal to come in, she was losing weight and was pretty small to begin with, so we supplemented after nursing. i also started pumping shortly after she was born. ive been triple feeding and it is really a lot. she sometimes nurses but more just falls asleep on my boob and gobbles up a bottle after. im considering switching to just formula - i definitely think fed is best but i also just dont want to throw in the towel too early, im hopeful shell get bigger and stronger and that shell start to actually nurse. i guess i am just looking for input because im not sure when the right time to make this decision is. i always envisioned ebf but maybe that isnt in the cards for us. also, if any moms nurse just for comfort how does that go? im concerned shell just forgo the breast all together once i stop trying to nurse at every feeding.	wackysackybuddyboy	/r/Mommit/comments/fdkqii/when_did_you_know_it_was_time_to_eff/	13	5	0	0.7	1583359752.0

how do you deal with hitting?	my daughter has decided that she, all of a sudden, decided that hitting when she is mad is ok. we usually do a time out until she apologizes and it seems to work for the most part. and just for the sake of this being reddit we do not believe in spanking or hitting as punishment for a child. last night as i am tucking her in for bed, however, she had a rage fit and hit me. now like i said above we usually do a time out but in this situation she that would be a reward because she wouldn't have to go to sleep so i took away her 5 minutes of light on time and took her book away, explained why, said goodnight and left. she then had a 30-minute screaming crying session because she wanted her light on, this involved her opening her door so i could hear her better . i went in at the 20-minute mark gave her a hug and a little snuggle and explained again why this was happening put her in bed and left letting her cry until she fell asleep. anyways my question is how do you deal with hitting, especially at bedtime?	raysmale	/r/Mommit/comments/fe1tuf/how_do_you_deal_with_hitting/	3	3	0	1.0	1583441377.0

formula weaning onto cows milk, dropping bottles etc. advice needed!	hi all, quick background - i have a 10.5 month old daughter who will be turning one in april. its coming up to that time to switch her to cows milk and just wanting some advice/tips. currently she has 3 x 200ml bottles a day, one for breakfast and dinner and one at around 4 . the amount shes having now is the minimum amount listed on the formula tub . shes beginning to seem like she doesnt need the middle bottle at all and needs less at her bedtime bottle. i dont need advice on changing feeding times as weve tried that, but more so when its okay to drop another bottle or if i should be definitely giving her that minimum amount right up to 12 months? she is an amazing eater and loves her food. but she seems like shed be more likely to have a snack at 4 instead of a bottle now. in regards to the changeover to cows milk, do i swap to cups or keep the bottle? she currently uses cups for water with meals but bottles for her milk feeds. i imagine her bed time bottle will be easier to keep as a bottle as she likes to cuddle up to have it. did you warm the milk? did you slowly introduce it or go cold turkey? anything i should watch for? any help appreciated!!!	bekdoesreddit	/r/Mommit/comments/ffdhpf/formula_weaning_onto_cows_milk_dropping_bottles/	1	1	0	1.0	1583678945.0
suggestions for monthly diaper subscriptions?	i'm trying to put together a list of things that would be useful and i would actually need for my baby registry/to ask for at a baby shower. i've already done a fair bit of thrift store/secondhand shopping and have quite a few friends and family who are offering hand me downs/outgrown furniture, so i've already got a good head start on clothes for the first few months, a bassinet, car seat, etc. what i know would really come in handy are diapers, as i know that will be a big expense, but i don't have the space to store a stockpile of gifted diapers, not to mention there's the chance the sizes/amounts might be inappropriate. i was thinking of asking for a monthly diaper subscription . i was wondering if anyone has used this subscription, or can recommend something similar, or if they have any other suggestions for a diaper fund of some sort that i could use as needed and not end up with boxes and boxes just laying around, because i realize it's unrealistic to expect someone to gift me a gift that keeps on giving vs. a one time thing. even if they gifted the first month, i would be willing to then take over the subscription, but i was wondering if 150-200 diapers for one month at $80 sounds reasonable or if i'm just better off straight buying them. thanks for any advice!	meanmira	/r/Mommit/comments/ffo57p/suggestions_for_monthly_diaper_subscriptions/	2	1	0	1.0	1583722846.0

how daycare helped me to love my daughter more	after a fairly traumatic time getting pregnant, with multiple miscarriages and infant loss, we finally got our rainbow baby. &; but then... i couldn't bond with her. i kept on trying to protect my heart in case things went south again and didn't enjoy my pregnancy at all. i kept on waiting for her heartbeat to not be there, for the birth to go wrong, for her not to survive the first few weeks. &; she came 5 weeks early after i developed pre-eclampsia and was on bed rest and monitored in the hospital for over a week. she stayed in the special care nursery for almost 10 days and she refused to drink from me. i pumped for six months before i finally had enough. i had postnatal depression and was where i just felt numb. i kept on waiting to be told that her real parents were ready to take her now. i went to counselling, to group therapy, to special groups for mums with anxiety and depression and it got better, but i still knew that i wasn't entirely out of the woods yet. &; and then ... my daughter started daycare at 5 months. first one day a week, then two and now three days a week. i work as a relief teacher so some days i have work, and others i don't. but now, i actively miss her in the day. i look forward to spending time with her. and my heart just bursts when she smiles at me. having that distance means i get to enjoy my time with her.i know it can sound odd, but it works for me and for my little family. my rainbow baby is joy and love and she is my world. &; motherlove can look different from what you expect it to be. i never felt that rush of love when my daughter was born, but i have it now when i look at her and cuddle her, almost 7 months later.if this is you, and you are wondering if you are a monster for not feeling that rush of love, you are not. sometimes love is a slow burn.	notherbr1ckinthew4ll	/r/Mommit/comments/fijljs/how_daycare_helped_me_to_love_my_daughter_more/	20	445	0	0.98	1584197874.0

genuine question, not meant to offend why do some people say that they are lucky to be a sahm?	i really don't mean to offend anyone. i know that parenting is hard and people make different choices about whether they want to work while parenting. i just want to understand the perspective of considering yourself lucky to be a stay-at-home parent. i can't really relate to it. maybe it's my own bias because i'm very into my career. when my spouse and i discussed this, we decided that the only scenario in which one of us would be a sahp is if that person's monthly income is equal to or less than the cost of high-quality daycare. both our incomes are higher and we like our jobs a lot, so we are not planning to be sahps. any insight from the other side would be appreciated! and again, i am not invalidating anyone's life choices! edit thanks to all of you for your responses! i really appreciate your input and civility!	planitall	/r/Mommit/comments/fsbp12/genuine_question_not_meant_to_offend_why_do_some/	11	0	0	0.38	1585656130.0

struggling with son's development and the cat	hey folks, so my son is turning 18 months this month and is behind in several of his milestones. the only category where he is up to date on milestones is gross motor skills but he has never spoken, doesn't stack blocks, scribbles and a few others. his pediatrician recommended we use this quarantine time to work with him and we are trying but i can't get him to stay at anything long enough. with the blocks he will sit for a minute, watch me stack them, pick up one to immediately throw on the floor and then he is off to do something else. same with the scribbling, he crumples the paper and runs off with the crayon. his babbling has gotten better as he is trying to say words and we hear new sounds but we just thought by now he would have said something. we are spending money like crazy on books and toys to help with his development and we are somewhat at the same place we started. it's frustrating to say the least. and to make matters worse we adopted a stray cat in february and it keeps trying to bite him. they can't be in the same room together because my son always wants to try and play with it and the cat tries to pounce and bite him. my husband is ready to put the cat out as animal shelters aren't taking any pets rights now and he is at his wits end. so this month of quarantine isn't proving as enlightening as i thought it would be 	yumyum667	/r/Mommit/comments/fx6xkr/struggling_with_sons_development_and_the_cat/	3	2	0	1.0	1586354347.0

how long is too long to keep baby away from grandparents?	hi mamas, i am a ftm with a 6 week old. my mom was able to spend a few days with us during the 1st week, but we haven't been able to spend time with her since then due to covid-19. she has been extremely vigilant with staying home, not allowing any visitors and even having my sister grocery shop for her and leave them on the porch. she and my step dad have been great about staying safe. baby and i are doing the same, but my husband is an essential worker. he has very limited client interaction and is very good about sanitizing and doing what he can to avoid this virus. it really doesn't look like this virus is going away any time soon . i can't imagine keeping our little one away from her grandparents for her entire first year or more, so what are your thoughts on visits? at what point are you going to allow family to visit your kids again? i don't want to risk them getting infected given their age, but missing this time when little one is changing so much every day is really hard on us all. thoughts?	myworldofwater	/r/Mommit/comments/g00pen/how_long_is_too_long_to_keep_baby_away_from/	8	3	0	1.0	1586711939.0
i don't know how to handle this anymore.	we're a month into our relocation to my mom's house from nyc. none of us are sick. yet everything is stressful. my 2 y/o is pooping at midnight and in the middle of the night and waking up from having a huge dirty diaper. she never used to do this at home. we are all exhausted. my 4 y/o goes from being very mature, asking can we go into that room or is there a conference call going on? to having an extremely hard time listening to directives and blatantly doing the opposite of what is asked. i don't know when we will be able to go home. every day is groundhog day. we have a lot to be grateful for, but at least once a day i seriously contemplate how we are going to get though this longterm. any advice would be really helpful.	jazzeriah	/r/Mommit/comments/g2eulv/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_this_anymore/	7	20	0	0.92	1587043548.0

seeking advice for newborn care	hello moms! i am a 31f who is 27 weeks pregnant with her first child . my husband and i do not have children and havent taken care of infants before, besides changing the occasional diaper of a niece/nephew. we are so excited to start our family and go on this messy adventure - pandemic be damned. my question for you all is, was there any literature that helped you become familiar with the very basics of newborn care? e.g., feeding schedules, sleep schedules, foods to avoid, etc.? i was hoping my mother or mil would be able to come help us for the first few weeks but with this virus, that may not be feasible. any advice on how to get through that newborn stage would be so appreciated. i am also nervous about ppd. i have a history of depression, and being isolated with a newborn after birth wont help that. i am also wrapping up my 3l year of law school and im currently scheduled to take the bar about two weeks after she is due so there are multiple stressors being thrown at me. advice on what to look out for v. what is normal would also be appreciated.	thevaginadialogues1	/r/Mommit/comments/g4rzsg/seeking_advice_for_newborn_care/	30	9	0	1.0	1587386204.0
how do i get my 3.5 year old to use the potty??	ugh i need help! my 3.5 year old has used the potty only a handful of times. now, he flat out refuses to use it, even when i know and he knows he has to. we try the most in the morning because he wakes up in his diaper dry and holds it for hours before hell go, peeing through his diaper and pants almost every day. if i take off his diaper and put out the potty, he cries or whines for his diaper back. ive tried bribery of candy, toys, etc. i tried talking to him about it, asking him why he doesnt want to sit . we read potty books, watch potty videos. he doesnt care if hes wet. if he pees himself, he just tells me he needs a bath. im 14 weeks pregnant with 2 and im at my wits end. any tips or tricks????	koshermuffin	/r/Mommit/comments/g4z9lw/how_do_i_get_my_35_year_old_to_use_the_potty/	9	1	0	1.0	1587410398.0
how are you keeping your younger kids motivated and focused for online learning?	i have a 5yo who has been doing preschool online the last few weeks but keeping her focused is a real struggle. she has short daily assignments that should take 15 minutes max and she ends up spending two or three times that to finish. she stares off in to space, tries to talk to me about her toys, tells me how much she loves grandma, etc. its not a skill level issue, everything is perfectly appropriate for her. she just cant sit in a seat and work for more than 30 seconds without losing focus. to be clear, i understand its preschool, not required, and we can stop at any time. i would like to stick with it because shes so unfocused. it seems likely that at least a portion of school will be online this fall and i dont want to give up now just to fight this battle again in a few months. im on maternity leave at the moment so if we need to sit for an extended period of time its okay, that wont be the case in august so a good foundation for this kind of work now seems important.

i don't know how to handle this	i basically feel like i shouldn't even be writing this. i am on all day/night with my 2 and 4 y/o. i try to keep things in perspective. we left nyc on 3/17 and have not been back; we've been at my mom's. no one is sick. we have so much to be grateful for. but i'm always exhausted. just getting through the day and doing things like just going to the grocery store and keeping up with their needs and what my spouse needs is so much work. keeping them safe and cared for involves so much while my spouse continues to work remotely. i am doing my best. but my 4 y/o has stopped doing any of her letters that she used to do back in nyc. she barely gets through a 30-minute zoom session of her pre-k class when she used to go to pre-k for 3+ hours 5 days/week happily with no problem. she used to say please and thank you all the time and now she refuses to do this and she just cries instead. she's a happy child and is well taken care of all the time. i don't get it. i am just trying to get us all through the day safely and hopefully somewhat happily, and we get outside every day, even though the weather here is still winter but i feel like we've just regressed so much. we used to be so much better than this. how do you deal with this? it feels interminable. please help me get through this!	jazzeriah	/r/Mommit/comments/g5thqz/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_this/	2	2	0	0.75	1587524719.0
needing some advice!	what would you do if your caregiver just completely disregarded the things you told him and asked him to do with your child? my son is 19 months and we dont want him to have juice, just milk and water right now, and this is the third time ive caught a sippy cup full of juice at my grandpas. hes never once apologized for giving it to him when hes caught. he also refuses to listen to us when we give him advice on how to get him to eat, and what to work on with him . he thinks he knows more than us bc hes older and has more experience raising kids . im so fed up and dont know what to do. i get its free childcare and im so fortunate to have that, but im starting to think its not worth the frustration.	mamaskywalker829	/r/Mommit/comments/g604vo/needing_some_advice/	4	3	0	1.0	1587558080.0
sahms - what is it like?	like the title says, i would love to hear from anyone who is or was a sahm about what it is like. now that we are over a month into the shelter in place, i have to admit that i care less about working and more about spending time with my daughter. my husband and i decided that i am not going to go back to work full time, but the question is whether to go back part time or not to go back at all. i current work as an attorney and before all of this started, i would leave the house every day at 7 00am and the earliest that i would ever get home is 6 00pm. i would maybe see my daughter for 20 minutes in the morning and 1-2 hours at night. even before the pandemic forced me to stay at home, it was getting increasing difficult to leave her. some of my concerns though about staying at home would be the lack of adult interaction that i have on a daily basis. part of me also feels like if i stopped working, then all my hard work towards a law degree and years of practicing law were a waste, even though i think raising my daughter and our future children will be worth the sacrifice. then there is the fear of what will i do when the kids are gone, although i expect that my husband will not be working by then either and we will just travel. these are the things i am struggling with and would love to hear from other moms who made a similar decision and how it went. .	whatdoiknowiamadog	/r/Mommit/comments/g6eqm6/sahms_what_is_it_like/	8	3	0	1.0	1587609378.0

advice? 	im currently doing a night shift, holding my 10 week-old. shes going through this phase where she will only sleep in our arms. she sleeps through the entire night , but like i said, only while being held at this point. its been really tough because im lucky if i even get 3 hours of sleep after my shift. im trying to be strong and take it day by day, anticipating when shes finally a toddler. can you guys give me advice for what got you through this? hearing that other people are going through/have gone through this is what keeps me from going crazy sometimes.	mrsmamamella	/r/Mommit/comments/g7n6fe/advice_10_weekold/	5	2	0	1.0	1587787606.0
how long did you sleep with your babies in your bed? what age did you finally tell them they where ready for their own bed?	i have a beautiful daughter who's 19 months now and i love having her in my bed. she loves it too because of the warm cuddles and plus she still breastfeeds. i'm hoping keeping her in my bed won't have a negative affect on her being able to self soothe or eventually sleep in her own bed or bedroom. so how long did you let your babes sleep with you? edit hi again guys! i just read all your comments and i just wanted to share a bit more info. i bed sleep with my daughter safely and follow all the standards needed to take. not every mama is the same and some of us like our littles next to us. plus i have a small co- sleeper bed connected to mine so she really isnt in the parental bed anyways. when i first had my girl i didn't co sleep for the first 6 weeks, but i was so sleep deprived due to her colicky self and she had trouble latching for a while so the constant up and down was too much. we both needed sleep and it worked for our family. plus again she has a co- sleeper right next to our bed. thank you though for all your comments i really appreciate it and i feel better to just let her wean herself from sleeping next to me just as i intend to do so with breastfeeding. best wishes to all you awesome mamas!!	_lionkat_	/r/Mommit/comments/g7rjnf/how_long_did_you_sleep_with_your_babies_in_your/	13	7	0	0.82	1587811435.0
need advice from other cosleepers	my lo is 10 months and is starting to fight us every time she's tired. we have a routine where we rock her in a chair, then move to the bed to snuggle and drink milk. she'll nap for around 1-2 hours or if it's bed time, she'll sleep for 8-10 hours - where she'll wake up once for milk. now, she screams if we sit in the chair or even pat her. she's waking up several times a night, she fusses in her sleep, she's only napping for 30 minutes. it's not teething or gas as far as i can tell. my husband snores, but she sleeps better if she's right next to him, so that's not an issue. we asked the doctor, but he harped on a separate bed and doing the extinction method. does anyone else who cosleeps have any advice?	korenestis	/r/Mommit/comments/g7xnb8/need_advice_from_other_cosleepers/	3	2	0	0.75	1587836343.0
has anyone switched jobs or interviewed during pregnancy? advice needed!	hi all! i never thought i'd be on the job hunt while 26 weeks pregnant but as many have said before, times are tough! i actually still have a job with my current company, but the business we're in is not doing well and i'm bracing for layoffs to happen sooner than later. my plan was originally to ride it out, go down with the ship, hope for a severance, and best case scenario i don't get laid off and i'm able to take my planned maternity leave. worst case scenario, i lose my job and we tighten our belts on my husband's salary until i'm ready to go rejoin the workforce after the baby is born. the tough thing about that is that i've always made significantly more than my husband, we're both on my insurance and i really don't think we would last long on his salary alone. so i decided to apply for jobs, but only if they looked like jobs i'd be really interested in. well this week a friend reached out because a job popped up at her company that seems like a perfect fit for me. if pregnancy weren't part of the equation, this would be a very very good career move for me, so i applied and was offered an interview on the same day. this is equal parts exciting and confusing for me. i'm going to go into the interview prepared and do my best to crush it . my main question is...in the event that i'm offered the position and decide to take it, since i would be forfeiting all my my parental leave at my old company and no longer be eligible for fmla does it seem like a good idea to try and negotiate time off after the baby is born after they've offered me the position during salary negotiations? or should i hold off until after i've decided to take the position to let them know that i'm due to give birth at the end of july? side note i know this post is pretty job-oriented, but i'm totally heartbroken that the maternity leave i'd been looking forward to taking might no longer be an option. i'm a ftm and know that those weeks postpartum will be so incredibly important for bonding and just learning how to be a parent before heading back into the workforce. i hate that these are decisions i have to make, but i also need to provide for my family and i want to be able to give her a wonderful life. this sucks.	emflan11	/r/Mommit/comments/g7yd8h/has_anyone_switched_jobs_or_interviewed_during/	4	3	0	0.81	1587838662.0
but where did the sleep go??	we. are. so. tired. my husband and i have a 3 yo and a 5 mo. im finishing my last semester of law school and working part time while my husband is working his full time job from home due to the pandemic. that is a lot of busy but we were getting used that. not sending 3 yo to preschool has made it so hard to get anything done of course. not being able to let our family visit has been so sad. we feel like were being robbed of our time with them during our babys infancy. but my parents are older and have health issues so were doing everything we can to encourage them to be careful so theyre okay when this all ends. we were beyond grateful because 5 mo was sleeping 7-9 hour stretches at night. she would even peacefully fall asleep sometimes on her own without needing to be perfectly guided to slumber. lol. we knew this was lucky because our first daughter only slept in 1.5 hour chunks basically until she was 1. and then 2 weeks ago, the sleep stopped. 5 mo is still napping pretty well, usually 4 naps of about 45 minutes. but then bedtime - she fights it and takes hours to go to bed. then shes up constantly. constantly. we even did a teleheath appointment with her pediatrician to check in about it and to check in on the baby eczema. we have good cream for that, but i know it could be itching her and keeping her awake. i know she could be going through a growth spurt. i know any minute now it could turn around again. shes super happy during the day. shes eating plenty and growing fast. but the sleep. its just gone. and of course it would happen when i cant have anyone come help us. thank you for reading!	scarrawr	/r/Mommit/comments/g8f0oo/but_where_did_the_sleep_go/	4	5	0	1.0	1587910507.0

how do i go to school full time and parent?	im m not sure if this is the right place to post this but here it goes. some background information my husband and i met at school and got married last june. we moved away from the school for my husbands internship and i took a year of from school, because for many reasons i couldnt continue the masters program i was in online. well, we got pregnant right away and now have our beautiful 2 month old baby! im not working at all during his internship year, just caring for our son. now we both plan to return to classes full time in the fall. both of us will be completing our last year of classes for our masters. our current plan is to sign up for classes so that one of us can always be watching our son. our income wont allow us to afford daycare and we wont have any family close by. there are a few times we will need a babysitter, but for the most part one of us will be able to watch him while the other is in class. we only have one car, so we will most likely drive to school, stay until we are both done with classes for the day, then drive home. my question is, how will we manage to be full time students and parents? i know people have done it and with hard work its possible. have any of you been in this situation? what are your tips? thanks for reading and for any thoughts you can offer.

trying to build milk supply, but i'm not getting much when i pump	hello all! i posted a while back whilst having a giant freak out over my upcoming scheduled c-section. the hilarious part is that baby bear decided to come on the friday before we were supposed to be admitted to the hospital, so i actually had less time to panic. all is well, he's healthy, mostly happy with occasional grumps, and growing like a weed! however, i am returning to work in the upcoming month, and bb is going to daycare so i've been trying to get milk stored so i'll have plenty to send with him. my problem is that when i started, i was pumping a good 3oz in the morning and 2 oz in the evening. lately i'm lucky to get 1oz per breast at each pumping session. i'm starting to panic, because bb eats an entire 3oz bottle when dh does his 12am feed. so now, it takes me at least 2 sessions to replace his bottle, much less get some stored in the freezer for later. does anyone have any advice? i'm not panicking, because bb still seems happy and healthy, but is there any way to increase milk supply? do i need to increase my supply at all? is this normal?

just needing a vent to someone who will understand.	heading pretty much sums it up. i have a recently turned one year old girl. shes our first baby and was very wanted by us both. shes been a pretty good baby her whole life with a few bad periods here and there. in the last two weeks, she had her needles, shes in a development leap and shes cut two top teeth. she has been up through the night again, screaming in pain even with panadol and bonjela and is now learning to throw tantrums. im at the end of my rope. i hear her crying in the morning after ive had no sleep and i want to put a pillow over my head and never take it off. my husband does not understand at all how much of a toll it can take on you when youre being screamed at all day. he says really unhelpful things, he wont do basic things that would really help me feel a bit less smothered. im beginning to really resent him because he doesnt understand how i feel and isnt trying to. i know so many more people have it worse through all this, but i used to be able to throw her in the pram and go to the shops when she was like this and now i cant do that either. i dont know, im just looking for someone to say itll be okay and that i wont feel this overwhelmed forever. i honestly am not coping at all and want to run away from my own house half the time.	bekdoesreddit	/r/Mommit/comments/gai0qc/just_needing_a_vent_to_someone_who_will_understand/	5	3	0	1.0	1588195259.0

struggling without zofran	so my doctor thinks i should take something other than zofran because my post partum anxiety is inducing the nausea. well that and the fact that i am two months or so postpartum c section. my lower abdomen feels like it keeps contracting and pulsing which makes me nervous. but i don't have time to be nervous with a two month baby depending on me. my appointment isn't until next week. what should i do? i'm trying so hard to get through this. the buspar they gave me only makes me more nervous but the panic attacks can be overwhelming. i just want to be happy and healthy for my baby girl and husband.

reddit moms, i am at the end of my rope. someone please give me some advice.	so like most kids, my son is having trouble sleeping. he is 11 months old right now and will be 1 year old may 25th. his bedtime is somewhere between 7-8 pm depending. he usually wakes up for the morning at 7 am. he use to be pretty good at putting himself to sleep but then recently went back to needing to be rocked to sleep in order to go to bed. i don't want to keep this up as much as i love the snuggles because he wont learn how to put himself to sleep. &; anyway, he goes to bed at lets say 7 and sleeps until like midnight and then wakes up crying and screaming for hours and wont go back to sleep no matter what i do. rock him, he cries, give him a bottle which he shouldn't even be having anymore at night so says our doctor, and he drinks it and then still wont sleep. don't rock him and he cries or plays and jumps in the bed. i know being a parent means little sleep but this is driving me to the edge. i feel somewhat resentful of him sometimes and it really pisses me off sometimes which makes me feel even worse because i know he is just a baby and that he is just as tired as i am or maybe his mouth hurts. &; i don't know what to do? i know he has teeth coming in which hurts i know, so i give him tylenol or teething toys to help during the day etc. i just don't know what to do anymore. he is even starting to do it during his nap time which means he is getting even more sleep. he has a schedule that we try to stick to or change if something isn't working but right now nothing is working! &; sorry this was so long, but it has brought me to tears more times than i can count, or i've had to call into work because i haven't slept in days and i can't take it anymore! i feel like i have a newborn again and i can't anymore. i've read tons of articles but none of it is helping. i am a single mom but my mom lives with us and helps me too. sometimes i just have to ask her to deal with it because i just cant anymore and i need a break. which also makes me feel bad because i feel like i should be able to handle it all on my own like other moms do but i just can't. like the other night he wouldn't go back to sleep, he was awake for over 3 hours and i just sat on the couch with him in the dark while he looked around and i just cried and cried. &; so to recap, 1. how can i get my kid to sleep through the night more. 2. how can i stop giving him bottles at night and help him learn to fall asleep on his own without being rocked or needing a bottle to go to bed. 3. am i the only one that gets so mad at their kid? i don't show it to him but inside i am so hopeless and pissed off all i can do is cry sometimes. here is his new schedule we made before i posted this.

11 month old doesn't want solids	i've been trying to get my lo to eat solids since 6 months. i've had very little success. she likes yogurt and will sometimes eat puffs, warm cereals, apple sauce, bananas, and some baby purees. i've tried purees, chunks, her feeding herself, me feeding her, but we always have the same result she takes three bites and then is done. she drinks plenty of breast milk, usually around 30 ounces a day and she does take propranolol, but she's been on that since 3 months and hasn't had any issues. she's got 8 teeth right now and i think she's on a break from teething, but i'm not sure. does anyone have any advice or recommendations?	korenestis	/r/Mommit/comments/ghs8ck/11_month_old_doesnt_want_solids/	4	1	0	1.0	1589218588.0

how did you teach your baby to talk? am i too focused on it?	hey everyone, looking for some insight from those with more experience. my baby is one year old and starting to make sounds other than mama/dada/nana. do i have to actively/ obsessively teach him the name for everything or will he pick it up naturally through observing those around him? i watched some videos on youtube from a few mom bloggers who obsessively hover over their babies and teach them words all day long. it almost seems unhealthy how focused they are on their babies development. i guess im just looking for reassurance that i dont need to be this annoying to my baby. yes, we play games, read lots of books, and i try to teach him words throughout the day. but i dont want to go overboard... he still needs quiet time to explore and be on his own too. thanks for your advice!!! tldr how did your baby learn to talk? was it super natural or did you take a very active role in teaching their first words?	spinach888	/r/Mommit/comments/gjpxuc/how_did_you_teach_your_baby_to_talk_am_i_too/	7	1	0	1.0	1589474588.0

for those with flexible work spaces, when are you sending your kids back to daycare?	 we have a toddler and are expecting a baby in august. both of our workplaces have announced a work-from-home option pretty much indefinitely. my husbands boss said hes not coming in until theres a vaccine. i had planned on taking a year off on maternity leave anyway so i wont have to go back until at least sept 2021. the issue is our toddler was going to daycare and misses it and i miss it, too. daycare was supposed to be the constant for her, especially as our family grows, we would have kept her in daycare and i would have just stayed home with the new baby for a year. i really dont enjoy being a stay-at-home mom. i know it works well for some but it is completely draining for me. with a newborn and under 1 year, i can do it fine, but a toddler is just sooo draining. two would of course be rough, especially if my toddler cant do all the normal things we do like going to the playground or zoo. i feel like my mental health is all out of wack. at the same time, i obviously dont want my family to get sick or die or have lifelong complications. but now we dont really have a threshold for when we go back. its not when our workplaces demand us back, so when is it? is anyone else in a similar situation? what are you thinking of doing? are there certain things youre waiting for to happencertain things to open, certain advances in the science, etc? what factors are going into your decision?

how do i give my infant enough attention while working?	hi mommas! like many of you i am navigating working from home with a baby right now. in my case my son is almost 6 months old. initially working with my baby was just survival mode. i did whatever kept him happy and calm enough to do work. unfortunately, the answer is mostly watching sesame street for a couple hours a day while he plays in his jumper or activity seat, or hangs out on my lap. he can sit up unassisted a little but not reliably enough to do it without me there to catch him. i know babies shouldn't have screen time, let alone hours a day of it. i feel so guilty that i can't give him more attention and i really worry it's going to affect him. i make sure he does tummy time in the afternoon - i leave my desk and work off my laptop in the living room where he can play on the floor. but he's not getting as much human interaction as he really should. my so can't help much because he's on the phone almost all day. anyone in a similar situation have tips or suggestions to keep him entertained in a more appropriate way?

simple tip for parents who feed formula 	so when i first started using formula i didnt want to go buy a dispenser thing and i kept getting formula on the rim of the bottle while trying to pre-make some bottles for the morning. i hated it! but i had attempted pumping so i still had all of my funnels, breastmilk storage bottles, etc. dont throw them away! grab your milk storage bottles and use them to store your formula for on the go, or just to make the hassle of wondering if its been 24 hr since you made the bottle- blah blah... use the funnel to minimize mess and not have to buy a whole formula dispenser, close them up, and there you go. have a bottle with water that you can simply heat up, formula, mix. you always will have a fresh bottle and it makes everything just a little simpler. i know its something simple but in the beginning i wish i was doing it but with my tired mom brain i didnt really think of it and had to keep track of times when i made bottles and had to dump some bottles.. formula is expensive. so there we go.. just a simple tip i think is helpful to hopefully make things easier for you too. what i use 80ml medela breastmilk storage and freezing bottles + any sized funnel but i use the 21 mm. the 80ml doesnt have a wide curved neck like normal bottles, they can hold 4 full scoops so enough to make an 8oz bottle.		/r/Mommit/comments/gmxl8s/simple_tip_for_parents_who_feed_formula/	3	10	0	0.92	1589923319.0

advice regarding my 5 y/o nephew	hi everyone! i found this subreddit searching the web for advice regarding my 5 year old nephew. my sister asked me for help because her son fell two weeks ago and cut his cheek and needed seven stitches. he handled the injury like a champ. after five minutes he stopped crying while he sat on the couch holding a wet cloth up to his injury. it was clear he needed stitches and he was so upset about going to the hospital. i understand this is traumatic for any child as they are scared and don't know what to expect. that being said, on top of the typical feelings of fear that children face in this situation, he also hates going to the doctors or being around anyone he doesn't know. he will hide and it takes a long time for him to warm up to you. he obviously was going to do everything in his power to fight going to the place where a stranger was going to be sewing his face. understandably, this was a very traumatic experience for him. today he fell running around their paved driveway and he had an intense emotional reaction despite it being a scraped knee, something this clumsy kid has nearly all summer long. i'm assuming this is normal behavior as he likely was reminded of how scared he was during the previous incident. however, he also wouldn't let his mom near him for hours after he scraped his knee today. she's visually impaired so she needs to be close to see if he needs a bandaid, etc. she promised not to touch it and he kept telling her to go away and wouldn't allow her in the same room as him. she told him she just wanted to help him feel better. finally before bed, he let her put ointment on it and a bandaid. she wants to know what she can do to help him feel less afraid and support him after he gets hurt or any advice in general that might help the situation. has anyone been in a similar situation? thanks in advance for any input you might have!

baby wash suggestions	i'm beautiful girl is cursed with my sensitive skin. it took me a long time to get soaps and lotions that work well for my skin. we have been using little journeys baby wash from aldis and has been working but it seems like it started causing a rash on her tummy, back, and legs. nothing has changed. we have tried multiple johnson and johnson brands, hello bello, and babyganics. all caused rashes and irritation. switching to an unscented laundry detergent also. like i said earlier, nothing has changed. the same thing happens to me every now and again. i will be using the same product for along time with no problems until out of the blue it starts causing issues. any suggestions would help! please and thank you!

i need help/ideas for how to handle 2 highly destructive boys!!!	my boys are ages 6 and 3, and for the most part, they are a complete joy to be around. however, they have a destructive streak a mile wide. they share a bedroom and they have destroyed their carpet, put holes in the walls, torn down curtains and destroyed the rods, torn their closet up so bad that i had to put a lock at the top to keep them out of their clean clothes, destroyed 3 different beds/bed setups, and now have completely disassembled their mattress . i feel horrible for the state of their room but i don't know how to keep anything in their room from being completely destroyed. i have tried again and again to keep their room clean and orderly, but the destruction is out of control and getting worse since school has been out due to covid. i don't know which one is the one destroying or if it's just the fact that they are together, and the fact that they are going to have to sleep on the bare floor because they took the binding off their mattress and tied each other up with it is something that is sending all sorts of red flags up in my head as some sort of child abuse, but i don't know what else to do because i'm broke and mattresses are stupid expensive. i'm home with them all day, i make sure they get at least 2-3 hours a day outside, my oldest doesn't take a nap, but my 3-year-old does because it seems to make the destruction slightly less, and i try to keep them entirely away from their 18-month-old sister because i don't want her even slightly exposed to that kind of behavior or to think it's acceptable. i've been battling this with my oldest for over 4 years, and it's just started with the 3-year-old. at the rate they're going, they will destroy my entire house before my husband and i finish paying for it. as it is, because of their behavior when i turn my back for as little as 30 seconds , the flooring and floor in the hall bathroom needs replaced, the hall carpet needs to be pulled out and the floor underneath likely needs replaced, there is irreparable damage to the sliding door to the back yard, and all of the flooring in the entire house . one of their worst habits is that as soon as they are not being actively monitored at night, they take off their pull-ups and pee wherever they want to, which is never inside the toilet. usually its the hall floor, or around the toilet, or the middle of the living room floor. it's so frequent that no matter what i do, the hall and bathroom always smell like a lovely mixture of urine and mold. the behavior seems to be the greatest in the night or early morning. they go to bed at 7 and 7 30 pm and i wake up at 6 am. by the state of the house every morning i would estimate that they've been awake for hours. i've tried putting them to bed later, it makes it worse, like they aren't getting enough sleep. i can't put them to bed any earlier because this summer sun is starting to keep them awake at night until it gets dark, which wouldn't be an issue if they hadn't destroyed every curtain rod i've put in their room with blackout curtains. i've tried no naps, enforced naps, different bedtime rituals, everything i can think of, and this just keeps getting more and more out of control. any ideas would be great. my husband thinks i'm joking when i say there are boarding schools for first graders, but i'm starting to think that might be the only solution to saving my house, certainly less expensive. the most frustrating thing is that they don't behave like this for anyone other than my husband and i, despite our best efforts to copy the habits of the people the boys behave for.

how soon should i expect a walker?	hey there, im new to reddit but i am looking for some advice for as newer mommy. i have a soon to be eight month old, ball of energy, who has mastered crawling and couch surfing. he loves his walker and sprints short distances without hesitation. how soon did your mini-you start walking after the couch surfing began? we have already baby proofed in preparation but not sure when to expect him to start running marathons.	dmj1988	/r/Mommit/comments/gvi8x2/how_soon_should_i_expect_a_walker/	12	0	0	0.5	1591139641.0
when to talk about racism with kids?	i dont want to talk to my girls about race. they are kids; 4 and 6. they are young, white, innocent children who shouldnt have to be burdened by hatred of our world. its an ugly, uncomfortable topic. police brutality is confusing . i want to keep them young and innocent- unencumbered by the ugliness that im ashamed of in our society. the children, who have not left the house in 3 months due to covid, are completely unaware of the riots happening. small town life so, its not even in their peripheral. i could totally ignore it. let them keep that childhood innocence a little longer. but, today i watched my children play in the yard with their friends- their diverse group of friends. one is black, one is latino, 3 are syrian, and only one other is white. that innocence i want to keep-- that is white privilege. that is me not wanting to have an uncomfortable conversation because its not fun. i guarantee their friends have had to talk to their parents about racism. i guarantee their friends know about george floyd. im actually aware that one of these friends changed school when kids were picking on him for his ethnic name, and the school refused to help. so, i bucked up. i sat my kids down and talked about blacklivesmatter. i told them that i will always defend them if they are doing the right thing, and standing up for someone else. we spoke about racism, and ugliness, and that they need to be aware and sensitive to the matter. i told them i expect them to stand up against it if they ever saw bias, or heard bad words. i let them know my expectations regarding inclusion. i mentioned george floyd by name. i asked them their opinion, and if they had questions. and then they asked if they could have a snack. and life went on. i have no idea if they got it. but, the door is open. if black kids have to have the talk then so do mine. this wont be our last discussion on the matter, but it had to start somewhere. so- to the other's in my situation... if you haven't already, it's time. tl;dr we have to talk to our kids about racism, even if it makes us uncomfortable.

how we can help right now	as a new parent, ive struggled with how i can be supportive to the black community without being out on the front lines. part of my solution is to support black-owned businesses and to make donations to organizations that can bridge the gap between where i am and what needs to be done. if you also want to help but dont feel comfortable being on the front lines like me, here are some helpful links ive found baby/kids toys books and clothing - have conversations with friends and family about racism - check out from your local library about racism and how to be an anti-racist - have conversations with your kid about whats going on - think about who your kids are seeing in books and on tv. help your child see heroes/characters of different races and ethnic backgrounds. please add to this if you have other resources or information that can be helpful to us all. as parents we have an amazing opportunity to raise loving humans that can create change. be safe!

how to stop the fighting	hello reddit. i'm a mom of 2, just had our second in april. i have a 6 year old daughter that i feel i have lost control of. she is constantly undermining everything i say and do for her. runs around the house making a mess of pretty much everything. i hold her responsible for the messes she makes but she does not care and will continue doing as she pleases. it's an everyday battle. when i am trying to talk with her she interrupts me or is clearly not listening like she does not care. i know these are just kid things but i feel it is a bit extreme how much she behaves this way. i don't think it's normal. i know she is struggling right now with the way things are in world but i feel completely defeated as a mother to her. i would not say she is unkind to others, she is a very sweet, caring person but she is off track and i don't know how to correct this. i am struggling with ppd and trying to work this out with my doctor. i know this probably has a lot to do with how i am parenting her right now.	whereisbobbie	/r/Mommit/comments/gvzcqm/how_to_stop_the_fighting/	4	2	0	0.75	1591208501.0

breastfeeding advice?	im due in august and a little background, my little one will have heart surgery in his first week and will need to be in the hospital for at least a month immediately after for recovery. as a result i wont be able to breastfeed very much until he recovers, but i am adamant that i want to have him on breastmilk cause i know itll be best for him, whether thats through an ng or by the bottle or occasional breastfeeding when hes strong enough. i could use any info you have on keeping up a milk supply while only pumping. ill be in the hospital majority of the time with my little one and probably wont have extensive healthy grocery access, but is increasing fat/calories in breastmilk by what i eat possible? im not sure if thats a thing, but he will need help with weight gain cause of his condition in order to be sent home after surgery. and in case theres questions/advice regarding fortifying, we really dont want to fortify my breastmilk or put him on formula due to other complications that are common with his condition and linked to fortifying and formula feeding like reflux, throwing up, gas, stomach pain, oral aversions etc any tips on just making pumping easier and more bearable are appreciated. and recommendations for really good pumps! im so willing but i know itll be hard. thanks in advance! tldr; need advice for pumping, increasing/maintaining milk supply, possibly increasing the calories in my milk and pump recommendations. baby has a heart condition that makes it hard for him to feed and needs to gain weight before going home. want to avoid fortification and formula.	hellograpefruit	/r/Mommit/comments/gwpno2/breastfeeding_advice/	3	3	0	1.0	1591303010.0
how to politely tell another mom to stop sexualizing the relationship between our toddlers?	i've just started fostering a relationship with another family in our neighborhood so that our toddlers f and d can have a friend to play with. things are going well and it's super adorable seeing them play together. i get that she's trying to be funny and they are really super cute, but it bothers my that my kid is being sexualized already. she seems really nice and is trying hard to foster a relationship with me as well. i'm hoping to phrase it in a way that is polite, quick and makes her realize what she's doing isn't good for either our toddlers. i would love to hear ideas on phrasing or other stories!

any tips for refluxy newborns?	we had our little girl on wednesday evening. she's gorgeous and super snuggly and an excellent feeder, but gets so refluxy when lying on her back, she wakes within 2 minutes of going into the bassinet, usually choking on her vomit. consequently, she has had to be continuously held since she was 12 hours old. i am sleep deprived to the point of being dangerous. even if it has been 2 hours since her last feed, she always chucks up if put on her back. she settles well in my arms with shushing and patting, and it's not the act of transfer that wakes her- it's being on her back and the consequent vomit. she is just a very refluxy kid- when we are tummy to tummy i often hear her bring up a mouthful of milk and swallow it back down. i am not prepared to risk violating safe sleep guidelines; and a major priority is breastfeeding; but this cannot continue. any ideas?	sweet_chick283	/r/Mommit/comments/gxpsj6/any_tips_for_refluxy_newborns/	5	2	0	1.0	1591445154.0

if you want a simple straightforward thing we can all do to encourage empathy and a respect for diversity get your kid a 'not-white' doll.	obviously your kid might be old enough they don't want dolls. but if they are under 10 of any gender buy, make, trade for them a 'not white' doll. boy dolls, latina dolls, asian dolls all of it. i know they're usually more expensive and that sucks. i know often black/african american dolls don't have natural hair styles. just find a way to make sure they also have not white dolls. from age three concepts of race are being formed. wash the babies the same, have them feed and cloth them and yes they'll be not careful and kind of throw all the dolls around the same but if you are looking for something you can do, something that's not a huge statement to your racist parents, that's not a long complicated conversation you don't know how to have with your 3 year old, that's not putting your body at risk in protests. get your boys, your girls of every ethnicity a doll that's not white, hopefully a full spectrum. i get it. i am a white woman in a fairly white town with young kids and i hadn't actually bought the dolls, they were all gifts. they were white because my white kids deserve to see themselves reflected as well, but i bet you already have a white doll, make it, borrow it, whatever just get the doll. there's scientific articles but they're behind a paywall so here's one from parents magazine 	unsulliedbread	/r/Mommit/comments/gyi3bw/if_you_want_a_simple_straightforward_thing_we_can/	3	8	0	0.76	1591556287.0

3.5 weeks old - struggling with sleep	hi moms - first time mom to a 3.5 week old daughter here. this is a rant + desperate plea for help, apologies for the long post. summary of my daughter this far except for the first few hours, she has fought the breast, and hence i have had to bottle feed her - formula at first and now mostly expressed milk. she had to be rehospitalised for jaundice in her first week . her second week, as she recovered from jaundice, she got very gassy and colicky. she would cry for nearly 6-8 hours because she was uncomfortable, and she wouldn't sleep, making her tired and even crankier. in her third week , colic drops helped ease her gas, so the crying reduced. she also stopped fighting the breast - she suckles at it , but doesn't latch properly. hence this week i thought things will get better, but now she hardly sleeps during the day, and that's beginning to mess up her night time routine as well. her typical daytime feed + nap cycle begins when she gets tired but doesn't want to sleep or even close her eyes. on a good cycle, after about an hour in my arms she will eventually close her eyes and nap for another 30m . she will wake herself up with a sound or arm movement and then i have to coax her back to sleep again. about 30m before her next feed i leave her in her bassinet and quickly pump and get her next feed ready. on a bad day , i cannot put her down for even 2m and have to get her feed etc ready while carrying a wailing girl in my arms this is her day for the last 5 days wake for a feed between 5-6 , go back to sleep, but slightly fitful sleep. wake around 9.30 - first alert window, look around, maybe look at a toy for 30m. then my first struggle with a nap cycle. next attempt at 12-30-1, then a small feed around 4.30-5. 30m -1.5h of keeping her calm, and then bath time . quick massage, change of clothes and another feed and another attempt at putting her to sleep. this is usually when we run out of energy as well, and so begins the pacifier dance while we get dinner and finish other chores. eventually she falls into a deep sleep, and due to fatigue she goes 4+ hrs without a feed . somewhere between 10&12 she will have another big feed and then she's good. she quickly falls asleep after the feed and wakes after 4 hours for another feed, before starting the day again. as she is struggling with sleeping so much, and needs to be soothed and rocked to sleep so often in the day, that i spend nearly 14-15hrs in a darkened room with her. it's making it really difficult to pull myself out a low mood, aside from of course being worried about if she's doing fine. any advice on how i can get her to nap during the day? we have tried swaddling, pacifier, white noise, shhhing , rocking, walking around, sleeping next to her, but nothing we do gets her to sleep well where she doesn't wake up flash eyed and cranky. p.s. it's just my husband and me taking care of her ,bad my husband is wfh so he can help out, but bulk of chores related to her falls on me. as some of these chores can't be done while holding her, i am struggling to squeeze these in. please help	Ditibo88	/r/Mommit/comments/h0ky3y/35_weeks_old_struggling_with_sleep/	8	2	0	1.0	1591825253.0

advice for a mama feeling anxious about introducing solids?	my son is almost 9 months old and the absolute light of my life. weve been doing pures since about 6 months, but only recently started doing them consistently bc hes not a huge eater and didnt enjoy the texture. now im feeling like i should start introducing more whole cooked foods, but every time i try i have such intense anxiety about him choking that i nearly start crying and end up just taking the food away after a handful of bites. i dont want to do him a disservice by not letting him experience new textures, but i can also tell that he knows im stressed. has anyone else dealt with this and what did you tell yourself to get over it? or did you just stick with pures until your lo was a little older?

i need advice about my toddler's eating	hi all! so my son is nearly 2 years old and ever since i moved him on from purees he has not been interested in eating fresh fruit or vegetables. it's definitely a texture thing. ^ i haven't done anything to try to fix my son's eating habits even though my sister in law is on my case about it every time i see her. i just figure he will come right eventually. i make him smoothies with fresh fruit, i make him baked food items with fruit and vegetables, he eats pureed fruit in his porridge for breakfast and he will eat some dried fruit. he is a healthy little boy, almost never sick and gaining weight as expected. he eats avocado on toast and will eat almost anything else that's not fresh fruit or veg. i don't know if i should be stressing about this and trying to fix him? have other mums had kids like him and did they get worse or better with time? should i intervene while he's still little or just leave him? i don't want to make mealtimes stressful for us so i haven't fought him to eat the food he clearly doesn't want to eat. i just need some advice going forward. thank you for reading my massive spiel and any advice that can be given! - 	martinettegreer	/r/Mommit/comments/h7f03p/i_need_advice_about_my_toddlers_eating/	5	1	0	1.0	1591940885.0
question from a new mom! please help!	i have an exactly one month old baby. he is the sweetest and best think that has ever happened to me and i am so happy! my question is about sleep. wow! such an original topic. lol! i know that there are no magic words or easy answers to my problem. i just need some ideas and i can't seem to get it from google. makes more sense to ask a community of warrior moms like yourselves. when my husband and i brought our beautiful baby boy home from the hospital, we were fully aware that sleeping through the night with no interruptions would be a thing of the past. a luxury of childless days gone by. but we didnt know that he would not sleep in his bassinet even for one minute. my son was in the nicu for two days and he seemed to sleep pretty well in their plastic bassinets so what the heck!? after that first night, my husband and i decided it would be better to sleep in shifts. so, my husband slept at night while i stayed awake since he was still working for a couple more weeks. i would go to bed in the morning when he woke up while he watched the baby. it works out pretty well. however, it's become really depressing because now my husband and i barely ever see eachother. we are like ships in the night. and we aren't sleeping together. i have asked friends what they did to get sleep with a newborn. most of them said sleep when he sleeps here's the problem with that my baby doesn't sleep unless he is in my arms. as soon as i put him down he cries. i can't sleep with him in my arms because of the danger involved. luckily i can't sleep with him in my arms no matter how tired i am because his breathing keeps me awake and if i can't hear him breathing then i panic. when do babies start sleeping at night? so they ever? will my husband and i ever be able to be a married couple again? what am i doing wrong? insert more questions any tips? tricks? pep talks? suggestions? thank you!	skyrimisdope123	/r/Mommit/comments/h7r5m8/question_from_a_new_mom_please_help/	16	5	0	1.0	1591989443.0
three year old not sleeping at all, any advice?	im writing this while trying to get him to sleep at 7am after having been up since 2 30am, waking up since he went to bed at 7 30pm, woke up again at 10pm, went to sleep at 11pm, then woke up and stayed up at 2 30am. it has been this non stop and sometimes worse for months now. sleep doctor told us to keep trying to do the things she told us to do, which weve followed pretty much to the letter, its not helping. 2.5mg of melatonin anytime from 7-7 30, sometimes doesnt even work getting him to sleep. he has the same energy level during the day as if hed gotten a full nights rest, he has never napped. i had a psychotic break because of how stressed i am from not sleeping. my husband isnt working but it stresses me out even more when hes watching our son on very little sleep because he snaps and yells at the slightest misstep. no one can take him to give us a full nights rest and i dont trust my mother in law to watch him because the last time we did she left him downstairs alone when we asked her to watch him while we took a nap. with access to everything in the kitchen and living room completely unsupervised. hes a climber and curious. i went to go pee and saw him sitting on the coffee table in the living room with his giant thing of animal crackers and gave up trying to nap. he sleeps in his own room. he falls asleep in his own bed when he does, usually without fuss. weve tried five different night lights, lullabies, reading to him book after book after book, rain sounds, singing him to sleep ourselves, giving him more melatonin when he wakes up, different pillows, two different mattresses, hes gone through two weighted blankets of different weights. snacks before bed. no snacks. water. juice. different temperatures. us in the room, us out of the room. rearranged the entire room twice. nothing works. even sleeping in our bed he still wakes up. hes got trouble talking, were doing speech therapy and occupational therapy and soon were going to start pcit, but covid closed the office so were waiting for that. we use sign language and can get him to say a few words usually, hes gotten much much better since we started it. hes hyperactive and never. stops. moving. no diagnosis on anything, weve been to countless doctors and all weve gotten is shrugged shoulders. weve got an appointment on monday with a psychologist weve been seeing, im not sure what shes going to do about it other than maybe tell us to keep doing what were doing. thats all i ever hear from doctors regarding my son. its pretty clear to me he has sensory issues, he freaks out if i turn on the air conditioner i have to calm him down. doesnt like being in crowds, hates having things on his hands like if ketchup gets on it, doesnt like loud noises . but im just so tired. its been months of this. and i dont know what to do. honestly it feels like i cant even last until monday if it means another two nights of this.	dreamweirddreams	/r/Mommit/comments/h86i9d/three_year_old_not_sleeping_at_all_any_advice/	2	1	0	1.0	1592050817.0
the hitting/throwing chronicles - needing advice.	okay so i know some of this is just a toddler being a toddler and we just have to do the best we can to get through it. however, im kind of at a loss. my son turned two in march, and is having issues with hitting/throwing things but the problem is that a lot of times, its out of nowhere. all the advice ive read talks about keeping your kid entertained because if they hit they likely have a need that isnt being met - i dont think thats the case in most of these situations. a lot of advice also talks about talking to them which we do, but i also feel like is pointless because i know he doesnt fully understand and he just pulls away or it causes him to lash out more. there are def times when hell be trying to do something on his tablet and if he cant get it to work hell turn around and hit me if im close by or just whip whatever hes holding. at least in these situations i understand why its happening. there are other times hell be playing just fine and out of nowhere hell just whip his toy across the room and hit one of the dogs. even if it doesnt hit one of the dogs, we obviously dont want to promote throwing his toys/tablet bc we take care of our things. again, i totally get that hes a toddler and things are occasionally going to be thrown. i just dont like when throwing one thing leads to throwing all the things. there are also times when its like hes deliberately throwing something at the dog/me/my husband to see our reaction - and these times puzzle me because hell be playing on his own/with one of us and be fine and then all of a sudden youre getting whacked in the head. we always make him stop for a second and calmly tell him we do not throw our toys or we do not hit, that hurts mommy and makes her sad or whatever but its like he just doesnt get it. im a sahm so all day is basically play with mom. im wondering if yall have any advice or ways you tried to deal with similar situations - i feel like most of what ive read is hard to apply with him because hes so young. hes not going to understand a time out or if i take something from him, and i feel like explaining we dont do this isnt getting far, so maybe some of yall have ideas.	trippapotamus	/r/Mommit/comments/h8lcow/the_hittingthrowing_chronicles_needing_advice/	5	2	0	1.0	1592101475.0

my daughter is the reason i finally embrace my curly messy hair for what it is!	i used to regularly straighten my hair with a flat iron because no matter what i did my hair appeared messy to me, i can't style it and there are always these small frizzy hairs sticking out everywhere. naturally my daughter has the craziest curls and now that she's 3 i've realized how much she can be influenced by my behavior so i decided i need to show her i love my hair if i want her to love hers. what would she think if mommy always straightened those curls? so the other day i jst thought screw it!! clip it half back and embrace the messy summer look. usually i would change my mind and feel insecure the second i walk out the door but not today i didn't! being the best me i can be for her has made me love myself better.. thank you baby girl on mobile, sry for formatting and whatnot edit wow thanks for the gold! i didn't expect this post to get any attention was just hoping it makes the slightest difference in someone's life but i have been reminded of the strong bond mamas can share even from behind a screen! lots of love to all of youu	zouzee	/r/Mommit/comments/h8y8wq/my_daughter_is_the_reason_i_finally_embrace_my/	50	437	0	1.0	1592156961.0

my ten year old son harassed girls in his class, and i have no idea what to do.	my son is ten years old and recently finished the fourth grade. i'm sure every parent would say this, but he's always been a very compassionate and kind kid. i've gotten emails from his teachers about how sweet and helpful he is to other students, and i've seen him go out of his way to include kids he sees by themselves. i know i'm biased, but he really does have a good heart. throughout his life, i've tried my very best to raise him socially conscious. my husband and i are both proud feminists, and we've been sure to give him female role-models and educate him about feminism and equity. i thought that he was very responsive to this, but i guess i was somewhat mistaken. my son was at an birthday party yesterday. late last night, my husband and i received messages from the parents of several girls in his class saying that he and his friends sent inappropriate text messages to their daughters during the party. your boobs look hot, i want to grind on you, you turn me on, etc etc. all of the things you would expect from a fourth grader trying to be sexual. i was deeply, deeply disturbed to hear this. this type of behavior is of course absolutely unacceptable even when self contained, but i'm also concerned about what this could spiral into in his future if it goes misaddressed. sure, it's a few text messages now , but who knows what kind of seeds could be planted if he gets the idea that this behavior is okay. the parents of the daughters involved are trying to get the school administration involved, which i would be in full support of, but we live in a very conservative area and frankly i would be surprised if the school gave anything more than boys will be boys and a slap on the wrist. so now here we are and i have no idea what to do. i want to punish him, of course, but i'm a strong believer in empathetic parenting as well - that is, making him understand why what he did was wrong rather than just getting angry. i want him to really, empathetically understand the kind of impact that this behavior can have, and not do it again in the future because he believes that it's wrong, not because he's afraid of getting punished. that only leads to a don't get caught next time mentality. right now, i'm planning on having him write personal apologies to the girls he sent messages to, but even that could feel like a chore to him rather than an opportunity for empathy if i don't approach it right. i just don't think i know what right looks like. i'm facing another dilemma here too his younger sister. she's only eight and she looks up to her brother with shining eyes. he feels the same way about her. he helps her out with her homework during his free time without ever being asked by my husband or me, he actively includes her in his games with his friends even though she's younger, he used to read stories to her at bedtime, etc. they have one of the best sibling relationships i've seen. i have no idea how to talk to her about this, if at all. typically, i let the punishment of one sibling be between us and i don't talk to the other about it - the humiliation is unnecessary and cruel. but i don't know if it would be socially irresponsible of me to not talk to her about it in some capacity, and i don't know if i could hide it from her even if i wanted to. whatever punishment we land on, it's almost certainly going to be something she notices. i am really, really at a loss here. i love my son to the world and beyond , and i really want to approach this with empathy. but i also know exactly how terrible this kind of behavior is, as someone who has been on the receiving end of it in the past. i want him to get it, but i don't know what more i can do than what i've already done throughout his upbringing. i'm posting this to multiple subs to get different perspectives. any advice is much, much appreciated. and don't be afraid to criticize me, either - i'm trying to be introspective with this, so if you think my tone or the way i'm approaching this is wrong, please let me know how i can do better. thank you.	momneedingadvice	/r/Mommit/comments/hcar4u/my_ten_year_old_son_harassed_girls_in_his_class/	8	8	0	1.0	1592607438.0

how to help child in misogynistic home	my cousin's 6-year old boy has been living with us since the pandemic started and will be with us through the end of the summer because his parents are both first responders in a big city -- a cop and a nurse -- and i was their only option to take care of their one child. they are very traditional -- both trump supporters, etc. from what their child says sometimes, i'm pretty sure there's some domestic violence, too. they are about ten hours away, so they won't see him until i drive him back in august. we are a house full of women. i am a single mom with two daughters and an adult step-daughter from a former relationship who is more like a sister and lives with us, too. when the boy arrived, he was very uncomfortable with the idea of having my daughters as playmates and was saying things like, boys don't play with girls and boys don't play dolls, etc. my step-daughter and i decided to have some fun and enlisted my girls' help and things sort of snowballed from there. i need some advice on how to make the rest of the child's time with us as positive as possible for him and for my daughters, too. he's in-between my daughters in size, so during our quarantine i eased him into wearing their clothes just by forgetting to do his laundry. i started with gender neutral t-shirts and shorts and then gradually replaced those with more girlie clothes by reassuring him that it didn't matter since he would just be at home. within a couple of weeks we had him comfortable wearing their princess outfits around the house, with a lot of positive reinforcement from all of us. from there he barely protested at all when i put out a pretty sundress for him one morning. my girls taught him how to sit on the toilet to pee, and i've let them all bathe together and play in the sprinkler together so they all understand boy anatomy is different from girl anatomy. my step-daughter has been in cosmetology school, and when it was time for him to have a haircut she surprised him with a cute bob with pink stripes. once it was time for us to be able to start going out of the house again, we gave him some pretty painted nails the day before our first outing. at first he seemed uncomfortable about going out in public in a dress, but i explained to him how pretty he looked and how a dress would look much better with his painted nails and pink hair, and he went along. he's been in girlie clothes every day since. my daughters love helping him get dressed every morning and taking him along to play with the other girls in the neighborhood. he's still at the age where nobody even notices he's a boy under the dress and nail polish and pink highlights. i didn't really have a plan when i started all of this, and in august, if the schools reopen, he'll be going back home to live with his parents. where do i go from here to make sure this is a positive experience? to be clear, i don't think he has any gender dysphoria or anything like that. he's just a six year old boy who has some messed up parents and is spending the summer having a very different experience.

advice on birthday party boundaries - please weigh in	for context, my daughter is 4, turning 5 soon, and she wanted a birthday party with her 4 closest preschool friends before they all go off to separate elementary schools for kindergarten in a few months. in the past, we have had all of our neighbors and couple friends and their kids over, but this year she has requested just a small party. these girls have all grown up together at the same preschool, and she wants a backyard tea party with her little besties. a text invite went to all 4 moms and one immediately responded and said they could not come, as they were camping. my husband and i rejoiced because we do not particularly get along with this girl or her family, the mother in particular. i find she does not recognize or respect a lot of social cues and boundaries, continuously compares the girls and points out how her daughter/family is better, etc. in addition, she keeps trying to push our girls together, and though they have known each other for a long time, i can see in their interactions that the two of them are not particularly close. tea party place settings and party favors were all purchased after head count was established, to make sure theyd arrive in time. said mother just sent me a message saying they rearranged their plans, and now can attend. while cringing, i went ahead and ordered another place setting and party favor, as i hadnt included her once she declined. but heres what im getting caught up on the girl who is now coming last minute has an older sister that is 3 years older, and i believe she will inevitably show up. none of the other invited guests have older kids, only infant siblings so of course i expect those families to arrive and have them in tow. they will not require much for me to prepare ahead of time, so their presence/absence does not matter. however, if the older sister shows up, there will be no one for her to play with, i do not plan to have favors for her, and i mainly dont want her to take over a party for preschoolers. she isnt particularly nice, even to her sister, which i have witnessed in plenty of other get togethers with these families. i just dont see it going well. should i make it clear to the mother ahead of time that her older daughter is not invited? view poll	miss_clarabell	/r/Mommit/comments/hf5nua/advice_on_birthday_party_boundaries_please_weigh/	14	3	0	0.72	1593020966.0
7yo won't leave kittens alone. need help.	i have a 7yo and 4yo. we have a pair of ancient cats, and we adopted a litter of 3 kittens this last month as we caught them from their feral mama. since we took in the kittens, we've seen a huge regression in 7yo's behavior. 4yo is riding the changes no problem. 7yo loves cats. absolutely loves them. he routinely broke bedtime rules to go snuggle with our older cats even before this happened. with the kittens, he's lost his mind. 9/10 times, if i look for my 7yo, he's stalking the kittens or carrying them around. we have talked it out, we've roleplayed, we've encouraged him to think about how the kittens would feel, we've explained that he'll get more chances to snuggle them if he does not push them into snuggling now, we've done discipline . nothing works to discourage him, and he's taken to acting out in all the ways, including things like refusing to wear his mask properly at a dental appt the other day. to be clear, he was a perfect patient for working with the staff. he just ignored or did the opposite of every instruction that i gave him. now, is he causing harm by constantly chasing down the kittens? not overly much, except that he's encouraging them to play rough with him, and those kittens teeth and claws are going to become really painful in a few months as they grow. we also have one kitten who's taking longer to adjust than her sisters, and we absolutely do not want him to cause delays in her adjustment. we already missed the best window for domesticating her . so, i'm not sure what to do. we're not getting rid of kittens or kids. our home is set-up in a way that we could confine the kittens to my husband's office while the kids stay outside it, and maybe that's what i'll end up doing, but it introduces hardship for our elderly cats, and the kittens definitely prefer to play in the living room than our bedroom--more sprinting space. any thoughts? things i missed? if it's relevant, 7yo does have both adhd and high-functioning autism. he does get counseling and medication, and i do plan to bring this up with his therapist. i'm just really at my wits end. i can't get anything done when i'm constantly redirecting him from the kittens, and it's really hurting my relationship with both my sons for me to constantly be on 7yo about the kittens.

does anyone else feel like they do better alone with their lo?	my lo is around a year old. my husband had to run his mum to an airport across the country to get her home a few weeks ago. it was just lo and i for around two days. i managed to cook her food, care for her, and clean up the kitchen along with pumping every 6 hours or so. it was tiring as i had to plan my bathroom breaks and meals, but i managed to make it through. right now, my husband has work from home. it feels like i get a lot less done with him at home than i did when he went into the office and i'm not sure why. his trip with his mum made me realize this. right before covid, i started getting to a point where i would have dinner and next day's lunch for all three of us made in the evening along with laundry and dishes done. now, i'm lucky if i can manage to cook. and it doesn't help that my husband doesn't want me to be tired, so he never wants me to do chores or cook. he'd rather i just make ready made for us, and cereal/gerber tubs for lo. lo is also teething and just several handfuls in general, which makes husband irritable by end of day, so i'm doing everything i can to make sure he's not bothered during the work day and that he doesn't have to watch her much after work so he can work in the garage to decompress from work, and she doesn't bother his sleep. i'm exhausted all the time and struggling to get a grip on everything. i'm only a stay at home mom, so i'm not even juggling a job with lo, but it feels like i have too much to do.	lifeIsHardB4TheFall	/r/Mommit/comments/hmp8gc/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_do_better_alone/	4	4	0	1.0	1594103103.0

any ideas on keeping my daughter's hair out of her face?	i have a one year old whose hair falls on top of her forehead and actually goes down to her nose. we are having the worst heat wave and she will not let me keep her hair up! she is so sweaty all day that you can literally wring her hair out. problem is that she pulls everything out immediately. hairclips, hair ties, and headbands. i can keep her hair up for about 30 mins max if i put in a hairclip, let her pull it out, then put the hair tie in while she plays with the clip. i'm so frustrated! does anyone have any ideas? i've thought about getting hair jel or something to slick it back but have never used hair products so i'm not sure if that would work or if it's safe. any ideas appreciated!		/r/Mommit/comments/hntqev/any_ideas_on_keeping_my_daughters_hair_out_of_her/	7	2	0	1.0	1594257137.0

need advice juggling activities with my kids	i have a 6yo son and a 2yo daughter. were located in nyc. my husband and i have been working from home since the pandemic started. luckily i havent been that busy so ive been taking care of the kids more. my husbands job requires him to have numerous zoom meetings throughout the day so hes usually not around often to help. this isnt the issue though as its really my 2yo. i would love to do some activities with my son so hes not just watching his ipad all day but my 2yo makes it impossible. shes at the age where she wants to be involved in everything her brother does and has to literally sit on top of him if hes trying to do something or grab things out of his hand. i try and redirect her to other activities but she wont leave her brother alone. my sister got them kiwi box subscriptions but shell throw her craft on the ground and try and literally destroy whatever activity hes working on. ive been trying to find activities they can both do together but these are getting boring for them and im running out of ideas. lots of fighting and screaming. its brutally hot and humid out and not much to do in our urban area. im still wary of the playgrounds that just reopened since our neighborhood was one of the hardest hit when we were at the peak of the pandemic. taking them both outside alone is also difficult due to her age . i feel super bad for my 6yo bc we just cant do the activities he wants without her not invading his space. our apartment is super small too so were just all in the living room trying to survive. we have no yard or common area. there are times my 2yo will independently play with her toys but the minute she sees me doing an activity with my son she will run and try and sit on top of him in the chair and grab whatever it is. its exhausting. ive tried the one on one time with her before trying to engage an activity with my son but it doesnt work. right now my son is trying to play a game on his ipad at the dining table after a failed attempt at a dual playdoh session and shes literally climbing his chair so she can touch his ipad. hes so frustrated and i cant blame him. help!!!	jlim311	/r/Mommit/comments/ho420z/need_advice_juggling_activities_with_my_kids/	2	2	0	1.0	1594304985.0
help needed how to foster independence in 5 year-old?!?!	these covid times are so trying and i know my kiddo is doing his best to be independent but i need to foster in him to be even more independent. and i don't know where to start. for context my husband and i are lucky enough to have jobs that allow us to work from home. unfortunately, we're on calls. all. day. long. it sucks for the kid. we also have a 9-month-old and so with that one i can put him down for naps. however, my 5yo cannot stand being by himself for a few moments. meltdown tears, shouting ... etc. so if dad is on a call and i'm trying to put baby down for a nap in between one of my calls, the 5yo is beside himself. maybe i'm asking too much and he's stressed because he no longer has his routine, his friends, his school ... etc. but then again, i ask him to wash his hands because he had a sticky snack and he can't walk in to the other room where the bathroom is without him negotiating or pleading that i come with him. really?!? so, tell me please, am i off base and asking too much or are there resources that you've found to be helpful to encourage your kiddo to be more independent? edit typo.	mschulzinger	/r/Mommit/comments/ho87ek/help_needed_how_to_foster_independence_in_5/	8	2	0	0.75	1594318686.0

can't find what i'm looking for - something to baby proof a screen window	hoping somebody has a good idea for me or knows of a product made for this my one year old has only one window in her room. we don't have central air and it's getting close to 100 degrees everyday so i have to keep her window open. the window is very close to the bottom of the floor, she can stand up and push on the screen. i can't find anything to make sure that she can't push the screen out and fall. it wasn't a problem before because her changing table blocked it. we just replaced that with a dresser that we couldn't secure there without it being a fire hazard since you wouldn't be able to escape out of the window. if anyone has suggestions or knows of a product for this i will be so so thankful!!		/r/Mommit/comments/hq0lx9/cant_find_what_im_looking_for_something_to_baby/	3	2	0	1.0	1594582946.0
 my husband confronted his mother about not following our instructions when babysitting, she accused me of ppd rather than doing anything wrong	i guess i'm just hoping others have been through similar and have been able to come to an understanding and may have some advice. tldr at bottom. my mil watched our 3 month old daughter the other day and, without asking, invited a large group of cousins over to hang out with her. these people traveled here from a high risk covid area. had she asked, i absolutely would have said no due to the risk. on top of that, these cousins hadn't met her yet, so we missed them meeting our first born. when i found out she had done this, i simply packed up quickly, took baby and left, came home to my husband, crying the whole time, and explained the situation. the vast majority of my immediate family hasn't met my daughter because i don't want to risk it. but she, without my permission, invited extended family without us there and put my baby at risk . after many many accounts of mil not following our instructions my husband decided this was the last straw and confronted his mother about it. he was nice, but firm. but she absolutely took offense from it. this, was her text back. i'm obviously very hurt by all of this. i've been a mother for 30 years and i'm being told i don't know what i'm doing? when i watch , she is completely taken care of, safe, loved and played with. i'm worried about . these worries and the anxiety she is going through us a scary side of postpartum. no one accused her of not knowing what she's doing, we just let her know that we don't appreciate our instructions not being following and the fact that she put our child at risk of covid. and instead of simply saying she would try harder to follow our instructions and apologizing for the risk she put baby in, she decided that i have ppd because why else would i be worried about my baby with a week immune system getting an extremely contagious disease??? i mean... seriously? i am absolutely positively i don't have ppd. and, there's nothing wrong with having it, but she would rather assume i have a mental disorder then take responsibility for her actions. are my husband and i somehow in the wrong here? what can we do to reach a mutual understanding here? we are moving soon and don't want to leave under these circumstances. tldr mil put our 3 month old at risk for corona virus and would rather accuse me of having ppd because i'm too worried then recognize she did something wrong or even agree not to do it again. edit for clarity. edit 2 so now she's claiming that she didn't invite cousins over, they showed up unannounced. fine. sorry i accused you of inviting them. but you still shouldn't have let them in with an infant in your home. right?	throwmetoflames	/r/Mommit/comments/hq97ft/vent_my_husband_confronted_his_mother_about_not/	9	13	0	1.0	1594616495.0
how to respond to mom?	so i've been separated from my parents since march because of covid. we're finally going to get to go there soon and i'll be staying there. it's over the border in canada so we'll be doing the mandatory self-quarantine when we arrive. i reminded my parents when we arrive to refrain from hugs and kisses and my mom scrunched her face and said it's been so long. i'm getting at least 1 from each of you to which i said no and i wasn't ok with that. she made a face like i was being ridiculous and continued to say i'm getting just 1 , though if you get 1, might as well get 382974. any advice on the best way to verbalize to her that this is my choice not hers? i don't have much of a choice that i need to be going there for some doctors appointments but i'm uncomfortable with this contact that she's insisting on	ThanksForStoppingBy	/r/Mommit/comments/hqngwb/how_to_respond_to_mom/	8	3	0	0.8	1594673326.0

wwyd when the parent of the bad influence child is your friend	my friend emily has a daughter just a couple weeks older than my son, they're both 2.5 years old. we've been friends for years, so how awesome is it that we have children so close in age? well, it sucks. i come home from every weekly play date with a headache and a confused irritable child that no longer feels like my sweet boy. emily disciplines her child completely differently than i do mine. my son has watched her yell at, give in to, and spank her child every time we get together. i rarely raise my voice, do not give in to whininess, and never spank. her daughter will scream, hit her mother , and then run away. of course, all of this seems enticing to my child now that he sees his friend doing it. emily's child will demand a cell phone, and after throwing a huge tantrum full of hitting and screaming, emily will give her a phone, leaving my child without a friend. i become the bad parent because i don't allow him to play with my phone, hit, run away, etc. he's far more difficult at home for the following day or two as a result. and unfortunately, emily's child has been like this since she could crawl, so i can't chalk it up to just being a phase. it gets awkward and exhausting really fast. emily's daughter will run away out of sight at the store, and then i'm telling my child, i can't let you run away, and he's upset as to why he can't have the same fun his friend is having. i avoid having playdates at our house because her daughter has broken several toys and even the swing i used for my second child . i don't want emily to feel like a bad parent, but it's hard to have playdates with a child that is being parented in a completely different way. i feel like if my son was older, we could have discussions about why i parent him differently than emily parents her daughter, but he's a toddler. even then though, i'm not sure i want him around a child that yells and hits her mother and a mother that spanks her child constantly. i don't want to lose the friendship with the mother, nor do i want to insult her parenting, but it is causing us so much added stress. covid-19 has kept us apart lately , but i'm dreading when we start playdates back up again. what would you do? tl;dr my friend's 2.5yo is a negative influence on my 2.5yo so i want to dramatically cut back on playdates, but i don't want to insult my friend's parenting or ruin our pre-kids friendship.

need advice!	i have a 3 month old little girl, and she is literally the perfect baby. we're starting to run into a little trouble with sleep though. she doesn't nap much during the day. she consistently wakes up at 6-6 30am, which is fine that's no problem. i always give her a night time bath at 5-5 30pm so she can be asleep by 6-6 30pm. that usually works but she fights me pretty hard to go to bed, i rock her . i bought this infantino fox sleepy time soother thing, and it worked! she fell asleep laying in her crib all on her own last night and was down by 6 30pm. perfect. but, in the last week or two she went from sleeping through the night or mostly through the night and having no problems getting back to bed . now she's waking up at 11pm and eating and then fights to go back to sleep. at that point i can usually get her back to sleep within a half hour. not too bad. after that 11pm waking and feeding she'll wake up anywhere from 2 30-3am and won't go back to bed and it takes me an hour to an hour and half to get her back to sleep or else she's just crying. i've tried letting her cry it out but that's just not for me, i can't leave my baby to cry and be upset by herself. my husband wakes up at 3 20am and leaves for his 4am shift by 3 45am. he is very quiet, never turns any lights on and doesn't seem to bother the baby. so i don't think that's the issue. but, i am losing so much sleep and i am going crazy. i just need some advice, i'm trying to stick to a schedule. everything is really fine up until the 11pm and 2 30-3am wakings. i've literally found myself sobbing while trying to rock her to sleep, i'm at a loss and i'm losing my mind. i literally have gotten to where i'm so drained from this happening every night that i want to cry all day long. i am a stay at home mom right now. so sorry for the long post, but like i said, i need help/advice. thank you so much for any responses!! 	dailynnball	/r/Mommit/comments/hu0ged/need_advice/	4	2	0	1.0	1595165158.0

i need help!	my 5yo daughter is so smart, talented, and beautiful! she has always been very vocal and very spirited and hard headed! which that is something that i love about her. she is the baby of 4 and she is rotten! but... she has the smartest mouth ive ever seen on a human being! i tell her to do something its a smart comment or and eye roll. i dont know what to do! i put her in the corner, ground her from her favorite things. at the time she appears to be sorry but as soon as the punishment is over she starts again. whenever i try to just sit her down and talk to her about it she starts saying that nobody in the family lives her, she doesn't want to be apart of this family anymore and a new development is she has went so far as to smack herself in the face and call herself a dumby when she got into trouble. im sooooo confused about what avenue to take next. she knows her expectations and she knows the house rules and is 100% capable of following them. i'm also wondering if it has something to do with possibly being home together for literally 5 months straight because of covid. im not saying thats all of it because she has always been a smart mouth little girls but the hitting herself and calling herself names is something new. any suggestions are welcomed!	teetawn1992	/r/Mommit/comments/hwv222/i_need_help/	3	2	0	1.0	1595564150.0
can someone explain why people give unsolicited advice?	i love being a mom but for some reason, when i'm a mom, the unsolicited advice is constantly happening. usually from people who are pretty overbearing and who does not like to take no for an answer. because these are my in laws and i would like to continue a relationship with them, does anyone know why people are like this, psychologically etc? i guess i'm trying to not get to me but it does and i feel like i'm not doing things right just because they have raised kids before me.	finstafoodlab	/r/Mommit/comments/hwx9az/can_someone_explain_why_people_give_unsolicited/	2	8	0	0.84	1595574483.0

psa what not to say to another mom/pregnant friend	psa and i say this in the most loving way possible, as i know most people have the best intentions the absolute worst thing you can say to a pregnant woman or mom is any form of just you wait... whether that be, oh you think this part is hard, just wait til the baby is here! or just wait until you're in your third trimester, that's when it'll get really hard or just you wait...when that baby finally arrives you won't remember any of the bad stuff! or just you wait until that baby arrives and you never sleep again. this is the literal worst thing to say. it is not comforting. it doesnt make them feel better. it just makes them feel like what they are going through and their feelings are unjustified, and that there will always be something worse so how theyre feeling right now doesnt matter. so unless you are belting the opening number of hamilton, just you waaaaaaaait! then please just don't say these words to any pregnant woman in any way, shape, or form. thanks in advance <3	depot3	/r/Mommit/comments/i00a0l/psa_what_not_to_say_to_another_mompregnant_friend/	156	502	0	0.97	1596027612.0

feet first - how the hell do i get my son to stop face diving off everything!?	my son is 11 months. since he's been able to roll we've been urging him to roll over and slide down from the couch. when he started crawling we showed him every time how to turn sideways and go feet first. in frustration we decided maybe just let him face plant a few times, but he was totally fine with that as a means to descend. we went back to telling him feet first and when he didn't change course we'd assist him going feet first. a month ago he had a severe facial injury not related to getting or climbing down, but since then he's less willing to lead with his face, so he just sat at the top of the stair and whined for us to help. this last week he started walking, and the last few days learned to stand on his own. now he seems to think the best way to get down is to stand and walk off the edge, so that's awful. when we turn him and back him down stairs, he just frantically scrambles back up them, then either whines for help or tries to stand again. the few times he does it by accident, basically falling off something with his feet down, we praise him like crazy. does anyone have any other tricks to help teach him? he's generally a quick learner and we only have to show him things a few times, but obviously what we're doing isn't working.

teething and naps. advice please!!!	my 6 mo has two swollen lower central incisors. . one started cutting yesterday and the other will be soon to follow. now my los naps have always been short. three 45 minute naps with 12 hours a night. so i wasnt complaining too much. but since hes been teething, he started early waking at 5 am, and taking 3 naps that are only a half hour long and 10 hour nights. i know thats still a blessing compared to what a lot of moms have to deal with, but he is always yawning and rubbing his eyes and is so tired. i want to give him tylenol for his naps but im not sure if it has any affect really. i tried for one naps yesterday and he still only slept for 45 minutes. i feed him a before he sleeps making sure that he doesnt close his eyes to make sure that he has a full tummy and doesnt wake up out of hunger. i follow his sleep cues and give him appropriate wake times. idk what else to do really.	rednatnats	/r/Mommit/comments/i2b6p9/teething_and_naps_advice_please/	3	2	0	1.0	1596370920.0

how to get baby off of bottles?	my lo is around 13 months. i've had to do exclusive pumping due to a latching issue. because of that, she's drank from a bottle the entire time. we introduced sippy cups around 8 months. she doesn't care for them. she's a very lazy feeder - waits for the milk to pour into her mouth, barely suckles, etc - so i thought she'd love sippy cups. nope. only wants the bottle. she'll play with the sippy cups, but no matter what we put in them - water, milk, juice, even sugar water - she takes a sip or two, then dumps it on the floor. does anyone have any tips for getting a baby off the bottle?	korenestis	/r/Mommit/comments/i3e694/how_to_get_baby_off_of_bottles/	2	3	0	1.0	1596522203.0

moms, what do i do?	my son developed brachycephaly and no matter what we've done, it has not corrected itself. i took him to his headscan today and they said in three weeks he will need a helmet to correct it since he cannot do it himself and even though i do everything right and what the doctors tell me to do, we have to do this. found out his insurance won't cover a penny of it and we have to pay close to three grand out of pocket in three weeks. i just now went back to work and don't make that in three months, let alone three weeks. my bank account doesn't even have a hundred dollars in it. my family can't help out because they don't have the funds either. i made a gofundme but i don't know what else to do. i have nothing i can sell to relatively get even half. i'm so stressed out and i feel helpless and like a terrible mother who can't help her son. i just don't know what to do.. positive update may have found a doctor that is more reasonable with their prices and i'll find out monday! some stress has been relieved and i'm grateful for the people who have sent me their prayers and condolences and wishful thinking.

advice on announcing pregnancy to a friend with difficulties ttc	i had my first babe back in 2019 and my other 2 friends started trying a few months after that. one friend conceived right away and has recently given birth. the other friend hasn't had any luck and has said how she's feeling really discouraged because of it. i'm currently pregnant and i'm excited to tell them, but i don't want this to make my friend feel worse. i think mentally she felt it was her turn and though she won't be unhappy or mad at me by any means, i'm worried it will make her feel more discouraged because 2 of us have had it so easy compared to her. any advice what i could say or do when i see them?

how do you find time to take care of your body?	my second baby is six months old and that baby weight really decided to stay this time. with my first i came out of pregnancy way smaller than i went into it . with my second that did not happen. i had hoped breastfeeding would make it go away but it didnt. i just feel like i literally do not have the time to diet/exercise. i cook for my husband grandparents every night and theyre old and picky, i have a two year old and a six month old so i damn sure dont have time to cook two different meals, i was getting up at night to workout but i already have to get up to clean so staying up that late is exhausting. we go for walks several times a week. but i just feel gross. my body is way different after my second baby. none of my jeans fit. my stomach is really fat. my face is chubby. i want to feel better but i dont know what to do with no extra time. what do you guys do to get healthier with a busy mom life?	yakkay_mom	/r/Mommit/comments/ia21wt/how_do_you_find_time_to_take_care_of_your_body/	10	3	0	0.81	1597470107.0

planning for first baby advice	hi everyone! so covid has kind of thrown off a bit of everyones timeline and i was hoping to get some advice and opinions here. my husband and i have been set on trying for a baby at the beginning of 2021 for a while. the timing just works for us. that being said, my best friend was supposed to get married this october and i am the maid of honor. covid has caused the wedding to be postponed until next october... obviously there are a lot of factors , but hypothetically, if everything goes well, i could be pregnant during this wedding. my question is this how heavily pregnant is too pregnant to be involved to the extent a maid of honor is usually expected to be? ive already come to terms with the fact that i cannot drink/party , but theres also the risk of traveling when i could pop. i barely even know what im asking. all i know is this wedding means a lot to me and i dont want to make anything about me during that week prior. its my best friends time and he deserves it, especially after rescheduling. anyone have any planning advice? or just thoughts in general?	hbrooke12	/r/Mommit/comments/icv14s/planning_for_first_baby_advice/	3	1	0	1.0	1597866859.0

any tips on keeping an 8 month old content while i attend college online?	hello, this is my first post. i welcome and appreciate any advice you may have. my husband and i are both currently enrolled in university and will be taking classes this fall online. we both have the same major so we are able to take the same classes, which helps a lot when it comes to buying textbooks! we have an 8 month old little boy who is likely days away from walking. our living room is set up so that we can put him on the floor with toys and he is safe. its got foam floors and a gate so he cant get into anything. well be sitting out there with him while we do our schoolwork, trying to keep our laptops out of his reach. i was just wondering if anyone has any ideas on how we can encourage independent play while we work. realistically, well most likely end up taking turns using the computers, but its tough because my son has pretty bad separation anxiety specifically with me so sometimes hes content with his father and sometimes im the only thing he wants. this makes taking turns more difficult. obviously, he wont be 8 months the whole semester, so i suppose im looking for advice for independent play for 8-12 months. hes typically fairly good at playing on his own but only for short amounts of time and i dont want him to get bored with his toys if thats all he has access to. we try to keep him away from screens completely, but im nervous that with school we might fall into allowing it more easily, which has prompted this post. thank you in advance!

16yo f looking for a place to stay; i don't have too much money, but i can give what i have and get a part-time job if needed.	sorry to ask on family subs, but i'm a little wary of asking non-families for help considering my age and gender. my dad has always had anger problems. hes openly hostile to people he doesnt know, he enjoys guilt tripping and getting dirt on people, and he has vaguely threatened me in the past. i dont want to get them in trouble so im hesitant to report him to someone, but i know they wont give me permission to live anywhere else. my mom is sort of his enabler and in denial about how dangerous he is. im so afraid hes gonna snap, especially now that were constantly around each other. i can never tell what mood hes in or if hes going to lash out. hes screamed and yelled, but never hit me before, but im scared he might. hes got some chronic pain so hes been lashing out more often. where can i go? hes much stronger than i am and i dont have any weapons of self-defense. i want to leave so badly, where can i go? is there a place to find a really cheap room to rent? i only have 1.5k in cash and i need to be able to live somewhere for my junior and senior year of high school. does anyone here know of someone willing to rent out a spare bedroom or basement or anything? sorry to intrude, i know its not much of an offer; i am 16 so i can get a job outside of school if that helps.

covid & family expectations - need advice	wedding in the family coming up and they will not be social distancing and we are supposed to attend with our toddler. its only 25 people, but none of them are in our household or bubble . we have gotten together with some of the people attending a few times in the pandemic and they have not respected our physical distancing boundaries and made comments. people are coming from out of town, staying with in laws, food is going to be served buffet style, drinks grab your own. all of this is against recommendations for our area. it will be outside but you are still not supposed to get close to people that dont live in your household. weve already said we are going because faaaamily but id rather piss people off than get covid? i dont want to end up being that party on the news? our daughter is supposed to fiiiinally start daycare the next week and theres been no outbreaks at her centre. i go for plenty of walks with her where we see lots of people and she is great when i say give people space, slows down her running, stops beside me, and waves at them or says hi. i just dont know how it will be with people she knows who i know will be shamelessly trying to entice her to come over to them. is it completely terrible if i go and wear a mask the whole time? is it more rude to attend and not drink or eat than it is to not go? our daughter is under 2 and cant wear a mask. she is supposed to go down the aisle with me but should i just wear her in a backpack so no one touches her?? anyone have any advice or personal experience with similar family expectations/events during this time?	kalsarikanni	/r/Mommit/comments/iea2ae/covid_family_expectations_need_advice/	4	5	0	1.0	1598061376.0

how do you justify bringing a child into this world?	this question requires a little backstory my husband and i had our daughter 3 years ago. after she was born, we decided that we dont want to bring any more kids into this world given the crazy state of it . we decided to become foster parents because we knew we werent done having little kiddos in our house. fast forward to a little over a month ago, i am getting this unshakeable urge to have another kid. i dont know what it is, but i sat with it before even bringing it up to my husband for weeks. i cant fight the feeling. my vision for my family has changed to include another kiddo and i cant help it. my husband does not want another kid. in fact, when i brought it up, his response was, ive been thinking more and more about that vasectomy. he really is frustrated by the state of our world and doesnt want to bring even more people into it when its such a mess. i do still share this sentiment, but i think my need for another kid is pushing that feeling to the back burner. we have brought this up in therapy and he suggested that we spend the next two weeks envisioning a life for ourselves with and without another baby. weve been doing that, but my husband is pretty steadfast in his belief. i do respect his decision and i would never force him to have another child, but my question is, how do i justify having another kiddo when i have these feelings about the world?	maianotmia	/r/Mommit/comments/iiiaee/how_do_you_justify_bringing_a_child_into_this/	12	1	0	0.56	1598658400.0

i just need some advice or guidance or even just reassurance	i don't know if this is allowed but i don't know where else to turn. my son is a little over a year old, he's becoming increasingly violent but only towards me, tonight getting him to sleep involved headbutting, kicking, hitting, hair pulling, pinching, biting and he even jumped onto my stomach. he is only this violent towards me, he will occasionally bite or hit his dad but usually he's only violent with me. somethings about our parenting style, we don't hit or spank him we rarely raise our voices and we explain why we say no. somethings about my son, he does not talk he often bangs his head on the wall or doors when he's told no, he can become violent out of seemingly nowhere... don't get me wrong though, he can be very sweet and kind and he loves to give hugs and kisses and he's very affectionate. i just need some guidance, we were looking into play therapy and a few other options, but due to lockdown all of that is on hold, i don't know how much longer i can handle it. timeouts don't work and im very very against spanking due to the ptsd it caused me, but i feel like im running out of options. sometimes all i can do is wrap him in a blanket and keep his head still until he calms down, but as soon as i let go he starts right back up.

any advice/ tips welcomed and appreciated	a little back story- im in the process of adopting my niece, shes two weeks shy of being 2 months old. both parents werent really taking care of her or loving her properly, it was borderline negligence. i lived very freely and comfortably. ive had her for almost two weeks straight and before then i had her for almost a week before she went back with her parents. i didnt expect it to be easy, i thought long and hard about this as it is a lifetime commitment and somebodys life i cannot play with. with that being said, i dove in head first. shes pretty much taken up all of our space haha. theres baby stuff all over, i dont wanna seem dramatic or anything but the way i see and feel about this is she bonded with me the first time i had her. i felt this connection so strong. all the comfort i have her, i felt that. now shes with me full time and i dont know if its separation anxiety or what, but i cant step out of the room without her freaking out. if i am out of sight or she cant hear me she tends to throw a fit. even when her actual parents hold her. im trying not to get her in the habit of being carried but sometimes she will not sleep unless her head is rested on my chest. shes constantly between wanting to be swaddled and wanting to be free and stretched out. two weeks ago i was freelancing, painting, going out and sleeping more than 4 hours a night. now im looking for something more remote or something that will actually be a good stepping stone to get a career started so that i can be the best version of myself for her. i am beyond exhausted, frustrated and just needing some sort of advice to this whole mommy thing. ive raised my 3 brothers and grew up watching children in my family. i babysit a lot too. im very in touch with my motherly nurturing side but thats not enough. i make sure i do everything in my power to make sure shes comfortable. fresh warm bottles, clean linens, clean area, comfy and clean clothes, make sure to burp her, warm baths followed by baby massages, i brush her hair softly even when were just lounging, i hold her when shes fussy, i talk to her, i sing to her and i overall just try to keep her happy. but sometimes i swear she cries just to cry. i have no complaints or regrets when it comes to what i am doing. she makes me so happy and i am willing to do everything and anything i have to go ensure a good life for her. i just need some pointers. im so tired, i cant ever eat because she cant be away from me. so i have left overs from every meal. i havent showered in a week, i have a constant headache and i just wanna be great.	lauratheloraxx	/r/Mommit/comments/ilanu3/any_advice_tips_welcomed_and_appreciated/	17	9	0	0.86	1599065915.0

how did you know your baby is ready for 1 nap ?	hello, my son is 11 months and has been on a 2 nap schedule since he was 6-7 months. ive struggled with an early bed time with him since the dawn of time. usually hes asleep 9-10pm. 9 most of the time but 10 sometimes if i dont cut his naps short. i feel if i change him to one nap itll help with earlier bed time. however, yesterday he refused his morning nap on time and was awake 830-1215. slept 1215-145 at my friends house. on our way home i was hopeful hed take a cat nap in the car ride back to help him make it to 8. he didnt. i put him down at 7pm. he woke up around 8 crying i cuddled him he fell asleep. he was tossing and turning til around 9. then he woke up and refused to go back to sleep. took a poop at 930. i tried everything after that but he stayed up for another hour. i know hes not used to such early bed time so it would take a bit to get him on a new schedule. but how do i know if hes really ready? anyone else switch to 1 nap before 12 months ? what was your experience ? tia !!!	irena92	/r/Mommit/comments/ilqeoq/how_did_you_know_your_baby_is_ready_for_1_nap/	10	1	0	1.0	1599126302.0

how to know if baby dropped/labor is gonna begin?	hello mommies! this is a bit if a weird question, but how do you know if baby is engaged/has dropped? i'm currently 39 weeks with my second. i don't really have experience with just waiting for labor to start because i had to be induced for my first due to high blood pressure. i've been feeling a bit of pressure kind of close to my leg i guess semi in my pelvic area, but more close to my leg joint. i've also been getting braxton hicks pretty much everyday though its not painful, just slightly uncomfortable. for the first time today, a couple was actually a bit more uncomfortable. any help/advice is much appreciated!	whimsical_nonsense	/r/Mommit/comments/iqo4g7/how_to_know_if_baby_droppedlabor_is_gonna_begin/	5	1	0	1.0	1599821024.0

i'm a new mum, but i know how to be one 	i just wanted to get it off my chest - i can't stand my sister in law. she's got three kids and thinks that because she's done it three times, she knows best. she's given me unsolicited advice at every stage , and bear in mind that i've barely seen her due to my baby being born under covid restrictions. she told me not to pump because the baby would only want the bottle and your milk will dry up . she didn't bother to ask me why i was pumping to let my husband give the baby a bottle in case we needed to leave the baby with dad. she told me not to bathe the baby for a month. she told me that introducing any food other than breast milk before 6 months will give the baby all sorts of ailments . the baby is 5 months and 2 weeks and was born 2 weeks late. if i complain to my husband or mil i just get told that she means well . ugh! rant over, thanks for reading this far...

nanny red flags...what would you do?	single working mom here. i have a pretty great nanny. i admit i'm very picky when it comes to who watches my son while i work from home. he's comfortable with her and she has a great maternal instinct that was always lacking in other nannies i interviewed and had a trial run with. that being said, it's been 3ish months and there are some red flags -she's a conservative christian with a missionary background, and i'm not christian, and there have been times where i see her giving my son pamphlets and little booklets from her purse to play with when they go outside -she has tried to engage a guest that was staying with me and given her christian pamphlets as well despite my guest telling her she's not interested -she eats my home cooked food regularly without asking me beforehand -not really a red flag but super annoying she keeps flipping the toilet roll in the bathroom to roll the opposite way than how i have it. every single day. -when my son breaks something, she tells me it didn't happen under her watch even though it clearly did -she doesn't drive so her transportation reliability has been iffy and i'm finding myself catering my work hours to her schedule more and more -she replies only on facebook messenger and doesn't really call or text so i have to juggle communicating with her by having my fb open bc i don't have messenger installed in my phone -her son is going to a very crowded school and i'm nervous about covid exposure bc it seems like while she initially told me she takes precautions, she doesn't seem to really care -i prefer to pay her with direct deposit but have to cater to her preferred payment method via check which can be annoying bc i never know when she's going to cash it and deduct the money from my account am i being too sensitive? what would yall do? like i said she's great with my kiddo and i'm having a really hard time finding a nanny i trust nowadays. not sure how to talk to her without offending her. side note how do you guys pay your nannies? she says she prefers i do it all with a professional payroll service that i have to pay for where i have to pay for all the taxes in addition to her salary. i've never done it this way before but it's getting really pricey with taxes and her salary.	anonyfaceyface	/r/Mommit/comments/itgzf4/nanny_red_flagswhat_would_you_do/	12	3	0	1.0	1600201726.0

i need help or advice please. i feel like i am failing.	i am so tired. it is 11pm as i type this. i got my daughter to bed around 8.30 and she fell asleep so easily, i was so happy. i laid in bed and tried to fall asleep, it is hard to get comfy as i am 21 weeks pregnant. i fell asleep around 10.30 and she woke up at 10.40 screeching. i gave her her paci and tried patting her back and she just kept pulling the paci out to scream. i left the room to use the bathroom, but hoping she would go back to sleep, but she just screamed to the point of her voice breaking. i went back in and turned on thunderstorm noises we high normally help, tried patting her back, rocking her, just holding her. she was only content to lay on my lap & watch the light i turned on when i try to put her down she goes right back to screaming. when she wakes up like this sometimes she won't go back to sleep until around 5am no matter what i try. but she still gets up by 10am and is up all day very active. we moved to this apartment in july, she hasn't slept a full night since then. before the move she slept all night from a few months old and i really considered myself lucky. my husband works 12 hour night shifts and we have literally no family to help us. i have considered taking her to her doctor to rule out any possible medical issues but my husband thinks it won't do any good. i have no idea. we have a decent routine, at bedtime she gets a nice bath & gets to play in the tub, gets on her night diaper / outfit, lotion, and then a bottle. i normally try to hold her and just cuddle her until she gets tired enough to be put in her crib, but lately she has fought everything & kicks me so much right in the stomach that i just sit her in her crib and leave the room while if my husband puts her to sleep he cuddles her in the bed and lets her fall asleep then puts her in the crib. it is 50/50 on if she actually stays asleep for either way. throughout the day she eats & plays and her naps really vary. they are between 30 minutes and 3 hours, generally they're about an hour and a half with a long fight to get her to nap. when she naps most of the time she lays on me in the recliner and i get in a little nap too because i am exhausted. i find myself getting so frustrated and crying so much lately. i feel like i can't do anything right. i feel like everyone who told me i would be a horrible mom was right. i swear i try to do everything right but i am so tired anymore that i just don't even have any ideas on what to do. it is 11.30 now and she is just hysterically crying still. it makes me feel so awful. any advice is welcome, please. i am so lost.	pastel-clown	/r/Mommit/comments/iuce7f/i_need_help_or_advice_please_i_feel_like_i_am/	4	2	0	0.67	1600317119.0

so fellow momma's... advice about screen time!	i am a first time mom to a beautiful baby boy . he's three months old and an awesome kid. i am an avid activity mom, tummy time and other baby excersises and we usually don't even have out tv on unless i'm nursing. i also love going on walks with him and just putting him in the carrier. my question. my son is currently going through a sleep regression/growth spurt and has been attached to me. how awful is it for me to put on a baby video for ten minutes in the morning to make myself breakfast? prior to his change in routine and demeanor i used to just be able to sit him in the swing with a toy and he'll hang out for ten minutes. i've also tried hanging toys on the floor while i make a quick meal/or tummy time with floor toys. that will only get me like three minutes. i love my son and i want to make sure i'm not screwing him up. he's far back from the tv and once my meal is done i turn off the tv and play/nurse him. the way i see it is making sure it's not overstimulating and to make sure i'm limiting it to just enough time for me to make and eat an egg and toast. i've been skipping breakfast due to his cries and it left me with such fatigue and migraine by the end of the week i needed to take care of myself. my husband helps when he's home but i'm a sahm for about 8-10 hours a day. i just feel awful and selfish. it's just the only way i've found he's not screaming and i get ten minutes to breathe. i've only just done this like yesterday but i am worried i'm making a huge mistake. thank you in advance for any and all advice.	mom_jeans21	/r/Mommit/comments/iw32px/so_fellow_mommas_advice_about_screen_time/	12	7	0	1.0	1600558371.0
does anyone else experience this?	my three month old is suuuuper expressive with me but only me. when she's around other people she gets really serious and quiet and sometimes other people will try to talk to her or hold her and she starts pouting/crying almost immediately. i feel a bit bad sometimes but other times i don't since i want her to be with me anyway. but i'm planning on sending her to daycare hopefully by the beginning of the year so i want her to be a bit more comfortable away from me even if it's just for a couple days or so. anyway the main thing is that she's not fond of anyone else and if it's normal.		/r/Mommit/comments/iwo8zo/does_anyone_else_experience_this/	5	2	0	1.0	1600642439.0
struggling to navigate new motherhood in pandemic	hi all, first time poster here. i am a 25 year old female, and i gave birth to my first daughter in june. so far, shes been a joy and blessing. however, my husband and i are the first in our group of friends to have kids, and i can feel us drifting from them. the pandemic has not helped as our friends have continued to live their lives without much fear while weve hunkered down at home for months. i try not to divulge too much when my friends ask how im doing, but ill be honest ive certainly been better. our daughter is in the middle of the 4 month sleep regression, and i havent gotten more than 2 consecutive hours of sleep for nearly 2.5 weeks. i have a demanding job in social services, with those demands only increasing as the pandemic continues. i am working from home and feeling pretty isolated. i finally reached out to my best friend today telling her i am drained and not doing as well as id like to. her response pour yourself a cup of coffee, and take a bath with some wine tonight. ^^^ i know this is well intentioned, but i also feel that it is a superficial response meant to end the discussion without any effort to understand how im feeling. i think all new moms will empathize when i say that self care isnt necessarily face masks and manicures anymore as they are just more things i feel pressured to squeeze into an already crammed day. but i dont know how to explain this without offending her. mommas, how did you navigate your friendships after children, especially if you were the first in your group of friends to have them? any advice on how to do this in a pandemic? thank you in advance 	HoneyBee0602	/r/Mommit/comments/ixsadr/struggling_to_navigate_new_motherhood_in_pandemic/	21	28	0	0.94	1600796594.0

what do you do about toddler screeching?	i have a very sweet 21mo boy, but he's starting to get into this screenching phase when he's protesting. if he does it during regular play or whatever, then he's all done with that activity and he is given something else to do. however, i'm not sure what to do while he's eating. i'm not down for the all-done-notion during meals because he's not the chunkiest and i want him to eat. i do let him stop when he's full though, in but force feeding him. any tactics that have worked for you? i've done the turning away so he doesn't get the attention. i've covered my ears and told them that hurts my ears.

why i'm a big fan of my extra 25lbs post-baby. something to think about for those struggling with the weight gain.	my mom was overweight my whole life. she had bad knees and had 13 pregnancies . she was also the most loving, cuddly, warm person ever. i used to wake up with her at 6am and wait for her to be done her workouts so that i could squeeze in a few minutes of morning snuggles before the other kids got up. my 5yo also demands morning snuggles with me now. i found as i got older that i was more attracted to guys that were in the dad bod category, and i think that's because i loved that squishy warmth from my mom and needed that in a partner. my now-husband carries around that extra weight and although i want him to be healthy and live a long time... i'd also mourne his big belly if he ever lost it ! i'm so happy to carry the extra weight around from having my babies because to me they're getting that extra warm squishy snuggles that i wouldn't otherwise be able to give them. after my first i was so busy with school and work and didn't eat enough and breastfed for 2 years so i got really skinny and although i looked good i didn't feel good. but now when i snuggle my baby we just melt into eachother with all my squishy rolls. when i snuggle my 5yo to sleep some days she loves to get a handful of belly or boob, loves to squish me and says i'm always cuddly and warm now. and weirdly enough my husband says i'm much more attractive when i've got some extra weight on me. i jiggle more and he loves it so yeah. i'll keep eating because i love food and i'll keep working out because it makes me feel good and i'll keep snuggling the heck outta my babies with my squishy mommy body and i'll love it and wear it with pride.	b3ani3s__mama_939	/r/Mommit/comments/j68jpk/why_im_a_big_fan_of_my_extra_25lbs_postbaby/	3	13	0	0.93	1602002784.0

nap advice	ok mommit, i need advice. i have a 5 month old beautiful boy who i am trying to help guide through the perilous journey of sleep, but honestly i have zero idea what i am doing. his bedtime routine is on point, and he was sleeping through the night up until he hit 4 month regression and now wakes up 2 to 3 times per night and has trouble putting himself back to sleep. his daytime naps / him learning how to put himself back down are my struggles. i have always baby worn him when he was upset, and now its the only way he wants to nap during the day. now i'm stuck because he hates sleeping in his crib for naps and almost outright refuses to. i've tried ferber, put up put down method, etc. but its not a fun time. i always wait until he's drowsy, but as soon as i lay him down, he immediately starts kicking, slapping his arms, and squealing with all of this excitement, no matter how tired he is. que 45 to an hour of him crying and me consoling him, rocking him, patting him, and he may finally fall asleep, but will only stay asleep for 10 minutes or less. i have a friend who did cry it out, but it seems like every professional book or internet guru is anti-cry it out and will talk about how it messes your kid up . i would like for my son to not become a mini ted bundy and kill my cats, so i need some tips and advice. what am i doing wrong / what should i do. i know everyone is different and every baby is different. it just seems like my baby will never relax, and i don't know if what i am doing is right. tldr 5 month baby, no nap. help.		/r/Mommit/comments/j6wrg1/nap_advice/	10	2	0	1.0	1602096495.0

dad smokes weed and it makes me mad...why	i need to see a therapist, maybe a marriage counselor. but are there other moms out there with a similar predicament? when my husband and i first got together he was a non smoker. we both had some instabilities in our mental health lol. we saw separate psychologists, got on personalized meds and gained a bunch of coping skills. i have/had disordered eating, which is stress related and have been symptom free for years. im still on meds but things are chill. my husband has generalized anxiety and depression. his symptoms are pervasive and interferes with his life on a daily basis but its a part of who he is and its all good. about a year ago, my husband started smoking weed, to help him sleep and i wasnt a fan but hes a big boy and im not about to control his actions, and besides, at the time i would have a beer or two with dinner or a glass of wine at night to unwind. so samesies right? now im 7 months pregnant with our third and clearly not drinking and i feel like i have a serious issue with his smoking. he never smokes in front of our two little boys and they never see it, but i do. he smokes as soon and he wakes up, while hes working from home, and the last thing he does before bed. it aggravates me...but why? can anyone help with any insight? its legal where i live. the kids dont see it. but i hate it. tl dr husband started smoking weed, to sleep, and now its an all day thing. why does it bother me??	vertterre	/r/Mommit/comments/j7ru83/dad_smokes_weed_and_it_makes_me_madwhy/	19	13	0	0.89	1602214431.0

how do you deal with mil playing favorite grandchild?	ok, backstory, i have a 2 year old daughter and were currently living with my husbands parents until our own apartment is finished hopefully next year. so, my in-laws favor the eldest sons daughter probably because they took care of her for 2 full years instead of not going to daycare a lot of people already know this fact so we already accepted it. it just annoys me sometimes when i see how she looks after her, how she plays with her, how she interacts with her compared to how she treats my daughter when we are actually living together. we send our daughter to daycare for half-day so they dont have to take care of her the fave grandchild is now 3, which means she can now go to kindergarten. the thing is, when she is sick and not allowed to go to kindergarten, she comes here to stay with us at home so the parents can still go to work and even have fun on weekends. how inconsiderate is that? my daughter gets sick too because of her. and it happened a lot of times already. i told my husband this a lot of times. i asked if he can tell his brother not to take their daughter here when she is sick but they still do. they say oh its nothing contagious, her fever is gone blah blah but the child still has colds and cough. and the mil seems to not care for my childs health just so long as she can cater to the needs of the fave grandchild and the parents. i cant wait to move, but as of now, how do you handle this? i just moved here in germany 2 years ago and no family or friends of my own, which makes it harder to deal with everything. thoughts?	jammikins	/r/Mommit/comments/j8jlbl/how_do_you_deal_with_mil_playing_favorite/	10	20	0	0.92	1602332733.0

after years of serious depression, i finally feel like the mom i want to be	two years ago this month, i almost took my life. on the ledge where i was about to jump, one of the last things i was thinking was this is what's best for my son who was 7 at the time. i'd been on every medication on the planet, struggled with cocaine addiction and self harm, hated my life and hated myself as a mom. the right song playing at the right time brought me down off the ledge and i found the strength to start making changes in my life to find genuine happiness despite being told by mental health professionals that it was impossible. i was officially decertified as having a serious mental illness in june of this year after nearly two decades of clinical depression. i still struggled with feeling like an unworthy mom. like there was some kind of connection missing. a couple of weeks ago, we were at the park where i've been taking him after school and no other kids were there. instead of telling him to go play by himself so i could text my friends or post on ig, i played with him. we laughed and spoke french with each other and raced on the zipline. when other kids finally arrived, i took a book out of my car instead of my phone and i started reading. two pages in i was smacked with this warm feeling in my heart and laid the book down. i did it. a few tears ran down my face. i finally was the mom i wanted to be. the mom my little guy deserves. then, the more i stopped to think about it, the more i realized that i'd always been an amazing mom. i mean seriously, i pulled off getting one of his big dreams you can see what it was and his reaction here i just wanted to share for anyone who might be feeling down on themselves, questioning themselves or who struggle like i did or you just want to see a 9 year old geek out. aim to improve, but recognize your strengths and the love you have for your kids as well <3	pixieyogi81	/r/Mommit/comments/jd1ue5/after_years_of_serious_depression_i_finally_feel/	5	20	0	0.86	1602964196.0
nap advice needed!	hi fellow moms, i have a situation i can't seem to find any information on. my son is 17 months and has transitioned to one nap. usually he wakes around 8, naps for 2-3 hours around 1, and goes down for the night around 8. lately he's started waking a little earlier, 7-7 30, then he's so fussy and ready for his nap by 10 or 11. if i put him down he'll go to sleep for maybe an hour and a half, but then he'll be fussy for much of the afternoon and won't take a second nap, then he's grumpy and ready for bed by 6 or earlier. i've been trying to stretch the morning to at least noon, but i'm not always successful and he hasn't been making it easy. what i'm wondering is, should i just let him nap when he seems ready and then put him down for the night right after dinner? should i keep trying to stretch the morning and hope his schedule can go back to the way it was? i miss my goofy happy boy and just want to get him back; help!	considerthelilies	/r/Mommit/comments/jer70a/nap_advice_needed/	3	2	0	0.76	1603205996.0

sleep training after cosleeping? advice for a very clingy sensitive baby?	so my son, now almost 11 months, did sleep in his crib for the first few months of his life. i was always in the room with him, and i breastfeed so he was always comforted and easily put back to sleep. however, from day 1 he has been awful at sleeping in his crib. getting more than an hour at a time, even overnight, even at 4 months old, was impossible. he sometimes only made it 20 minutes. he would wake screaming. if i put him in his crib while awake he screamed. at 4 months old, i was falling asleep feeding him from exhaustion. i often let him nap on me to ensure he got some good sleep. finally i gave in to my partners gentle push to try cosleeping. and he suddenly slept 4-5 hours at a time. for both of our survival we have been cosleeping since. i do want him to sleep in his crib. i know it is safer. i want my bed back. and he's now old enough that i am waking him up by rolling over etc. he will also go into his crib for short periods to play without getting too upset. he is not a candidate for cry it out , ever since he was born he will literally puke within minutes from screaming so hard if left alone when upset. he does not eventually calm down and self soothe. also once he has an episode like that he will no longer trust us for the rest of the day or night and will panic anytime he is put down. normally he will happily explore and play by himself now, but after we break his trust he is terrified. we made a plan to try again this weekend. does anyone have any suggestions or experience getting clingy babies to sleep in cribs? i know he is going to want me to pick him up and soothe him back to sleep, but everything i am told says to comfort them in the crib. do we just keep him entertained and playing in the crib until he gets tired and passes out?

gimme all your breast pump advice	can we talk breast pumps real quick? with my first i had a medela pump and did not respond to it at all. i would sit there for 30-40 minutes and get barely an ounce, but he would nurse just fine and get more than enough when he did. i ended up quitting the pump and staying home with him for almost a year because i didnt wanna give up nursing altogether. but this time around, nursing on demand is not gonna be an option after 6 weeks because we have to go back to work. the good part about that is that shell at least be at my job because i work at a daycare and shell be in the infant room. so i can take pumping/nursing breaks. my question is this what pumps do you guys like? what pumps have you used? gimme all your insight, pros/cons, anything ya got. i qualify for a free one through my insurance but im also willing to buy one if i find one i like that isnt covered.	klaumc	/r/Mommit/comments/jfmkpe/gimme_all_your_breast_pump_advice/	42	14	0	0.95	1603317201.0

i moved in with a mysterious guy and i need some advice.	here goes, apologies if this sounds like some kind of novel, it feels like im in one, its as bizarre for me as it sounds. im just looking for any insight from outsiders. im a single mother to two late-teens girls, and a pre-teen boy. im currently in the process of divorcing their father, who has become very abusive and aggressive since the split. weve always rented and money is tight so ive been very stressed about where me and the kids were going to live as i couldnt afford the rent on our family home alone. heres where things get interesting. my son is on the autism spectrum. as he requires some extra attention in school, hes in a lunch group with other similar children. myself and the parents of those other children are all quite close and we meet up whenever we can and always make sure to invite each others children to events and such. one of the parents is a single dad called morgan. his son is close in age to my son so we meet up often. morgan is basically the hot dad, the one all the moms drool over. hes so ridiculously smooth that you just cant help but blush around him ugh. so, anyway, i mentioned to my group of parent friends about my worries with my housing situation and the divorce around a month ago. theyre aware of what my ex is currently being like and only a few days before hed physically assaulted me . as i was talking it over with them, morgan just said move in with me. like just straight up said move in. i kind of laughed like surrrrrre as if he was joking but he confirmed he was serious. all the other moms were as shocked as myself. morgan said that as its only him and his son in the house, id actually be helping him too as hed have extra hands. i pondered over it for a week but ultimately accepted morgans offer after finding out he has room for myself and my children to have a room each. weve now been in morgans house for 2 weeks. i feel safe knowing theres a man here who knows what my ex is like and he reassured me that he wont let my ex on the property. the house has security cameras and a gate with a buzzer and keypad to enter which has me at ease. i have lots of questions surrounding morgan and this whole situation though, but im not sure what to do about it. i know him well on sort of a friendship level as ive seen him 2-3 times a week for a number of years including meeting up for drinks, parties, trips with the children etc... however i dont know much else other than hes a sweet, attractive, kind, loving dad and generous guy. my biggest question is, i actually have no idea what he does for a job or how he can afford this house. this house must be worth a few million minimum. myself and the other moms assumed he ex military before i saw his house . we only moved in a few weeks ago, and a few days in he asked if i could watch his son because he was going to work and didnt know how long hed be gone. he was gone from 4pm-9am. what the hell kind of job has those hours? my daughters the next morning were like omg mom he must be a spy or something and for minute i did wonder lol. he doesnt seem to have any work pattern. hes said hes going to work 3 times in the past 2 weeks and two were overnight and once during the day. am i reading too much into this and being too nosy or should i be asking these questions? my other question is i have no idea about his sons mother. i havent heard her mentioned although i do see framed photos of her with morgan and their son . is she dead, alive, a deadbeat? is she going to show up, if so what do i do? myself and my kids feel very secure here and morgan has known my kids for years, they joke around with him and he is a very good father to his son and i have no red flags when it comes to having him around mine, im saying this because my sister said i was crazy to move us into a mans house that i dont know everything about. im not entirely sure where my boundaries are with him, like whats too rude to ask, what am i entitled to know. i dont think hed be offended with me asking anything as hes always been an open book when myself and other moms have asked personal questions, but i dont want to overstep my boundaries when living under his roof. ... also, im kind of majorly crushing on him like a schoolgirl and absolutely trying to refrain from making a move for many reasons including the fact hes almost 10 years younger than me. however i do feel like hes been very flirty with me since moving in. it feels like ive known him my whole life but i know very little about him. a few nights ago we were both in the kitchen and he needed to scoot by me and as he did he sort of put both his hands on my hips as he moved passed and made eye contact the whole time. i was so close to leaning in and kissing him. he may be a damn hooker for all i know though so im just trying to tell myself to calm damn and that im probably getting flustered as ive not had male attention in many years. morgan has also offered to help me financially with my divorce which i have gratefully accepted. this all feels too good to be true, like what the heck is actually going on. i really dont know what to think of all of this, but at the same time i am just enjoying feeling secure and free. im really sorry this is so long and very jumbled. im not totally sure why im even writing here but i guess some insight, opinions, suggestions and advice from others can always be helpful. thank you. oh also im sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. please point me in the right direction if so.

advice for pumping at work	i posted this on r/mommit but thought this subreddit might have some help as well. i learned my school district is making us return to the building in november. despite the numbers rising, and our district being the fifth highest in the state. i'm angry and feeling helpless, but one of my questions is about pumping. my son will be 6 months when i return and currently he's 95% ebf, 100% pumped. we'd like to keep him on breastmilk if possible, as he needs a specialized formula. i've spoken to my principal and she's helped me get someone to cover my class for a period of time at least once a day so that takes some anxiety away. and i know that i'm legally allowed to pump, but i also know that in education they love to make you sacrifice because schools can't afford what they need to, so i'm getting ready to be very noisy about what i need. my questions are what tips do you have, for advocating for what you need , or pumping at work in general, or pumping as a teacher specifically? i teach high school, if that makes a difference.

how to punish a 2 year old for hitting?	my daughter will be 2 in february, so not quite 2 yet but close enough and she is in the hitting stage. right now she only does it when i pick her up to remove her from somewhere that she doesnt want to leave . first i try to get her to leave voluntarily, but if she refuses i will pick her up, carry her out, and close the door. as soon as i pick her up she will lean back and hit me as hard as she can. usually i will firmly grab her hands and very sternly tell her no! you do not hit. usually at that point she will burst into tears and cry/yell, so i put her down and she throws herself onto her stomach and just lay there and cry/yell, so then i just walk away and ignore her until she is done. then i will get on her level and calmly explain to her that its not nice to hit people when shes mad and she usually then comes in for a hug. is this a good method to teach her not to hit? she obviously realizes that she has done something wrong, but the next time i have to make her leave somewhere she just does it all over again, so i dont know if its actually working or not. should i try to implement a time out system, or is she too young still? i also have a very clingy infant now that doesnt like to be put down so i just dont know how practical it would be to try time out. i used to watch supernanny all the time when i was younger so i know how important it is to be consistent about making them stay in time out & keep putting them back when they leave their spot until their time is up, but i just dont know if thats practical for an almost 2 year old. i also realize that every child is different and one punishment might work well for one kid but not another, but right now ill take any suggestions. i want to try and knock this behavior out before her sister gets old enough to play with her.

need advice gift cards for a friend who's a mom	my good friend had a son this past february, and her birthday is in november. we live in different states. i'm thinking of getting her a couple gift cards, but they mainly have to do with her being a mom gift cards to amazon , artifact uprising , and gathre . or for doordash or some local restaurants, so that she and her husband won't have to cook. i don't have children so i'm a bit hesitant on what i'm about to say, but i don't want her to feel like she's just a mom now - she's still a person with likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., right? - but obviously her son is one of the most important things in her life now, and most of her time and attention is going to him. my questions are these would you all prefer getting birthday gifts related to parenthood/your children/your family, and time-saving gifts/gifts of convenience like restaurant or delivery credit? or would you want something more focused on you and your hobbies? did you have time for hobbies, with a 9-month old? are gift cards the way to go? thanks for any advice.	vmiko	/r/Mommit/comments/jj7u8o/need_advice_gift_cards_for_a_friend_whos_a_mom/	5	2	0	1.0	1603826477.0
need advice from other moms who had pelvic pain during 3rd trimester	hey all! i couldnt find anything on google and i dont want to call my doctor if im being over dramatic. ive been diagnosed by my pelvic floor therapist with severe spd. i can walk through it, get up and down, ive basically dealt with the everyday groin pain and groaning to get up or out of bed. she said its not worrisome or anything. so im thinking cool ill just handle it for ten more weeks until hes due and well be good to go, no big deal. until today. i went to the supermarket and slipped on a wet spot on the floor. i almost feel but my legs spread apart and i tensed up and caught myself. the elevated pain in my groin was so bad that i almost fell from it. i could barely walk through the rest of the store. luckily i only needed three things that were fairly close to each other and i left. this was 4 hours ago, ive been sitting with ice on my groin for 3 hours and the pain is still so severe i cant hardly walk without holding onto the wall or furniture for support. my husband has been a god send and ive been resting while he takes care of our 5 year old and he made dinner. but the pain is starting to not only stay at a constant 9 but its radiating into my stomach. i honestly have a high pain tolerance and i just cry every time i get up. my question is, should i call the after hours doctor about this or is it normal for people who have spd? the radiating and intense pain that wont subside even a bit is what scares me.	adeco19	/r/Mommit/comments/jjcuma/need_advice_from_other_moms_who_had_pelvic_pain/	4	1	0	1.0	1603842154.0
advice wanted- how do you manage toys?	i am a little overwhelmed with the amount of toys we have for my just-turned-1yr old. we had a good many toys already, and just received so many more for her birthday. i am very grateful for the gifts, especially at a time when i know people are struggling. i am lucky to have so many people who care and are generous. i dont mean to complain, i just have laundry baskets full of toys already and need a plan/process to manage them. the only thing that is going right seems to be books. we keep a book case in her bedroom and have a couple favorites on the coffee table in the living room. everything else i started to keep in a big basket in our living/play area. this worked great when her toys were simple 1 piece things. now i feel like were drowning in toys with multiple parts, chunky puzzles, big block/diplo set , etc. is there a system that works for you? do you set some toys away or rotate them? how do you store puzzles so they dont drive you crazy to pick up? how do you know when theyve grown out of using a certain toy? thanks in advance! edit thanks for all of the helpful tips! ill definitely be trying the clear plastic bins, out of sight bins, and rotating things out.	nthngbtblueskies	/r/Mommit/comments/jjf9m4/advice_wanted_how_do_you_manage_toys/	15	6	0	0.88	1603850934.0
advice on snacking/treats	i like to be consistent in the amount of meals and snacks my son eats a day. typically 3 meals and 1 snack in between them . ive asked that family and friends first ask mom or dad if they can give him a snack/treat because he eats like crazy. he will just keep going and going and going no matter how much hes already had. while they find this cute, it leads to begging and expectant behavior at home. my sister in law seems to be the only one who cant respect my request . she will constantly snack herself and continually offers them to my son without asking us first or occasionally asks us after shes already offered him the food. we were visiting with her for only an hour the other day and she gave my son 3 different snacks. i didnt see the first time, the second i interrupted once i noticed and said no thank you, weve had enough sweets today and the last time she did it while i was in the other room. i obviously cant have my eyes glued on her 24/7. when i complain to my bf he says idk go tell her again, shes just being helpful and is of no help. how should i remind her for the 5th time that she needs to first check in with mom and dad?	reenie612	/r/Mommit/comments/jjgdmp/advice_on_snackingtreats/	3	2	0	1.0	1603855337.0
how do i stop worrying that our 15mo old son isn't eating enough and start weaning him off of the night/morning bottles?	our son is 15 mos old and constantly moving, so he's a pretty lean baby to start with. he's perfectly on his curve according to his pediatrician, so i shouldn't be worried. but i'm a mama, and man do i worry for no reason at all, lol. still, it's been a really weird transition to go from the habit of making bottles 24/7 to suddenly having to balance healthy meals and snacks and making sure he's getting enough full calories rather than filling up on empty calories like crackers and grains. at this point, i think we're getting a good pattern down for b/l/d and snacks, but our son is still drinking one bottle an hour before bed and a bottle in the morning before he wakes. it's a 5oz bottle of half water, half whole milk, and one scoop of formula. i think i started doing this because i figured it would give him a shot of fatty milk and calories from the formula which could help make up for any lack throughout the day. but, there's no scientific logic behind this. it just made me feel better about my anxiety of not meeting a standard. his ped keeps saying we need to be getting him off of the bottle, but i don't know how. do i just stop it cold turkey? switch to a sippy cup first and then work the mix down to just water? can you guys offer me any advice or suggestions that worked for you?

 if you want help, all you need to do is ask me... 	i feel it important to say right away that i truly am thankful for my husband and all that he does for me and our son. overall, he is a great husband and a great father. but... this f sentence drives me up the mother-f wall ! it usually comes out after a day of me tending to a teething toddler, struggling to figure out what he wants because he has realized he can make independent choices with no logic or consistency, cleaning up messes that i already cleaned up twice before, cycling load after load of laundry and load after load of dishes... i know i signed up for this new life and i'm honestly okay with it, but it's hard to argue against the fact that it's easier to manage when you have unsolicited help from your partner. the reason this sentence pisses me off is because it seems to imply that these things i should ask for help with are ultimately my responsibility, and if i want any help with it then i need to ask for it. i mean, i know that this isn't the whole truth of the matter, but that's exactly how this sentence feels. what i need is for you to recognize that you can offer to help me without me having to ask. i want you to see that i'm exhausted. i want you to see that you have two feet, and two hands, and half of a brain to do the things i'm doing without needing to be asked to do it. start a load of laundry when you see our son's hamper is full. put the dishes in the sink into the dishwasher when you step into the kitchen to make a snack. pick up a few toys from the walkway as you walk back to the kitchen. wipe down a counter or two every once in a while. i understand that you see me doing everything before you have a chance to do it and i accept that, but that doesn't have to stop you from recognizing the type of person you know i am - that i will do it just to get it done, no matter how taxed i am. it doesn't stop you from saying, honey, i got this. take a break. even if i tell you no, it's okay. i got it. just knowing that you are able to recognize my stress and are willing to offer help without me having to ask lifts a hundred pounds off of my shoulders. i don't need your help on these days . i need you to pick up your half of the reality that is our life now.

moms who have endo, what's your experience?	this is to any mamas out there who have endometriosis did being pregnant change your endo symptoms? how did endo return after pregnancy? was it worse, better, or did it disappear? does breastfeeding help keep symptoms away? i've read a few articles that say breastfeeding produced the same or similar hormones to what is produced during pregnancy, so breastfeeding can delay the return of endo symptoms. is this true in your case?? i have suspected endo and have for four years. i finally caved to the pain this summer and went to a doctor for a laparascopy, which never happened because i found out i am pregnant! at this point, i'm planning to get a lap when i'm done having kids, as i've heard excision scarring can make it harder to get or stay pregnant, etc. until i can get a lap, i'm trying to find ways to keep that pain at bay so i can focus on being a mom. i can't imagine being crippled with a flare up and responsible for a baby at the same time. looking for your experiences specifically on pregnancy and motherhood with endo! edit to add i joined nancy's nook on fb and it has lots of amazing endo resources, including doctor lists and study-based evidence for pain management, etc. i highly recommend going to the page if you're looking for any endo help! i have learned a lot from it. here's the web page as well 	reinadelhelado	/r/Mommit/comments/jnag7s/moms_who_have_endo_whats_your_experience/	4	1	0	1.0	1604410944.0

what do you do when your baby just won't sleep?	my first baby is 10 months old and for the most part, she's really easy to care for. lately, however, she's not sleeping. i've heard of a sleep regression at this age, which is the only thing i can think of since she's not teething and isn't running a fever. she's been sleeping a solid 12 hours for at least 2 months now, but lately she's been waking at 1 and won't go back to sleep. i tried nursing her, laying her on my chest to try to get her to sleep, bringing her into our bed, i even crawled into her crib last night! these things seemed to work for a while, but as soon as i went to leave, she'd wake up screaming. i understand i may just have to wait it out, but i'm at my wits end on how to deal with this in the meantime. i've maybe had 1 and a half hours of sleep last night and i wanna cry just looking at her . i'm just expecting another night like this to happen soon and i'm hoping i can handle it better than i did last night. what do you do when your baby won't sleep, you're exhausted and crying, and you can't get someone to help you till the morning?	phantommoose	/r/Mommit/comments/jnzfey/what_do_you_do_when_your_baby_just_wont_sleep/	10	4	0	0.84	1604506336.0

how to deal with feelings of resentment??	dont get me wrong, i dont hate or regret having a child, but i feel like my life is so boring now. my child is 13 months and im turning 26 this month. i feel like i was always very responsible and mature as a child so my teenage years and young adult years werent spent just being carefree and having fun. i guess strict parents didnt really help either. im thankful i didnt doing anything really stupid, but at the same time i feel like i wasted my chance to have fun in life. i feel like i dont fit in with anyone. im too old to fit in with the young adults, plus im the only one with a kid. and i feel too young to fit in with older adults. i try to connect with them, but the things they talk about and do just bore me. i want to be able to stay out past midnight kicking it with my friends cuz why the hell not. i want to spend all day at the beach. i want to have impromptu road trips or camping trips. i want to play in a mediocre band in one of our garages. i want friends who are stupid, sarcastic, smart asses and we laugh our butts off all night. instead im chasing a toddler around so any conversation i try to have with anybody is cut short. and the people who do talk to me seem to just want to talk about parenthood, cooking, work, etc. and my husband is down to do things, but hes perfectly content staying home every night watching tv. and i hate how ok he is with that kind of life. i want exciting dates, i want adventures. and i try to make it happen but i dont know how. now im too tired to do anything because my child wakes up like 5 times a night so my sleep sucks. and now cuz of covid im stuck at home with nothing to do except go to target or something my myself. and now she wants to walk everywhere and grab everything so even that is too stressful. i just feel like by the time she is older ill be too old to live the life i want. and again, i love her to death and there are so many good things about her. im just talking about this one feeling that i cant shake. how do you guys deal with any resentment? i dont see me having anymore kids until at least 5 years from now because of this. but i dont want my daughter to ever feel this from me. i dont want her to think she was a mistake or an interruption in my life. moms! help me out here, im kinda in a low place right now 	frenchfrygirll	/r/Mommit/comments/jq2j81/how_to_deal_with_feelings_of_resentment/	5	5	0	0.65	1604797755.0
advice on 11 mo old who is not gaining enough weight	i'm frustrated and feel like i'm failing. my lo was 10th percentile in weight since he was born until a month ago. he went down to below 3rd percentile. a month later and he's just above the 3rd percentile. for the last 5 weeks i've fed him high calorie and good fats so i was hoping he'd be back at the 10th but wasn't. he's 25th percentile in height and also 3rd for head circumference. his diet consists of iron fortified oatmeal + formula + hemp seeds, coconut milk and fruit puree, avocado toast with rye bread, egg yolks, avocado oil, butter, chicken, beef, salmon, pork, etc. basically high calorie foods. i also feed him fruits like oranges and kiwi. this is what i feed him but he doesn't eat a lot. he doesn't seem interested in food in general. he'd rather play than eat. he's non-stop moving, so active and also an early walker. loves to climb. we only eat at the table and eat together. in his stools i can see pieces of carrots and hemp seeds. does he not absorb his food? any suggestions to get him to absorb calories? or maybe he has high metabolism? a blood test was ordered and i'm waiting to see results.	mang0es	/r/Mommit/comments/jq4xvn/advice_on_11_mo_old_who_is_not_gaining_enough/	8	3	0	0.72	1604807348.0

moms who wanted children but who suffered from tokophobia, how did you get through it?	i have always wanted children. always. it has been my absolute dream. but i have a very, very deep fear of childbirth. it isnt that i am afraid of pregnancy itself, that part is fine, and actually really excites me. however, childbirth is a different story. i get absolutely nauseous to the point of panic attack when i think about childbirth. while for other people it seems excruciating, intense, overwhelming, but beautiful and even exciting, for me it feels nothing short of gutturally horrifying to me. the idea of a c section is a bit more soothing, and even an epidural sounds helpful. but one involves cutting me open, the other involves sticking a massive needle in my back which also triggers a level of panic. i have no idea why i feel this way. i dont know when or how this came about. but i dont know what to do, because i want kids, and adoption and surrogates seem like financially upfront they will be out of what i will ever be able to pay. plus, i really want to experience pregnancy. just not vaginal childbirth. did anyone else suffer from this but successful have a child? are there any tips or therapies anyone can suggest?	artgirl413	/r/Mommit/comments/jqr6hl/moms_who_wanted_children_but_who_suffered_from/	9	13	0	0.93	1604897104.0

new mom asking advice for two month old	hello mom's. i have recently had my first child. it was a stressful pregnancy because of placenta issues. this was causing him not to grow as he should. they were concerned he could have been born earlier than his due date. so i spent five grueling weeks of non stress tests and ultrasounds once per week. he was born at thirty six weeks. at 5lbs 8oz and lost 12% of his body weight after he was c section delivered. he was admitted to the nicu for two weeks. where they focused heavily on bottle and not breast. ever since he was born i have been pumping and bottle feeding him my breast milk. needless to say i am exhausted of pumping. it hurts one of my breasts and i am tired the pain and uncomfortability of it. my question to you ladies is how do i switch from pumping to formula for my mental health.	girlygeek89	/r/Mommit/comments/jsmfil/new_mom_asking_advice_for_two_month_old/	10	4	0	0.83	1605148630.0

what a difference a child makes	i hate when google pops up memories from almost a year ago and i love it. it's so sweet and awesome to see the difference in my lil bubby in the 10 months of his short little life. then again i also have to see the difference a year and a child makes in mommy and it's disappointing my face just looks so tired and worn out. i never wear my makeup anymore. i rarely touch my hair. my son is fed and clean and happy but mommy not so much. i'm exhausted and disgusted and where my life is ,not as a mother just as an individual. there are legal things i've still not accomplished in the split with an old ex husband . i still haven't accomplished anything in my life besides being a mother and that's something literally anyone can be and most are in my part of the world being a southern gal. i don't do much i just keep this tiny human going and ignore myself. my love life with daddy is non-existent because of the tiny human and his work schedule since he's the only provider for not only us but mostly his mother and father as well. he's an amazing father and a wonderful man and i am blessed but at this rate i'm likely to lose that too lol. just google really hurt me today and i needed to express it. am i alone? do other moms feel this way? have you felt this way and if so how'd you fix it? i just keep thinking if i had the energy to do this n' that and it never comes. i'm positive i have depression as well that's just all out on the table no argument there i just don't have the money or the will to go to a doctor. just looking for any thoughts on it. a tortured mom soul	TMBmama2020	/r/Mommit/comments/jth63n/what_a_difference_a_child_makes/	68	317	0	0.96	1605279872.0

3 w.o. has his days and nights reversed, tips/advice would be much appreciated!	like the title says, my lo sleeps anywhere between 2-4 hours in between feedings during the day, but will only sleep for maybe 30 mins during the night in between constant feedings and diaper changes. it seems that during the night he just refuses to sleep in his basinet, and needs to be constantly held and fed so that he is not fussing and waking the entire household. needless to say, this situation is wreaking havoc on our entire daily routine and im really hoping that theres something i can do to correct it. admittedly, i havent been the best at keeping track of feedings and maintaining a consistent feeding/sleeping schedule, so i will try keeping him awake and getting more feedings in during the day at regular intervals rather than just relying on his hunger cues. thats really the only solution i can think of. im a first time mom and have very limited experience with babies, so any advice or tips on how to fix this would be a tremendous help!

questions for moms who got pregnant while nursing a baby	hey moms! i recently found out i am about 2 months pregnant with my fifth baby. number 4 is only 8 months old and is still exclusively breastfed . im still adjusting to this news and i have a couple questions about logistics. im dealing with a lot of anxiety and am trying to be prepared. i appreciate any stories, advice, or insights you may have. 1. did your milk supply change or decrease during your pregnancy? did your baby suddenly refuse to breastfeed? how long were did you breastfeed your older baby before the new baby arrived ? 2. did your baby have trouble adjusting around your growing belly to continue breastfeeding? 3. i will be 35 in 3 weeks, so i might be considered high risk due to my age. i didnt have any issues with my previous pregnancies, so im hoping that dr. google is wrong. if you were an older mom, did your dr encourage you to stop nursing due to your advanced maternal age ? 4. how did your baby adjust when the new baby arrived? obviously, weve been through this before. however, my oldest two are 19 months apart , so they arent as close together. theres a lot of developing between 15 and 19 months. my first ob appointment isnt until the beginning of december, which is why im anxiously asking strangers on reddit to help ease my mind. i typically wean my kids between 13 and 15 months. i plan on having this one completely weaned before 13 months, because i want to decrease the likelihood of her being jealous of the new baby. thankfully, shes a daddys girl, so im hoping that continues and strengthens as the pregnancy progresses. i realize that she might suddenly become extra attached to me, too. thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my questions! stay safe!

struggling with being pregnant, already having a 10 month old	im 13 weeks today and my lo just hit ten months, im feeling majorly guilty for my energy levels. its extremely hard for me to keep up with her and give her the play time i feel she deserves. its been a lot of movies. even getting some time to sleep in and taking naps when she does i seem to burn out fairly quickly. i push myself to sit down and play and try and teach her things but its hard not to compare or worry about where she could be if i was super dedicated. i know this trimester is supposed to be the toughest but its hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel. even tougher when im getting youd think you would have figured it out by now comments. is there anything second time moms did to keep up or entertain your babies while youre down and out?? she loves her toy story but it feels shitty.	sadgorl__98	/r/Mommit/comments/jztwps/struggling_with_being_pregnant_already_having_a/	6	7	0	0.82	1606176424.0

how reprioritizing saved me	when i had my first baby, i was woefully underprepared in all the ways that mattered and over-prepared in all the ways that didnt. i was an only child who felt awkward around children who couldnt talk so i didnt do much baby babysitting. the first diaper i ever changed was in the hospital after giving birth. i had endlessly researched and planned a home birth, we ended up in the hospital just to be safe. i worried and worried about breast feeding, but it was smooth sailing, though still exhausting. i learned everything there is to learn about cloth diapers , because i wanted to help the planet, but ended up driving myself into exhaustion to keep up with all my own standards instead. i wanted to be an excellent mom who did all the things and made all the best decisions. i painted a portrait for myself that looked nothing like me. she had a cape and never needed sleep. one ordinary saturday in that first year, i found myself screaming in the shower, holding the shower curtain in my teeth to keep myself from ripping it down. i was filled with unbridled rage id never felt before. i didnt know that humans shouldnt exist on less than 6 hours of a sleep at a time for more than a week. it was an entire year before my first baby slept through the night. i wasnt doing good. my coworkers words haunted me as i was packing up for maternity leave sleep now! she cackled, you wont have chance later! i nervously fidgeted my way out the door, not knowing exactly what that meant. what i didnt know at the time was how to be gentle with myself. i didnt know how to prioritize myself or even ensure that my basic needs were met. i didnt know that a dirty house and a relaxed mind is preferable to a rage-filled, mom stewing in a nauseating cocktail of resentment, exhaustion and frustration but have you seen how her laundry is done and the kitchen is clean? and her baby has fresh clean cloth diapers! i went to the doctor for my 6 week postpartum check up and my doctor said i might have a bit of baby blues, whatever that means. it didnt mean getting any help, that was for sure. i checked in with my midwife, she recommend i see someone. how was that supposed to happen? i had a full time teaching job during the day, my husband worked nights so we could afford to ya know like live and stuff. i also had to pump, manage milk all the time , do all the diaper laundry, keep the house clean, make my own baby food, lose 65 lbs of baby weight, grade papers, process whatever trauma happened at work i just didnt have the capacity to navigate the mental health care system and find the time off. knowing what i know now, i just want to give my past self a hug, make her a nice meal and tuck her in for a nap and tell her she can just stop. it felt impossible at the time. my cortisol levels were so high i couldnt sleep when the baby sleeps. pretty sure that was when the depression and anxiety really set in. i never even saw my husband, so i spent my days thinking about how i wish he were helping more, getting more done, being more affectionate, did more nice things, had more time for me. i had a long list of reasons why he should improve. oh and he should definitely appreciate me more because i was doing all the laundry. we were so exhausted that we couldnt even fight anymore. we spent a lot of time just looking out opposite windows and just staring. i missed my old life a lot. it was filled with sleeping and things i liked. but the crazy part is that now i see that every single one of my stressors was something that i chose. i chose to have a baby in the first place, i chose to use cloth diapers, i chose to be a teacher , i chose to continue working full time, i chose to move away from my friends, i chose to marry someone whose strong suits are many but do not include folding laundry. i chose not to get help when i definitely needed it. i chose to give up all my hobbies and interests. i chose to keep my house cleaner than absolutely necessary. i chose to commit to losing the baby weight faster than was healthy so i didnt have to buy a new wardrobe. i chose a life where napping wasnt easy. i didnt know that by prioritizing myself after everyone and everything else was slowly wearing down my identity until it was actually completely gone, leaving me unmoored and hopeless and still very very angry. i didnt know that motherhood requires a completely different approach than what i was used to. the work ethic that id learned in college and the work world wasnt the miracle solution id always assumed. i was showing up with the wrong tools for the job. i did manage to go to hypnotherapist after i raged and knocked over and broke a glass in the living room. he told me that i seemed stressed. thanks buddy, heres $150 buy yourself something nice, i know i wont be. i was a victim of my own making and victims dont buy themselves presents. after that first year, i managed to make a few better decisions but my relationship was still in shambles and would continue to deteriorate until i filed for divorce in 2017. i thought i would be better off alone than with a man that actively despised me. i was pretty unpleasable at the time, which is difficult for husbands to handle. when we separated, i started to take the burden of taking care of me off him and back onto me where it belonged. i started doing things i liked and i felt so much better. but i missed my husband. he was my soulmate. we had a lot of dreams together and it was hard to imagine me doing it alone, having my kids part time. actually it was easy to imagine, but it wasnt what i wanted. we decided to stay together since we had another baby on the way anyway. i was determined for this to be different. i committed to sleeping at least 6 hours a night, getting proper health care and medications if i started to spiral again, and i wasnt cloth diapering this time because im not superwoman. im a regular woman, who needs sleep, and relaxation, and time to herself. and i love that about me. it doesnt make me a failure. it makes me lovely. lovely to be around. lovely to interact with. lovely to look at. it makes me feel lovely inside now motherhood looks like taking 5 to 10 minutes to myself after every chore. its sitting and playing a random game of uno, or crawling into a fort built by my kids, who are now excellent at sleeping through the night. its thanking my husband for making me delicious meals and drinks. its staying in bed longer than i should according to any responsible persons schedule. its taking a bath instead of doing dishes if i feel like it. its telling my kids that im taking time for myself and laying out consequences if they pester me. it's communicating clearly what i want in a way that husband hears it. he makes sure im taken care of now, because he sees me doing it for myself. hes happy, im happy, and i get to stay with the man i married and enjoy it. was it easy? no. would it have been easier if i had had someone to help show me that i didn't have to do all the things to be a good mother? definitely. weve got to change things for ourselves. lets rethink some standards we have for ourselves here. lets give ourselves lots of breaks. our nurturing spirits need ample nurturing. i serve from my overflowing cup instead of being angry that its always empty because no one else filled it up for me. some women hear this and say, how i am i supposed to take care of me too? that sounds like another responsibility! and i say lets look around and see what you can drop so you have enough hands to pick yourself up. no one is going to do it for you. plus you are better at it than anyone else anyway. it just takes commitment and some easy and very-rewarding planning. find out what you are choosing to prioritize over yourself and stop. just stop. rest regularly. let yourself just flow and own your choices. maybe youll even find some gratitude just in time for thanksgiving in a year where its been difficult to find. im grateful for having a working washer and dryer, disposable diapers, hot meals that my husband makes, being home together all day every day, living in this amazing community on this incredible land and so much more. im grateful for my transformational reprioritization. im grateful for my health and my mental peace. im grateful that i rarely lose my temper anymore. im grateful that it all worked out. the self-portrait makes so much more sense now. she takes lots of naps and wears vintage skirts with sewn-in pockets instead of a cape, which is still pretty badass and much more useful.	happilyeverbonnie	/r/Mommit/comments/k0o6ha/how_reprioritizing_saved_me/	70	544	0	0.98	1606292158.0

here's my 15 year olds current bathroom routine. venting but need some advice	would like some advice right about now. maybe some ideas. currently sn 15 yo is doing pee training. poop is a whole nother story and i'm kind of losing hope at this point and we're probably not going to get there for a while now but would love to get through pee training now that he's showing signs of being ready and has used the toilet a few times already. i got a padded toilet seat with is characters on it and that was a good incentive, one time. he uses the regular toilet with the seat and he also has a commode potty in his room. he actually likes public bathrooms which makes literally no sense sweetie but alright. i don't think he's scared of the bathroom because he doesn't mind being in there at any time. we both picked out some adult training pants which are like regular underwear but they fit differently and are padded in case he pees and he just wears a pad for any number two, to replace full on diaper briefs. he only wears the diapers at night. honestly i have not the best experience and i'm a single mom with one perspective so i need some input. would like the get through current routine which consists of he has to pee we go to the bathroom/his room, either i take him or he takes me he sits down nothing he gets up and we leave ... he has to go we go in the bathroom/his room nothing we leave this goes on maybe every 30 minutes or so up until i found out he went in his training pants, or we go to the bathroom and he has an accident on the way there/while pulling down the pants. thank you and i appreciate any kind of input.

how to get 19 month old self feed 	i can't help but think i'm failing in this department. my toddler who is 19 months old does not know how to feed himself. i am a stay at home mom and my parents live with us. unfortunately i have depression and my mom sometimes undermine my authority when i tell her we should try to have him feed himself and no phone or tv time during meals. i do not want him to get in the habit of always having the phone or tv. another thing that hinders him from self feeding is the inconsistency. when i feed him, i do my best to have him eat with a spoon or fork himself. when my mom does mealtime, she automatically spoonfeeds him and let him be on the phone or turn on the tv so he doesn't squirm. she says it is faster and easier. i guess this post is about many things boundaries with my child, boundaries with my mom, feeding a 19 month old etc. what techniques did you guys do to get your toddler situated with self feed? my child does not seem to enjoy feeding himself.	finstafoodlab	/r/Mommit/comments/k58djj/how_to_get_19_month_old_self_feed_unfortunately_i/	9	2	0	1.0	1606912306.0
any tips for beating a virus that maybe we haven't already tried?	i will try to make this short, i posted the other day about how we were worried that after a 10 day round of antibiotics that his ear infection hadn't cleared up/came back, as his fever came back. well we went to the doctor monday and his ears were clear, the doctor walked in the room ready to talk about tubes, looked at his ears and said i can't even tell that he had an ear infection. she said his throat was a little red, probably some post nasal drip. all swabs came back clear. he had a good day tuesday. today, a low grade fever is back. we are just trying everything we can to help him kick whatever this is so it doesn't result in another ear infection. his only symptoms is just overall fussiness , low grade fever, and some nasal congestion. we have been trying warm baths in a steamy room to try to get things to break up so we can suck out his nose, but nothing comes out of his nose. do we continue with the saline spray and sucking? we got out the humidifier, but it is a cool air humidifier and his room is already at 45% humidity, we will probably keep it running on low. we do zyrtec every morning, recommended by his doctor back in the summer as he had a bout of this same issue that doc said definitely seemed consistent with allergies. lowered his milk intake, it does make him seem more congested, he gets some at daycare but that is it. the fever coming and going can get him somewhat dehydrated/constipated so it is just water and sometimes pedialyte or gatorade zero at home. we are trying to not do tylenol/motrin unless it gets too high so we can track his fever and try to let his little body do its thing at fighting whatever this is. i just want to do whatever i can for him, daycare has been so nice and understanding and working with us as much as they can while of course under covid constraints, his fever came back just before nap so they are letting him stay there to nap and then i will go get him. it is taking a toll on all of us at this point, it is hard to understand why he gets sick so often , and it always seem to drag out. i see another covid test probably in our future.	blijdschap	/r/Mommit/comments/k5fpbu/any_tips_for_beating_a_virus_that_maybe_we_havent/	3	1	0	1.0	1606935494.0

at what age did your child stop needing a diaper/pullup at night?	my 5 year old daughter has only gone a few nights in her life without peeing. i've tried quite a lot of different things with her. i tried waking her up every 2 hours to sit her on the potty. i tried an alarm for her to go potty in the night. the problem is she sits down and doesnt pee because she doesnt have to but then wakes up wet. i'm asking mainly because my 3 year old daughter has been potty trained day and night for over 6 months with only a few accidents a month. she has regressions where she'll pee every night for a week, but then she'll go back to normal. i was also potty trained by 2, and my mom is starting to really piss me off with how much she rubs in my face that my 5yo isnt doing that yet. she keeps accusing me of doing something wrong, or that something is wrong with her. or something happened to her. all of which are false and infuriate me. my husband told me that he had issues with bed wetting until he was about 12. so obviously its normal, but i'm just wondering when your child/ren stopped bedwetting and what you did to help them be successful. i cant tell she feels awful about it, especially when her younger sister can do it, but she cant.

advice for the constant toddler meltdowns	my kiddo is 15 months and everything right now seems to result in an utter meltdown. ...doesnt get his way..meltdown..wants me to hold him..meltdown... pick him up.. meltdown..wants to do something that will result in imminent pain for him and getting stopped..melt down... and the list goes on. and when i say melt down i mean hard core crying, snot flying everywhere, arching our back in ways no back should be arched, and slamming our head on the ground while hitting everyone around them melt down. i know this is a very self centered time in his development and he still isnt able to communicate which must be beyond frustrating for him, but man im so exhausted. i am hoping for advice from some moms who have been there on how to help navigate these meltdowns. i want to do whats going to help him best navigate these tough emotions but i feel like im stricking out at everything ive tried. ive tried making sure he was in a safe space to thrash around and ignoring to give him space to work it out but he just keeps escalating when that happens. ive tried sitting next to him and rubbing his back and telling him i love him but he usually gets more upset. ive tried talking to him and letting him know i can tell he is having big feelings that he doesnt understand or know what to do with and thats ok . its just so darn hard when they cant talk yet or really understand what you are saying. some days i just miss my happy baby and am not sure where this grumpy gremlin came from.

we never set out to be co-sleepers but here we are... how do we stop?	basically me and my husband are softies and we can't stand to listen to our baby boy cry. he's 16 months old and we're having a hard time keeping him in his crib. we have a bedtime routine, he'll sleep in his crib for maybe an hour or two and then he'll start crying and calling out for me. i try to soothe him without picking him up just talking, helping him lay down, rubbing is back.... 3 10 times he'll go back to sleep for another hour or two, but 7 10 times after an hour of trying to soothe him i give up, and bring him to bed with me because we all need to sleep. and while we do get some sleep with him in bed with us it's not the best...and the older he gets the more he kicks and squirms... i've tried sleeping in his room with him on an air mattress and then transitioning him to his crib and me out of the room but that basically had no success... he slept great while i was in the room but take me out of the room and he wakes up in a couple of hours. we are not a fan of the cry it out method... it's just too stressful for us and for him. are there any other ways of getting him to sleep on his own through the night without letting him cry?

help with a baby who only wants mom.	my husband and i have a four year old and a six month old. when my oldest was a baby he was an easy baby. he wasnt the least bit clingy and would only sleep when you put him in his bassinet or crib and walked away. we used to whine and wish he was more affectionate or like to snuggle or sleep on our chests. boy was that a be careful what you wish for situation. from day one, my youngest has insisted on being held 100% of the time and almost exclusively by me. if he sees me he screams until i pick him up. even if i leave him with my husband he screams until i get home. i have to hold him to get him to sleep and try my best not to wake him when i put him down. a lot of the time i have to sleep while holding him even though this makes me very nervous. my mom says ive spoiled him but ive done nothing different with him than i did with his brother. i know i should cherish this time and one day i will miss this, but sometimes i need to shower or do dishes or just play with my other son and i cant without him screaming the entire time. i know hes fine and theres no other reason for the crying because he stops as soon as i pick him up. his pediatrician even commented on how abruptly he quit crying when he handed him back to me. if it matters, he does go to daycare during the day. does anyone have any advice on getting your baby ok with not being held by you. i dont need him to be comfortable with everyone but letting his dad hold him for an extended period of time would be nice. hes six months old and it has been like this since day one.

how to talk sil mom to mom	i'm living with my mil's house with my husband and 4 month old. we are just here temporarily and will be gone after the new year. we normally live 9 hours away and only visit a few times a year. my sil livrs 10 minutes away and is over almost every day with her 3 kids . they are wild and can be a handful. my mil works full time and will rearrange her schedule and stress herself out to always be available to watch the sil's kids to the point where i feel like she is enabling. sil is a stay at home mom, but runs a small side business . i get needing mil to watch the kids every once and a while, but it really is getting to be a problem. we had all three kids overnight all weekend and they have been over long hours everyday since. she says oh i'll be gone 2 hours , but it ends up being 5. she doesn't call. she just assumes it is all okay. they other day she was so late mil missed her pt appointment to help recover from shoulder surgery she had a few weeks ago! mil won't say anything for fear of upseting sil and loosing the grandkids. i dont think sil is doing this on purpose. she is really a nice person, but she has been given what she asks for for so long that she has forgotten that grandma isnt an on call babysitter. i also feel like my child is being left out of grandma time because she is taking care of the other grandkids well past bed time and goes to work in the early morning. how can i approach this with sil? should i even bother? lots of mom-feelings involved here and i'm not sure how to navigate it.

nest cameras -- how to limit nanny's access?	we have several nest cameras setup throughout the inside and outside of the house and i just added another one to the baby's room. i want to give the nanny access to the baby's room footage but only that camera and only for the hours she's working at the house . i have an old phone that i have setup with the nest app for her to use as the baby monitor while at the house, but i don't see how to limit access to only one camera and only real-time footage . what if i setup with phone with a different email address ? is there a way to give limited access to a guest ? as much as i trust her, i don't feel comfortable with someone having access to 5 days worth of 24/7 surveillance of our personal in-home shenanigans. i could even see it as a potential sexual harassment lawsuit if she were to accidentally rewind too far back and see my husband running naked down the hall to get a towel or something... or god forbid us having alone time after the kids go to bed. i love nest and know a lot of people use them as nanny cams..... this has to have come up before? any help would be appreciated!

does anyone else's kids go into stroller trance? ...just mine?	so this has happened with both my children. when i put baby/toddler in the stroller. they just kind of stare forward with a blank look on their face. sometimes they will grab the sides of the stroller tray in front of them, but still no expression. no matter where we go, or what we see, nothing. when we've been going too long they will start to cry but not much babbling or reacting before that. if i take them out of the stroller they are their normal wiggly babbly selves. but they just go into what i call transportation mode in the stroller. though they don't act like this in the car seat, just the stroller. i'm always like are you okay? are you having any fun? i sometimes think they are asleep, but they aren't. it really becomes apparent when i am on walks with friends and their kids are trying to climb out, turning around, pointing and talking, asking for food, etc. and my kid is just being there. haha! does anyone else's kids do this. are my kids just weird? edit thanks everyone! i'm not concerned but it is nice to know my kids aren't the only ones. haha!	malaika_bustani	/r/Mommit/comments/ki0cge/does_anyone_elses_kids_go_into_stroller_trance/	6	11	0	1.0	1608620778.0

why do people think i care about their opinions on parenting?	my baby girl has chosen a plastic spider as her favourite toy. honestly she is supper difficult to keep entertained and if it keeps her quiet for ten minutes so i dont have to hold her im all for it. i had my girl in her pram playing with her spider and went to the shops to pick something up. some random woman stacking shelves at the store feels the need to comment oh so thats not dangerous or stupid to let your baby play with a toy spider so when she sees a real one shes gonna pick it up and shes gonna put it in her mouth, were okay with that? in a super aggressive tone directed at me i just laughed like it was a joke and kept on walking. my baby picks up everything and puts it in her mouth. i watch her all the time. id rather she not develop a fear of things. id also like to point out people seem to care more that she likes a toy spider when shes wearing pink than when shes wearing non gender specific clothes. sorry for the rant i just think if its someone elses child and they look happy healthy and are in no danger than mind your own damn business. im too tired to defend my daughters toys to you.

how long does it take to see results with famotidine in infants?	i have a 1 month on who has really bad acid reflux. we have changed formula 4 times and the formula helped a lot and made a difference but she was still suffering. no matter what we do sitting up/burping nothing is helping her. she still screams for hours. we spoke to my doctor and he prescribed her famotidine 2x a day. she has been on it for a full day. it helps her for about 6 hours and then she gets fussy again not as bad but shes still suffering. i know it takes time to work not going to work in one day but how long did it take for you to see results with the little one? she takes .5 2x a day at 12 45pm and am. i feel so bad when i give her the medicine shes great until about 6am/pm and then she starts to cry and eat more.

hey! could i have some advice?	hey, my names isabelle, but you guys can call me izzy and i made this reddit account today! but the reason i am posting this question is that we are having another baby boy . my husband and i already have three boys and a girl. but recently i was introduced to videos and websites about how circumcision is cruel and wrong and you should let your son decide for himself in the future or get him circumcised only if he has a medical problem; but all my other sons, christopher, zach and marcus are all circumcised and i dont know what to do! after watching the videos and reading about how cruel circumcision is, i decided to ask my boys. i knew it would be a weird conversation, but i wanted to know. so i asked my eldest, christopher does he remember his circumcision or hate me for having him circumcised, and he told me he doesnt remember a thing and that he loves being circumcised and is grateful that i got him circumcised. i also asked my second oldest, marcus and he is happy that he is circumcised and he doesnt remember getting circumcised. my youngest zach he doesnt care about anything but fortnight. but for those who are wondering what about my husbands views, my husband doesnt want our baby boy circumcised as he is the one that found the websites and videos of how cruel circumcision is. so what do i do? hopefully everyone is having a wonderful new year and hopefully everyone reading this is healthy and happy in 2021 edit1 - the reason i asked my boys is because i read online that boys can remember being circumcised		/r/Mommit/comments/koho57/hey_could_i_have_some_advice/	15	0	0	0.35	1609530557.0

when did you notice your baby start having less gas? and how much gas is normal?	my 2m old has always been super gassy. during the day, we deal with it by farting him after every feed . he wakes up fussy a lot at night and i can tell its gas because his cry starts off as grunting and he pulls his knees up to his chest before starting to kick and scream. the only way i can calm him down is laying him down on the bed next to me and applying pressure/rubbing his tummy and/or bicycling his legs and normally hell let a few rip. sometimes nursing works too. if i just sleep with him next to me and keep his legs propped up and start corrective measures as soon as i feel him tense up, hell sleep for 6-8 hrs. also, this is with him taking gas drops at literally every feed.	deviateddragon	/r/Mommit/comments/kpfoni/when_did_you_notice_your_baby_start_having_less/	8	2	0	1.0	1609656312.0

when did your periods go back to normal after pregnancy?	im 4 months and 3 weeks postpartum with my first baby. six weeks after he was born, i got my period back , and then got it right around the same date in october and november. then in december, i got my period like 3 or 4 days earlier than expected and it lasted for like 7-8 days instead of my usual 5. it was really weird, because the previous 2 periods were a ~30 day cycle and this one was like 26 days or something like that . i know im probably over exaggerating, but before i got pregnant, i was always one of those people whose period was like clockwork, so this feels off to me. i guess im also just impatient for my body to go back to normal. did anyone else have a similar experience? thank you in advance.

i know i want one more, partner not so sure anymore	as the title says, i've always known i wanted more than one kid. i have two siblings and while i could have lived without my brother, i would die without my sister. she is absolutely my favorite person in the world that i can go to with anything. i want that for my daughter too. my baby is only almost 5 months old so i'm not trying to get pregnant right now but i know its something i will want in a year or two. the problem is that my partner, while he used to be on board with multiple kids because he loves having a sister too, has now changed his mind. our baby is not the most difficult but there are obviously very trying days. her sleep is not yet good and it's taking its toll. usually i do all her night wake ups and then when she is up for the day he gets her and i get to sleep for a couple hours. he gets so irritable though and has discovered he has terrible anxiety over loud noises, especially her crying. every morning he rants about how he will never do this again, will never put himself through this again, and she is going to be his only child. he loves her and is grateful to be a dad, but is not having a good time parenting and it's harder than he thought it would be. he says if i want another one i will have to leave him and have someone else's baby. i listen patiently and tell myself when the time comes we can have a conversation about it. but it sucks to hear him say these things everyday when i know i want another one. yes it's hard, but i would do it all again in a heartbeat to give my baby a sibling. if your still reading thank you. anyone been through something similar? how did it work out for you? all advice welcome.

kindergarten virtual learning advice	hey moms- thanks in advance for reading and any comments/suggestions you might have. my 6 year old son started kindergarten this year, virtually of course, and at the start we had a small learning pod going with a tutor. my husband and i both work full time and also have a 3 year old. the tutor got too expensive so we had to stop that but, during that time, the tutor would occasionally comment on how my sons teacher was kind of unsympathetic to the kids and a little too strict . now, i completely understand and sympathize with how difficult it must be to teach this age group virtually and i applaud the effort of trying to get kids learning and on a schedule, etc. so i didn't take it too seriously. i know this is as difficult for the teachers as it is for the kids. but today , my son was 5 minutes late to his first class. finishing breakfast and then had trouble logging in. when he finally got in, his teacher made a point of stopping the entire class and called him out saying, your 5 minutes laaaaaate, kindergarten starts at 8 25 kids, was late and that's not acceptable for anyone. my son, who is extremely shy and particularly hates attention, was incredibly upset to the point of near tears. my sister was livid with her tone and almost called her out in front of the whole class. just about 20 minutes later, my sister witnessed her calling out another child who needed to use the bathroom after returning from a 5 minute break by telling him it was sad that he needed to use the restroom right after they had just had a break. now, i would normally maybe brush this off a bit- again, i totally get the notion of getting these kids on a schedule and learning as if they were physically in school- but the prior comments from the tutor along with this have really upset me. they are 5 and 6 year olds, trying to do school remotely in front of a computer. i think calling out young children in this way is damaging and disappointing. she doesn't seem fit to be a teacher of children this age; or maybe it's just too stressful doing the remote thing. either way, i don't want me son equating school to this negative experience. he's so smart but i'm afraid this could have a lasting impact. i'm really looking for advice- what would you do in this situation? i don't have much hope that they will go to in-person learning this year and i'm also pretty certain i wouldn't want my son staying in her class anyway. i'm considering sending her an email, and then the principal an email, and unenrolling him. kindergarten isn't a required grade in our area and my son is ahead for his age. as a substitute, i would look to home school on our own time with less pressure. this whole vitual learning is just so difficult, i sympathize with teacher but i also think she needs to extend the same.	hiitsjenna	/r/Mommit/comments/krpdh5/kindergarten_virtual_learning_advice/	2	3	0	0.81	1609944907.0

we did it wrong. we will never sleep again. i need help.	okay, so we have a 7 month old who currently sleeps in a pack-n-play in our room anyway, he started rolling over, back to front, about 3 months ago. he rolls over all day, has not laid on his back since the day he figured it out. we struggle with most tasks . we took him out of the swaddle immediately, bc you just never know. but, we realized that he couldnt sleep without it. so instead of the swaddle, we went to the merlin sleep suit. that worked great for 1.5 months then, he rolled over in it while we were not at home for a few nights. great. that night we kept him out of the suit, used a sleep sack. however, he hated it because even in his sleep, he could just not figure out how to lay down without rolling over and waking himself up. here is where i made the mistake, he liked the weight of the suit, it really helps him sleep and stay still . so, to keep him kind of positioned in the suit, i used his boppy lounger to lay him on, to keep him from rolling, laying down and comfortable while he sleeps. in the pack-n-play. he is starting to get too big for the suit, and he needs to get adjusted for when i do feel comfortable transitioning him in the crib. for over a week now, we have tried to do the sleep sack at night. he tosses and turns all night, rolling around in the pack-n-play. he will be in a deep sleep, move ever so slightly and wake himself up. and goes immediately to hands and knees position, ive seen him do it with his eyes closed still. after about 5 nights of 12 hours of sleep total, i work during the day, and get night shift with the baby, i caved. putting him right back in the sleep suit with the lounger till i can figure out something else to get him back into sleep mode. i really want to figure out another way, i just dont know what we should do. any suggestions? please dont cast judgement, im doing the best i can with the energy i have. help. edit format.	lovesickpirate	/r/Mommit/comments/ksu8sg/we_did_it_wrong_we_will_never_sleep_again_i_need/	9	1	0	0.6	1610077083.0

how did you know you wanted a second lo?	i had my first in oct 2020. she's wonderful and beautiful and a lot of work. before we decided to start our family we thought we would have at most 2 children a few years or so apart. now after my first, i find myself panicky or overwhelmed sometimes when she wont stop fussing or wont go down for her nap. and i'll seriously think that this is is, just one! she's 3 months on the 10th and i know as she grows it might get easier but these first 3 months have been hard. i decided to he a sahm because i am lucky enough to be able to give her that support and i want to be there for every thing. but the bad days i just cry as she's crying while i rock and cuddle her. and sometimes i have thoughts of just handing her to my husband and leaving, going no where in particular - thinking about how my life before was so much easier and simple. but if i don't have another one, i can't stop thinking about how bored she might be on family trips. i had so much fun with my little sister on trips, even though we fought a lot. even now, we still speak every day and i don't want to deprive my lo of that. i just keep thinking about the baby blues, the lack of sleep, and anxiety that came with my lo. does it get easier? is having a second child harder than the first? what have you found is a good gap between the two? thank you. i just needed to get my thoughts out there.

a miracle happened last night my 11 month old who has only ever been nursed or rocked to sleep for his whole life, fell asleep on his own!	i am feeling a huge weight off my shoulders - the one that tells you that you're creating bad habits and they'll never be able to sleep on their own. he's starting dayhome soon and the lady who runs it asked us to work on him being able to fall asleep, and it's been giving me so much anxiety. well the last 1.5 months the little guy has been waking up every night an hour after put down, and then again an hour later screaming bloody murder until i would lie down in bed with him . he then continued to wake up every 45 mins-1.5 hours to nurse back to sleep. it's been like having a newborn. he's also been fighting/arching his back against being rocked by my husband to sleep, so i've had to nurse him down every night. this succccccked because the evening used to be my few hours to myself while my husband handled bath and bedtime. i've felt very scared about sleep training because all the attachment parenting advocates say you're child will change their attachment to you and never be happy again, and i've been scared not to sleep train because everyone else says you're messing up your baby's natural ability to sleep if you nurse to sleep. well friends, we decided our baby was showing cues to wanting to sleep on his own...and guess what?! he obviously did! we put him in his crib awake, and did the 'sleep wave'... but didn't really have to do it because he was asleep within 15 minutes . i thought i might have to be up every hour putting him back down , but no! he slept in three hour increments all night. i nursed him before i went to bed, and two other times. each time he fell asleep on his own in under 5 minutes. what sorcery is this? i only got 6.5 hours of sleep but damn do i feel rested. a couple solid 3 hour chunks of sleep on my own?! i also think he might drop some nursings because he barely drank last night... his sleep has been a huge source of insecurity for me but guess what?! he's fine?! now i wonder if we shoulda tried sooner ... had to post my success story because i've read so many and always wondered if that could ever be my family... moral of the story- it never hurts to try different things if your current pattern isn't working. you never know what will!!! edit night 2 he was asleep within 5 minutes, whimpered for about 1 minute. woke up for 2 feeds. after one he on and off whimpered/cried for an hour. like whimper/cry out, try to settle, repeat. night 3 asleep in 10 minutes, woke up for one feed. night 4 asleep in 2 mins, slept 11 hours night 5 asleep fast again, slept 8.5 hours, feed at 4 am or something, back down to 630 night 6 slept 11 hours night 7 slept 10.5 hours pretty amazing. he was obviously ready to sleep on his own if he dropped those feeds so fast and began sleeping so long!$3	Comprehensive-Ad7538	/r/Mommit/comments/ku0rwg/a_miracle_happened_last_night_my_11_month_old_who/	26	115	0	0.98	1610230606.0

crap naps , i do not know what to do!	hej! i am completely lost right now. after christmas my 5 month old baby has lost any ability to have a normal nap during daytime. she would usually have 3 naps, 2 of them aprox 50 min, 1 of them about 1.5h. all of a sudden, she wants to start the day at 5 am instead of 7, is really hard to get down some of the times and we are lucky if we get 35 min. i have tried everything i could think of- making the room dark, white noise, feeding her until she falls back asleep. it all seems to be a hit or a miss. she usually wakes up, starts tu fuss until i pick her up, then gets cranky in 30 min because she is tired. only thing that somewhat works is walking around with a stroller, so she naps in the stroller. but it is january in the baltics and it is going to get really cold, i do not want her to get sick! to note- she did have her 4 month regression and we had a wonderfull 1 of good sleeping habits. she does not require rocking or feeding to sleep, sleeps in her own bed. wake time is 2 hours and bed time is from 6.30 to 7. i am so lost right now, due to covid i have noone to help since my husband is busy with work and finishing mba and we live alone. i am at a point where my life just feels like a constant battle and a loop. do you have any advise?	laurabjork	/r/Mommit/comments/kuzpc4/crap_naps_i_do_not_know_what_to_do/	3	4	0	0.84	1610358978.0
help - advice about having another kid	my husband and i recently had our second child. we always talked about having two. both my children are boys and i love them dearly, but am really struggling with the idea of never having a girl. - our house would be tight with another kid - kids are expensive and money would be tight with another kid - i very well could have another boy - i dont enjoy being pregnant or the fourth trimester phase - my work involves travel, and a third would make that even more difficult - you have to go from man-to-man to always being on zone defense all of these very logical reasons to say im done and yet i cant bring myself to stop thinking about it...all the things i will be missing, all the mother-daughter moments and that special relationship. my husband says he is on board with whatever decision i make - he doesnt feel the need for another but if i really want to, hes on board. has anyone else been in a similar situation? i dont have anyone to talk to about this and looking for some honest opinions. thank you!	357910	/r/Mommit/comments/kvi2o9/help_advice_about_having_another_kid/	5	2	0	0.75	1610417938.0
anyone else barely surviving and want another mom to talk to?	i'm a first time mom to a 6 month old. i also have a 1 year old lab whose as much, if not more work, than the baby. my husband works all the time and when he isn't working he's having to isolate in a seperate room through the week to avoid giving us covid as we're in a covid hotspot and he works in a factory with 300-1000 other people each day. everyday i wish i was the one working even though i don't really wish that because i'm scared of covid. but i just want to run away a lot of the time. i'm so stressed and exhausted and i never get to eat a hot meal or take a bath or so anything i want. i love my son so so much, he's honestly a very sweet happy baby. he just cries a lot, which is what teething babies do. it's not his fault. like i said, i love him, but i'm just not one of those moms who finds playing with the baby fun. i still do it, i want him to have a happy childhood and develop on track, but i'm pretty unhappy. i really would love having someone to talk to who understands 	vilebubbles	/r/Mommit/comments/kvt1tv/anyone_else_barely_surviving_and_want_another_mom/	34	19	0	0.95	1610463015.0
why does no one tell you before kids?	today i realized that no one shares important information about our bodies with us before we have kids that will drastically change after you have them. even if its tmi mine is my periods. ive always had a hard time with it being extremely heavy and almost debilitating. to the point that i am one of those people that has to wear the heaviest absorbing tampon i can find and a pad and still change out every hour or so. my mom knows this, she has the same issue its always been a thing... but no one bothered to give a heads up that it was going to get worse with every child i had. now i have two kids, thankfully thats all i wanted; i think if i had another i would be on the verge of bleeding out every month with the amount i lose. is this normal? i thought, especially with the birth control im on, that my periods wouldnt be so bad anymore. let alone a solid week of carrie level horror.	dinkdink--	/r/Mommit/comments/kvx8am/why_does_no_one_tell_you_before_kids/	45	29	0	1.0	1610475562.0

i never realized just how amazing something as simple as having a nightly/daily self care routine could really be, and i love it.	i apologise for the long title, but oh. my. god. also, mobile, so formatting sucks. so, for christmas, i messaged my sil, asking if she had any advice about skin care/beauty regiments, that sort of thing. so what does she do? she loads one whole bag full of beauty products and two or three different moisturizers. like, i have enough to last me for the next five to six months. and i'll tell you, as a full time stay at home mom who cleans endlessly, having just a small change to my daily routine did wonders to my mental health. now, i've decided to go even further, and have cut soda out of my diet completely, and i even began to eat healthier too. if i'm going to start taking care of one part of my body, i might as well take care of the rest of it too. i want to be able to keep up with my daughter as she gets older. i want to be healthy and energetic, so that i can run and play, and enjoy my time with her , without feeling like i can't keep up because i didn't take care of myself along the way. and it doesn't hurt that by doing this myself, it will set a good example for them. if you want an update post, let me know, and i'll try to remember!	chaoticXmermaid	/r/Mommit/comments/kwaxr8/i_never_realized_just_how_amazing_something_as/	3	5	0	1.0	1610519806.0

moms of 3 year olds what are your nap schedules? do your 3 year olds take naps still?	my 3 year old gets up around 5 30 am so by noon she is ready to take a nap. and boy does she nap. from 12 00-2 30 she sleeps hard and i wake her up at 2 30. im sure she would sleep well past 3 00 if i let her. but she doesnt fall asleep at night until after 9 00 even though shes in bed by 7 00. this is a new problem. last year she was napping and falling asleep around 7 30-8 00. before i had her i was a preschool teacher and worked in the 3 year old classroom so i have a lot of experience with different kind of napping habits but not being there with my students at night, i never knew the impact their naps had with bedtime. im thinking about implanting quiet time in her room rather than naps but she sleeps so hard during her naps i feel she needs them. i am not moving her bedtime to a later time. i go to bed around 9 00-10 00 and i need a second to myself before i go to bed.

when to start teaching little ones about appropriate/inappropriate touch?	my biggest fear as a mom is my children getting sexually abused. last night i watched athlete a on nextflix and the fact that a doctor sexually abused hundreds of girls, some literally in front of their parents who couldnt see or on camera is just absolutely terrifying. i also have a friend who is like a sister who was sexually abused by her older cousin when she was 5 years old. she didnt know at that age that what was happening was wrong, she was just told by her cousin that it was a secret game and of course she believed her. how early have you/would you start teaching your young kids what is appropriate/inappropriate? my oldest is only almost 2 so she definitely doesnt understand that kind of stuff yet, but i was thinking about maybe around 3 when you would probably also start introducing stranger danger. but is that too early? i dont want to scare her, but at the same time i never want anything like that to happen to her. i want her to know whats right and whats wrong so that if someone ever does try then she would know to come forward immediately. maybe im just too paranoid but gosh, just thinking about it makes me want to puke.

body after babies is seriously affecting my self esteem and my relationship with my partner. anyone have any help/suggestions/advice?	i had twins last year. before that i was always a curvy girl but i loved my body. no matter how much weight i gained i always rocked the cutest outfits and did my makeup well and i felt fierce. i was that plus size girl wearing clothes that flattered my body and had no desire to hide my figure or fade into the background. now, i cannot stand my body. i carried twins to term , i had/have diastasis recti and the babies were born via c-section. i've also gained weight after they were born because i don't have time to work out and it's hard eating healthy when i barely have time to eat proper meals in the first place . my belly is unrecognizable to me. my husband doesn't seem to mind, but i am repulsed when he touches me. i don't understand how anyone can be attracted to me. i still think he's gorgeous but i can't look at myself in the mirror. none of my clothes look good because of the extra skin. i hate being naked. all i see is my saggy belly. i know other women go through this.... please give me any advice you have on how to love myself again, any tips/tricks on getting my body back, or anything wisdom you might have so i can move forward with my new body and love who i am now - not who i wish i was still.	fluffagus	/r/Mommit/comments/kxbai7/body_after_babies_is_seriously_affecting_my_self/	4	7	0	1.0	1610648276.0

co-parenting struggles, looking for advice or words of encouragement	covid hit our family pretty hard. my husband was laid off at the beginning and hasnt been back to work. ive been working from home. hes been our 18m sons primary care giver while i work from the start. ive been catching a lot of lazy and poor parenting. he spaces on brushing his teeth every day. hes got sesame street or teletubbies turned on for large portions of the day. his excuse is typically that son was upset and it calms him down. he doesnt clean up. he insists he needs a nap every day when baby goes down. its driving me crazy. he started school this week, so i found a babysitting to come one afternoon a week so he can get a jump start on school. except i learned right before she arrived that he intends to nap every week when the babysitter gets here. i feel like im married and parenting with a complete freeloader. at least with a babysitter, i could correct some of this behavior or find a better one. im cooking every meal, im doing most of the cleaning. im having a hard time seeing why i wouldnt be better off as a single parent who gets child support payments. ugh, okay. maybe this is mostly a rant i needed to get off my chest, but how do i fix this?! signed, wife of rip van winkle	sanctusali	/r/Mommit/comments/ky3b3p/coparenting_struggles_looking_for_advice_or_words/	11	10	0	0.82	1610743194.0
my husband has post-natal depression. how can i help him? ;_;	hi moms, mummys, mamas, mas... having been told that we couldn't have children naturally together, hubby and i made our peace with the fact and never went down the ivf route. so imagine our surprise when 16 years later we discovered we were expecting. my husband had been caring for his extremely unwell and suicidal dad for 3.5yrs before he passed away, 1 month before our son arrived perfectly healthy and happy. i was hit by post-natal depression and ptsd straight away, and my husband had no time at all to process losing his dad, his son arriving, and watching his wife go through pnd. by the time i was finally coming out of it , my husband was utterly broken. i'm really struggling to know how to help him process everything that's happened and also bond with our son, who he loves very much. i don't find a lot of material out there to help men with pnd, but he definitely has it, along with bereavement and a panic disorder that's reared its head. it's so frustrating to talk to people about how things are at home with us. people judge so very quickly and assume he's some kind of lazy dad who doesn't know or care to bond with his son. but i know the exact opposite is the truth. he is utterly overwhelmed with anxiety, depression, grief and self-loathing, while at the same time fighting suicidal thoughts, and desperately wishing he could be the father and husband he wants to be. it doesn't help to have people dropping passive aggressive comments against him, so i've been trying very hard to buffer him from these. but it's taking its toll on me, too. but i'll be fine - it's him i'm worried about. do any of you have experiences with husband/partners who experienced pnd? how did you overcome it? did you...? what helped? what didn't...? thanks for your time, and for understanding. p.s. our son is fine and healthy at 15 months old. he's utterly perfect in every way, very happy, lucky enough to have his grandparents and uncle nearby .

any advice appreciated	hey guys, i just need some advice as im stuck on a situation with my baby daddy. he and i had no romantic relationship before we had a baby together but have known each other since high school. im 24 and our baby is almost 2 years old. the father hasnt talked to us in over a year and a half because we got into an argument and he didnt once reach out to check how hes doing. i reached out one day after a year and a half of no contact to ask if he can babysit as it was an emergency and he said sure. a week after we sat down to talk to move on further with their father son relationship. he said he wanted to take him every other weekend and its been almost 2 months since hes talked to us so im guessing he doesnt want to commit to a full relationship with him. he has an 18 year old girlfriend now which makes me very uncomfortable but i know i gotta suck it up and accept it. my sons been super attached to him since that one weekend they spent together and has been going around calling every male we see daddy and it breaks my heart that his father doesnt want to be a stable part of his life. i even texted him asking for his address and he hasnt texted back and now its been a month since. instead i see him posting cringy tik toks with his girlfriend and it really aggravates me. i am planning on filing child support soon but for now should i reach out to him again? i did once in the last two months of no contact and he still hasnt changed his behavior of being absent. and also do you guys have any advice for court? such as what information to gather, how to prepare etc.	nmdtd	/r/Mommit/comments/kzmrtk/any_advice_appreciated/	2	1	0	1.0	1610942933.0

being healthy, ftm looking for advice!	how do you guys handle the stress of a baby and being healthy. i am a ftm with an amazing son. he is almost 3 months and he's perfect. but i am stressed and tired and had a c section. im not 100% but feel way better than the first couple weeks. i eat like crap because i don't really get him out of my arms for longer than 10-30 minutes while his dad works. i can barely go to the bathroom and refill my water most days. sandwiches, chips, cookies and brownies, casserole type dishes that last a couple days and i eat that for all meals etc. things that need no work to assemble and eat is what i've been living on. very carb heavy which doesn't keep me full long, plus while breastfeeding i feel freaking ravenous at all times. i have cut out soda! only water and coffee from here on out until i can figure out how to get the other aspects of my life healthier. i also stopped buying chips and switched to carrots which is working pretty well i want to be healthy for my son. i don't really care how i look up to an extent, i know getting healthy will change my appearance but i mainly just want to live a long life for my son. is it just too early to worry about this so much? i know as he gets older it will get easier to get time to myself how do you guys handle this? i don't think meals made on sunday will be good/last until friday, but i may be wrong! thanks in advance for reading! we are very isolated trying to keep baby healthy amid these crazy times and these online forums are my saving grace and connection to other moms lol.	newmommy2020	/r/Mommit/comments/l1ei49/being_healthy_ftm_looking_for_advice/	12	1	0	1.0	1611165560.0
need some advice, baby at the beach	ftm here, due early june. how feasible do you actually think it is to bring a baby that's about 1 month old to the beach on a boat. my family has always gone boating, and even brought me when i was 3 months old. because my family brought me when i was so young, they seem to think that it will be normal for me to bring the 1-month-old and go about our plans as they always have been. normally we plan our dates around this time, so that everyone who wants to be there can mark their calendars and so we can reserve motel rooms. i'm totally clueless on how difficult this might be, but when i read reddit posts of new moms, it seems like they're overwhelmed enough with just trying to get through day to day life, let alone such a big change in the routine. i just am looking for some advice.	bitewingdings	/r/Mommit/comments/l1gqbv/need_some_advice_baby_at_the_beach/	11	0	0	0.5	1611171674.0

how to transition 2 year old to a big bed	my son just turned 2. he's at the very top of the growth charts and getting way to big for his crib. i'm thinking of skipping putting the toddler rail on his bed and just transitioning him to a full size bed on the floor. when he lays on his back there are only about 3 inches from his feet and head to the ends of the crib. i have a really hard time visualizing how this is going to go. i want to see if anyone here can give me some guidance. he slept in a sidecar crib/bedshared with me until he was about 13 months. at that point it wasn't working for either of us and we decided to transition him into a crib in his own room. that went well, it took a couple of weeks of me rocking him back to sleep multiple times but he started sleeping all the way through the night soon after. right now i rock and nurse him to sleep in a rocking chair and then put him into his crib after he falls asleep. it takes about 45ish minutes and i don't mind that. he loves his crib. he is a wild sleeper. he rolls around a ton and ends up upsidedown or horizonal a few different times during the night. we haven't given him a blanket yet because of this, he currently sleeps in a sleep sack. he will randomly stand up in the middle of the night holding on to the sides of the crib, then walk to the other end of the bed and lay back down. i'm afraid it's going to be too much change at once. new bed, new sleep suit or a blanket, no more crib sides to keep him contained, new freedom to roam in the room. we're going to be moving in about 6 months and i don't want to take the crib with us. i would also really like to wean soon, but i'm not sure if i should do that before or after we get a new bed. should i just make all the changes at once or should i gradually spread them out? should i continue rocking him and putting him into the new bed when he's asleep? maybe just wait until we move and do the new bed at the same time? ideally at the end of all the change, i would like to lay with him in bed for bedtime and either read to him or talk/sing/rub his back/whatever to get him to sleep. my son doesn't do very well with change. i'm just afraid of messing up his sleep. he's been sleeping 11 hours straight at night and taking 2.5 hour naps for the past few months. i know there is a big shift between 2 and 2.5, so maybe if i wait for a while it will be easier. i'm just not sure what to do.	distraction_queen	/r/Mommit/comments/l1lsil/how_to_transition_2_year_old_to_a_big_bed/	3	3	0	0.81	1611186293.0
3+ moms, tell me what you drive!	context kids 20 weeks along with 3, 2 is 13 months in rear facing convertible, 1 is two and a half in rear facing convertible me we live in northeast usa so lots of snow and ice in the winter. i work in healthcare, though we are currently work from home until the foreseeable future and its been all but said we will permanently be wfh at least part time when the world is right side up. the thing is we dont close for weather, every week day my kids need to get to my moms and i would either work from there or go to the office. we live in a fairly suburban area, her neighborhood can be tough in the snow and often not plowed until the day after storms unless they are a doozy or a neighbor with a plow feels generous. my commute to her house is 2.5 miles through town and my commute to work is 9 miles via highway. husband trying to force a silverado to work. i drove one before we had kids because i had two horses that required trailering, large hay loads and feed store runs. i have no desire to drive a pick up again so he can have it in a few years when hes done working on the road. he has turned down the idea of a mini van because they arent great in the snow and makes the argument having three seats across in a silverado will be easier than having to get our oldest into a third row of an suv even with a walk through second row. i also take issue that apparently the silverado only has two seats with a latch system and the middle seat doesnt have a headrest 2 part question am i crazy that the silverado isnt a feasible/smart option and give me some alternative suggestions please 	jmt20180601	/r/Mommit/comments/l1uy63/3_moms_tell_me_what_you_drive/	12	1	0	1.0	1611220389.0

any new moms having a hard time getting out of the house these days ? as much as i want to and would actually love to, the thought is quite overwhelming.	i've always been one to take forever to get dressed, so doing this for two bodies is quite honestly a lot. but it's not just that. i've got this habit of becoming overwhelmed at just the thought of something and as a result, will simply choose to not do it at all to avoid the dread that i'm expecting will come with pursuing it. and so on days that i want to just do something simple and covid-safe like run a quick errand and then sit in the car in some sun and work on the laptop a bit, here's the overwhelm that sets in i tell myself that getting me dressed, getting her dressed, ensuring the diaper bag is well packed, making the long walk to the car from my apartment with the stroller, having to touch so many doors to get there and therefore having to sanitize my hands/steering wheel/etc when i get in the car, having to do the stroller fold and stuff into trunk routine, knowing that at some point once or twice i'll have to deal with a public restroom with a baby, then eventually have to find a good parking spot or end up with a long walk back to the apartment -- is just too much. so then another week and a half of staying at home, missing out on sun, fun, and civilization. pre-baby, i always hated how long it took me to get dressed and leave the house but i was at least motivated to do it, even if it meant not getting out until late afternoon. now, it's like if it weren't for errands, i'd never leave. then the fact that i don't feel as pretty as i did pre-baby...that doesn't help. . anyone else struggling with this?	ughatsocialmedia	/r/Mommit/comments/l3euxq/any_new_moms_having_a_hard_time_getting_out_of/	11	6	0	1.0	1611418230.0

how to get rid of wrinkly stretchmarks?	not the actual mark, i don't care about that, but when i bend or stand in a certain way the skin looks somewhat puckered. i don't understand why. with my first pregnancy i gained less than 14lbs and with my second i gained no weight at all, and i had tiny bumps. i am 132lbs and 5 6.5 so don't understand the issue here. i've researched it and it seems dermaroller of 0.5-1mm combined with a topical retinol and chemical exfoliant is the best way to go. has anyone had any success with this? and if so do you recommend any specific products? i'm aware this is a minor issue and mine aren't that bad objectively. i'm just looking to improve their appearance and wondered if anyone else had done so.

my little girl broke my heart when she waved at some other kids playing on the park.	my little girl is a few weeks off her 3rd birthday and is now old enough and aware enough to be affected by the continuing lockdown restrictions in the uk. this time last year she was attending several baby groups a week plus meeting up with friends at soft play areas regularly. now it's home every day with mummy with the occasional walk/park trip with a friend if restrictions allow. everytime we go anywhere, which is just a half hour walk round the village these days, she seeks out other children to be her friends. she runs up to them on the street or on parks or anywhere we see other people and i have to explain to her that she can't hug/kids/interact with them. i have had a few parents tut and drag their child away in disgust as she runs towards them with her arms stretched wide for a hug. i think she's now starting to realise that things aren't normal and has stopped being so friendly when we're out. today we were walking through a park on our daily walk where 2 young girls were playing. my little girl waved at them and turned round to me and said i wish i had friends mummy . it absolutely broke me. i know things are hopefully heading in the right direction again back to having some sort of normal life again, but in the meantime it's heartbreaking to hear my little girl wish for friends once again. in the uk the big issue at the minute is getting children back to school and school age children are discussed frequently in updates. the little ones too young for school seem to be totally forgotten by everyone. there's no talk of opening playgroups or the need for preschool groups to be open. it feels like the needs of preschool age are not important. yes, i appreciate they aren't important in the grand scheme of things, but surely somebody somewhere needs to speak out on behalf of the younger generation before it's too late. edit.... just feel the need to say i'm so overwhelmed by everyone's kind comments and i've even had a few offers for virtual playdays which had been amazing! my heart goes out to all my fellow parents out there going through this right now and to all those toddlers desperate for friends. i've shed a few tears this evening reading about comments they've made and the waving at strangers. hugs to all. i'll try to reply to all tomorrow	StitchConverse	/r/Mommit/comments/l7wupk/my_little_girl_broke_my_heart_when_she_waved_at/	135	455	0	0.98	1611937686.0

how to connect with toddler	hello mommas! i'm a single mom to a wonderful 19month old. my son is in daycare during the day and i work full time. our weeks consist of very little quality time. we wake up and get ready for the day. then we are apart from 7 30am-4 30pm. we get home by 5pm. i make dinner, we eat, then there's a small chunk of time between 6-7pm that i have to consciously remind myself to use for quality time with my son. my brain is stuck in work/chores mode. all day i'm either cooking, cleaning, or working and for that little hour of time that i can do anything with my son i find myself not knowing what to do. by default i do chores around the house and then i remember i can do those things after he goes to bed. sometimes i just get so sad because i feel like i have no idea how to connect with him. he's learning so much from strangers at his daycare and not from me. they engage him and play with him and i feel completely lost when i'm left to my own devices. i've attempted a few sensory activities, but they end up overwhelming me because it just adds more to my pile of things to plan & clean. right now we mostly just wrestle and read books. i try to play with his toys with him but he's never really interested when i do this. any tips on how to connect with a toddler more? there are times when i feel like we are literally soulmates and we are deeply connected. but the times i don't feel connected seem to be increasing. idk if it's just in my head?	arzeNaed	/r/Mommit/comments/laeprn/how_to_connect_with_toddler/	16	24	0	0.92	1612214987.0

unsure how to handle this situation with another mom	so, we have a four-year-old girl and there's an almost five-year-old boy two doors down. the first few times the kids played together the boy wouldn't play well and would share things they found outside to play with and everything ended in tears with him going home for a timeout. recently my daughter has wanted to play with him again and we have started doing occasional mask playdates outside. it was mostly good with few minor issues. my daughter is a fairly independent player and just plays near the little boy. the last two times, we've had a playdate, though, the other mom has stayed inside the whole time. i felt unsure and guilty the first time but she's also sent her son outside to play by himself multiple times. i didn't really know what to do and am very conflict adverse. i let them play about an hour and my husband came out. he saw the other mom looking through the window, so she knew we were all out there, but wouldn't come out herself. the second time, i asked the boy where his mom was and to go get her. he ran inside for a minute and came back saying he had to wait. she'd seen us, said hi, and got him ready to come outside, but refused to come out herself. how do i handle this without blowing up the relationship with my neighbor?	babutterfly	/r/Mommit/comments/lfmgcm/unsure_how_to_handle_this_situation_with_another/	3	3	0	0.81	1612819947.0
weaning helping. how to fall asleep on her own?	edit i didnt want to start night weaning yet. i wanted to do this during the day when she tries to take a late nap and weekends when she wont stay off me but it would wash away completely. so now if anyone has a weaning plan suggestion or can remind me the general method of weaning? i, most importantly, dont want her cut off cold turkey and also dont want to get engorged. i got this product called suckbuster. its a balm you put on the nipples and makes them bitter. i used it at nap time and worked perfect. i tried to wash it off for bedtime but its too strong! now she wont take the boob tonight and cant fall asleep. she is 2 years. im rocking and singing and rubbing and patting. shes asking to eat for an excuse to get up. she refuses the boob even when i offer and its very vague smell and taste now. any soothing tips?	hardoutheretobunique	/r/Mommit/comments/lft7ut/weaning_helping_how_to_fall_asleep_on_her_own/	4	1	0	1.0	1612840285.0

what wonder weeks? lo has micro-leaps every couple of days.	we were gifted the wonder weeks book and it made me pretty anxious about my daughters developmental leap patterns. she wasnt following the prescribed schedule, and i was preemptively dreading the famed regression phases. as a ftm, it initially just made me frustrated at my baby for being her unique, perfect, growing self. theres an nyt article that said basically a lot of scientists dont agree with the premise of 10 leaps. lots of babies have smaller leaps more often. my parents shared a chinese saying with me that i feel fits my daughters development so much better 3 cat days and 3 dog days to describe babies cycling quickly between smooth and fussy days. this fits my daughters patterns so much better than expecting weeks of calm! i feel so much more relaxed and prepared to just soak it in. cherish the good days and snuggle my way through the fussy ones. it will all pass. shes growing up too fast already.	puresunlight	/r/Mommit/comments/lh3ivy/what_wonder_weeks_lo_has_microleaps_every_couple/	9	12	0	1.0	1612990270.0

in need of advice family vacation drama	so before i start this post. i am fully aware of the pandemic and all that has happened. we are prepared to cancel the trip if things arent cleared up by then. weve been planning this trip for a long time now. and already have cancelled events due to covid. sorry for the disclaimer but i wanted to write it before people focus on the wrong aspect of this post. i am a proud mama to an 8 month old boy and he is my pride and joy. i have spent literally every single day with him and have never been with out him. i unfortunately was diagnosed with severe postpartum anxiety, and for those who dont know what that is its like the distant cousin to pd in the same ballpark but not the same at all. the vacation is in another state and my so has planned for 8 days of vacation there. i am excited to do something other than stay quarantined as i have been home literally since the beginning of the pandemic, however i do not like the ideology of leaving my son behind. now the issue is, i dont trust his mother and he doesnt trust mine so we cant leave the baby with either one of them. they both truthfully have proven to be untrustworthy with our son and we cannot agree on which parent to leave him with. i personally would love to take my kid with me, i know hed be in the safest care and it would ease my anxiety a little bit. we are bumping heads on the matter because he feels like the baby being with us would ruin our time there because we would be limited on activities. i had tried explaining to him that leaving the baby behind would result in me not having a good time. i had offered to my so a middle ground where i would go with him for 3-4 days and then return back and he can stay the remainder of the days with our friends who are also attending. he found that to be problematic and now is just saying we should cancel the trip entirely although the airbnb is already paid for. what can i do? i feel like im stuck between a rock and a hard place.

how can friends help with your social life?	my cousin is my closest friend i have since we were 6. we talked every day and we always hanged out regularly, we are 32 now. our husbands have grown to be best buddies. it all changed when she had her baby in july. it seemed like she kept up with social life. for the next few months she would still invite us over, we would bring food, she would ask if we wanted to go out to eat, we would invite her over, etc. maybe shes overwhelmed and isnt telling me, but she isnt talking to me anymore. if i try to start conversation it would be really short but i know she isnt mad at me. its just like weve grown apart completely. i understand shes busy and we cant see eachother as much but she barely talks to me now. is it harder on women? my husband and her husband seemed to still connect. they text almost every day, in their free time they hangout, even when he has the baby he comes over with the baby. i dont understand why men seem to be able to keep their lives while it seems most women grow apart and with other moms. has anyone grown back close? how can i help? i did plan on trying to conceive later this year as my husband and i have planned, i wonder if will become like her and maybe understand why.

advice for adjusting to 2 kids?	we have a 3.5 year old daughter and a 7 week old son and i'm struggling to adjust to 2 kids without feeling inadequate or guilty about dividing my time between them. any advice for balancing newborn needs with preschooler needs ? thankfully my daughter has been good to little bro, but often takes her frustrations out on us and has more tantrums. 3.5 year old was a super easy baby except for sleep struggles until 4 months old, something that caused me a ton of anxiety... i knew what to expect this time around but still stress about how the heck to get my son down for a nap without leaving my daughter alone or sitting in front of the tv for too long! why do babies fight naps... arg! he is also not nearly as easy lol. i don't mind going for a walk/car ride or putting him in the baby wrap sometimes, but i don't want to rely on that for all his naps... i want him to learn good sleep habits and i want some time to myself or to do chores as well. i know i'm just in a hard season and it'll get easier and sleeping just isn't going to be a perfect situation for awhile, but it's still important to me to try and not just resign myself to the nap gimmicks for him. she also craves a lot of mom time because i'm either working to get him to sleep in his crib, or he's in the carrier and she can't snuggle or climb all over me and gets frustrated. i try and spend as much time with her as i can especially when he's napping and my husband has been awesome with her on weekends and when he's home from work but we both often feel frustrated by the end of the day. any advice, tips and tricks etc. would be very appreciated!	polkadotteddonkey	/r/Mommit/comments/lpet5d/advice_for_adjusting_to_2_kids/	9	2	0	1.0	1613967265.0

omma looking for adult diaper recommendation. also where can i get a changing table in korea out what else can i use?	remove if not allowed but i thought someone here might know. my son suffered brain damage, is now reliant on diapers. he gets a heavy flow at night. he sits still in a good position with a pillow unless he is in my lap and reclined. we tried some brands at the store and they leak at least once a day sometimes many times a day i think it's because it's too thin for his entire bladder especially at night. i'm thinking of buying them online but i'm not sure what to do. if you use them i would like to know what you like.. he's 25 166cm and 65 kilograms trying to gain weight after being underweight for other reasons. comfort is the biggest concern for me, needs something soft. nothing slip on, only pin or tape. i have been changing him in his bed. but i don't like using a pad on his bed where he sleeps. dressing him in bed gets hard because his bed is lower than my waist. i'm also worried about him falling off of the bed because he slips in bed easily. i would like to find a special needs changing table that was safe and comfortable for him. good for me at my height because i'm very tall and maybe one that i can store things in instead of using space in the dresser. i'm not good at assembling so it will be something i have to deliver or pick up. i would also like a recommendation on what to do in public bathroom besides for using many mats. thank you for any recommendation.	myaccount00001	/r/Mommit/comments/lqfdj2/omma_looking_for_adult_diaper_recommendation_also/	7	7	0	0.89	1614076500.0

any tips for getting my toddler to eat more fruits/veg?	my 30 month old is so picky! it all started when we moved from purees and onto actual food when he was around 9 months old. around the time he turned 2 he started going off a lot of the very limited food that he did eat. this includes homemade meatballs pasta bake rice meals including paella and risotto fish and chips cheese he will now only eat toast plain rice only scrambled eggs crackers / rice and corn thins cheerios popcorn sweet baked items like banana bread and muffins but he will pick out any fruit or veg bits that he notices. he even picks out chocolate chips because he's that picky. he does drink smoothies but only if they taste really good. i tried putting capsicum in a strawberry and banana smoothie and he was horrified and refused to drink smoothies after that. i have to be so careful! does anyone have any tips or recipes for how to get fruits and veg into him? he will not eat any fruit or veg because he hates the texture. he used to eat freeze dried raspberries but he doesn't anymore. he does not have any meat in his diet at present because he refuses anything i offer. thanks for any help! this parenting thing is so hard.	martinettegreer	/r/Mommit/comments/lrr9qy/any_tips_for_getting_my_toddler_to_eat_more/	7	2	0	1.0	1614211987.0

i need advice	this is going to be long but i'm at a loss. tldr am i being paranoid still being careful to avoid situations that would increase my chance of getting covid? how do i stop resenting my husband for all the freedom he has? how do i balance my needs with my family/household responsibilities? 29 year old mom, 1 year old daughter. i became a mom for the first time right has covid locked everything down. so my ftm anxiety went into overdrive. i learned to balance safety with still seeing people but still struggle with fear over covid. and honestly with not looking like a hypocrite that says wear a mask! but then goes out to eat in a restaurant. through this all my husband has been able to maintain his hobbies because they are all mostly outdoors and his friends all work with him. i really struggle with the fact he seems like his life has gone on as normal after we had a child but ultimately i'm stuck at home watching the baby while he goes off and does stuff. he's constantly saying that he'll watch the baby while i go do stuff but there is almost nothing i can do for fun. my friends all live 2+ hours away and my family 3 hours away. we don't have a gym near by. it's winter so sometimes the weather isn't the greatest to be outside otherwise i'd go for a run. and if i do say hey i'm going to go take some photos he says wait we'll go with you and turns it into a family hike that i don't get the time i need for photos. i'm feeling a lot of resentment and we argue a lot. i've gone on antidepressants both for myself and in hopes it would reduce our arguments . we both work 10 hour days, 4 days a week but i have monday off and he has fridau off so the baby only needs to be in daycare 3 days a week. it feels like non-stop work for me because i take on the bulk of taking care of the baby. my husband also has a very relaxed job so there are days he doesn't have to really do anything while i'm stuck chained to my computer. he'll try to guilt me into going to do something because the baby is in daycare. i get he's trying but i literally have to record what i do in extreme detail for work. i hate having to fudge details. i'm literally home working right now and he's sitting at a bar drinking and so happy because he has missed it. i couldn't help myself but snap at him over text because i'm mad that he can just casually drink at a bar worry and responsibility free. on top of it all he tells me he gets irritated when the house isn't perfectly clean when he gets home on my day that i watch the baby all day. he seriously thinks that while watching a 1 year old i should be able to do all the chores around the house. i don't want to hate my husband. but it is all just sucking right now and i don't know how to fix it.	aaaaaandIshouldgo	/r/Mommit/comments/lsgvsd/i_need_advice/	13	2	0	1.0	1614287114.0

vomiting... when to be worried?	the last three mornings, about an hour after a bottle feed my 8 month old baby has been projectile vomiting. he is fine when he wakes up, and fine for about a half an hour but then all of a sudden gets super fussy and ends up vomiting. he also vomited twice at bedtime about a week ago, and vomited yesterday an hour after the feed in the afternoon. hasnt had any new kind of solids, i do a mix of pure and blw. yesterday the only solids he had were a pure of apple & blueberries and some rice cereal. today i tried sitting him up and i tried feeding him rice cereal about a half hour after the bottle. called dr yesterday and their guess was gas? he is extremely fussy before and after. basically an hour of bouncing on the ball is the only thing to keep him semi happy and eventually asleep. any advice??	cbonn3	/r/Mommit/comments/lwvt4w/vomiting_when_to_be_worried/	3	1	0	1.0	1614783536.0
the dairy dilemma, or how i ate two bowls of mac-n-cheese	ill start by saying ive been no-dairy since november. it makes my skin issues a little bit better and i feel a bit thinner without eating cheese and the rest of that whole delicious category of food. so, lo is potty-training right now after a few false starts. he is my highly sensitive child, so im trying to make sure everything else is easy-peesy for him. he also participates in the hobbit-style of eating, so he was ready for his third meal of the day at 2 pm or so. he requested mac-n-cheese. perfect i had one of the little microwaveable cups of annies on hand. i make it, add a little butter and milk to make it extra delicious, and he immediately takes issue with the noodles being long and thin, rather than shells. again, not wanting to cause any drama with the delicate potty training situation, i took the untouched mac back to the kitchen and started some acceptable noddles boiling. the only other important information to this story is that i hate wasting food. if he had eaten some of it and just gotten full, i wouldnt have care, but i hate that it was all fixed and then promptly discarded. that mac just sat in the counter while i was waiting for the other noodles to cook and i just felt so guilty. so i ate it. whatever; i am the captain of my fate, i am the master of my soul. i can eat the dairy once to soothe the feeling of guilt for being wasteful. whatever, indeed. so, the second batch is almost ready. i had to do it the long way, waiting for the cheese and butter to melt, adding milk, and more cheese because i added too much milk, more cheese, and so on and so forth. this time, im not sure why it was yucky, but it didnt get eaten. so, you can guess what happened next. so, thats how i ended up eating two bowls of mac-n-cheese.

can i have some advice for changing clothes and diapers for special needs teen that moves a lot?	my child is 15 so she's much older, suffering autism and lack of communication and some cognitive skills from limbic failure in her brain.. she moves around alot and she cannot help with dressing or changing. i am separate from my husband's now but he used to be able to distract her or help until can i begin fighting and he started screaming at her which i'm sure made things worse. since separating now it's just myself. i'm a little bigger than her and i can lift her. she moves her hips or legs a lot and she's very skinny but a lot faster than me since i'm old and i only have two hands. sometimes she does cooperate and will give me her arm or leg or if i put her arms and legs up she will keep them up, but only a minute later and she will be moving around. i believe it's out of habit but sometimes she laughs. have considered bribing or distancing but i'm not sure if that will only make this worse. i have a changing table with a belt but i don't want to restrain her unless i need to as belts and rails are just to keep her from falling off a bed or table. is there a certain way i can do things faster, or more comfortable for her or s way to position her? i use disposable diapers with tabs for the sides which i find are much easier than cloth but she also needs pads at night and prescription cream for pressure stores and rash but she really does not like it. can i have some help with clothing? she wears a lot of joggers and sweatpants or hoodies because they're the easiest for me to put on and she chews on buttons and velcro so that is not an option, she can undo velcro and zippers and they irritate skin. i have fried dressing her with me and front and tried dressing her from behind which worked for a while and is no longer.	ujeongbabo	/r/Mommit/comments/m4b4h8/can_i_have_some_advice_for_changing_clothes_and/	7	24	0	0.95	1615657170.0

how did you know you were done having kids?	my husband and i have 4 kids. we had rpl and used ivf to conceive last 2. my husband had a vasectomy afterwards to make sure we didnt have another loss. i have 2 embryos on ice. we are both in our early 30s and executive roles. while we work a lot we have wonderful nanny and spend lots of time with the kids. money isnt a factor in our decision. we always planned on 4. everyone i talk to says youll know when youre done. but i dont feel sure. i often think about what a fifth would be like for our family. did you know when you were done? if so did you know for practical reasons or more emotional?

5.5 month old daughter screams after bath. please help!	every night after a bath, when i first lay her down and start toweling her dry she starts screaming. she's fine before, during and right after when i take her out and she's still wet she's happy as can be. but, as soon as i start to pat her dry, she turns into a banshee all the way up until we're snuggled up and can nurse for a few minutes. i use unscented aquaphor baby wash or aveeno oatmeal baby wash if she's really dry. some nights i don't even use soap, just rinse her and let her splash for a bit. i don't use scented lotions, or oils. i don't understand why this is happening now. she just started doing this about three weeks ago and it's not every night either. i don't know if she's itchy, if it's just the witching hours coinciding with bath time, or if she's pissed because it finally registers that bed time is a approaching when i dry her off. has anyone dealt with something similar? should i stop doing bath time every night? it's really stressful trying to trudge through the rest of our bedtime routine with her screaming and it's starting to give me anxiety and dread just thinking about 6 30pm.

anyone want to share their dinner time experiences?	hi. i am a mom of three and i have been struggling with meal planning a bit. now that my youngest is getting into sitting at the table with us i want to make an effort to have family meals that are well prepared and nourishing. not just because it is healthy but i also want my kids to grow up valuing dinner time and not eating their food in front of the tv. i have been using this app which has helped me with ordering groceries and planning out healthy meals. there is a pretty large variety of dishes on the app which i love. i am curious though.. what do you guys do? do you even meal plan or do you just wing it? let me know as i would love to experiment and find a stable pattern.	sweetpotatosoulfood	/r/Mommit/comments/m5k8ho/anyone_want_to_share_their_dinner_time_experiences/	13	1	0	0.67	1615813485.0

parents with older children who bed-shared with them or wore them using carriers how do they sleep now? did they have any issues sleeping on their own? when did they start sleeping by themselves in their own beds?	i'm currently bed sharing with my 7 week old and i wear him in a carrier for naps. this is something everyone in my family has done as culturally where we're from, this is the norm. my husband's family is from canada and strongly believe in sleep training and baby sleeping in crib. both sides believe strongly that harm comes to baby if i do one or the other. i've been trying to put him in his crib for sleep. this results in hours of crying where he gets overtired and then it takes hours to put him to bed at night. looking for advice and reassurance from either camp. i'm exhausted, anxious i'm doing the wrong thing. i feel like so long as he's sleeping and gaining weight, it can't be wrong. but i'm scared that by not putting him to sleep in his own bed, i'm doing something wrong.	libertinq	/r/Mommit/comments/m6acgi/parents_with_older_children_who_bedshared_with/	10	6	0	1.0	1615905025.0
what size to buy?	a friend is due to have a baby in april. i am planning to put together a gift basket which will include some clothing purchased out of the country . i was intending to just do basic onesies to maximize their ability to use in different seasons. we live someplace with hot summers and super cold winters. they own a farm, so are outdoors a lot. they also won't be finding out the sex of the baby until it is born. i'm struggling with sizing. my own kid was a giant - he was in 6-9 month clothing before he was 3 months old, and in 2t clothes before 10 months, which meant that everything i'd been given was seasonally inappropriate, but i don't know if my kid was a huge outlier or the norm?	greenpotatoes9	/r/Mommit/comments/m6c3kq/what_size_to_buy/	7	2	0	1.0	1615909784.0

how much stuff does baby actually need?	hello all! i was wondering if any experienced parents could help me plan what we're actually going to need for our wee one. i'm 27+3 and a ftm. i have literally held a baby about 3 times in my life and neither me nor my partner know a single other person with a little one to ask . we're making this up as we go along ha, but it seems to be working out so far. we're also on a semi tight budget so i don't want to over buy on things that we just won't get use out of. baby boy is measuring on the bigger side in the 90th percentile - my partner is 6' 5 and was a super long 10 pound baby so that's no surprise - and i don't know if we should even be getting many newborn items or go straight to 0-3 months. will he grow out of newborn super quickly? he's also going to be a winter baby where the temperature will go below 10c often, so we need to factor that in. so far we've got the basics - cot with flannelette sheets - 1 waterproof mattress cover - change table/bath - a few onsies in each size, 0000/000/00 - newborn singlets - a woollen jumper size 000 - socks - beanies/hats - 2 pairs of fleece pants size 000 - 5 bibs - wash cloths - 3 muslin and 2 velcro wrap swaddles - front carry pack - bath items - soap/moisturiser/oil etc - lots of nappies in size 1 and plenty of wipes still to buy - stoller - breast pump and storage - carseats - towels - monitor - pacifiers any advice on things you really valued, found useful or would recommend getting more of would be incredible. i can't believe how quickly this pregnancy is going, before i know it ppi is going to be here and i feel very, very under prepared haha sincerely, a confused and utterly stumped new mama.	ebebewini	/r/Mommit/comments/mfgmhk/how_much_stuff_does_baby_actually_need/	42	8	0	0.91	1616988052.0
advice weening a 2 yr old off the bottle	hey moms, ive asked family members and her doctor about how to ween toddlers off the bottle and they usually just say throw it way. my daughter wakes up crying for it even when she eats all her dinner before bed. she still sleeps with us and and her dad wants her to have it bc he doesnt want her to be hungry. shes starting to throw up her milk here and there bc shes constantly drinking it. she had 3 8 oz bottles the other night and im starting to get concerned because she practically screams for it. she eats all 3 meals a day and her snacks plus her bottles and lots of water throughout the day. its time to get her blood test soon so we will see if her diet during the day is poor that may be causing her to be hungry at night. shes a very healthy toddler. im just at a loss as to how to week this big ol mamas off her bottle. any tips? edit she also refuses to drink milk out of anything other than her bottle	milk_weed7	/r/Mommit/comments/mfib0v/advice_weening_a_2_yr_old_off_the_bottle/	3	1	0	1.0	1616994830.0
 why am i being punished?	i just need to get this out there because i'm awake at 5 30 in the morning on my vacation with period cramps. i haven't gotten a vacation since our honeymoon in 2019. we finally decided to take a vacation to visit my husband's sister in florida who has only seen our child once since she was born in 2020. we also decided to drive for covid safety reasons. 19 hours if there were no stops. with a one year old. what could go wrong right? first night we stopped at my parents to drop our dogs off and spent the night there. baby was up puking all night from what i assume was the flu and daycare confirmed other kids had been sent home. luckily she was 100% the next morning and that night at her bedtime we set off. it was mostly good all night and she was a little fussy during her wake up time but we made it to tallahassee just fine. spent the day there and planned to spend the night before going on to englewood. my turn to be up all night puking. the puking stopped just in time for us to make the last 5 hour leg of our drive which the baby fussed the entire way through. we tried stopping at a park but she cried when we set her down even though she loves outside. she refused to eat all day. she refused to drink. we finally made it though and baby was happy to walk around the rental house and finally ate some dinner. then since i was still feeling off i took my temperature and i had a fever of 101. ended up laying down the rest of the day with my husband changing out cold wash cloths on my head and got my fever down. so day 4 of our trip i finally felt somewhat normal, if still lacking a little bit of an appetite. it's morning 5 and i feel a little weird. go pee and bam, hello period 3 days early. so here i am, lying in pain once more on the couch in the rental, while my baby sleeps soundly and my husband snores in the bedroom. i just wanted a nice vacation from my stressful job. and yes it's still nice not to work and to be in warmer weather. but man, i would have liked it to be just that much better by not being a zombie. .

how did you tell your child their father was actually their stepfather?	for some quick background on where i'm going to... i have a 6 year old daughter, who's biological father is completely out of the picture. he abandoned her when she was about 3 years old. never heard from him since. . when she turned 3 i got married and moved states. before doing so, i went to court to get permission. he agreed... and that was the end of him. he never called/txt. never paid the agreed child support. never requested visitations. changed his cell , moved address, blocked me out of all social media. i have no idea if he is even alive. at the beginning my daughter sometimes questioned his absence... but she quickly stopped talking about him all toguether. she is now 6 and doesn't remember him at all. she absolutely thinks that her stepdad is her real dad, and loves him so much. my husband and i are starting the process of him adopting her legally... but i don't want her in the future to think that i hid the truth from her. did you pass thorough the same/similar process, and how did you deliver the truth to your lo. how old was him/her? how did they react? did something change?

couch suggestions?	uhhh. not sure if this is the appropriate place to ask this, but i'm getting desperate. we are in need of a new couch. we are looking for a sectional. we have one toddler and three animals and our current couch situation is terrible. my husband and i fell in love with an ikea sectional, but it's been out of stock for months. we've both been put on the list to be notified for if and when it comes back in stock, we check daily, and we've even been told on numerous occasions that it's coming in this week. we like the ikea sectional because one of our main issues is that we have a dog that likes to dig on the furniture and he's completely destroyed our couch covers. i know that the ikea cushion covers can be removed to be washed and you can buy them separately so that way if our dog does decide to destroy them we can always purchase new ones to replace them. does anyone have any affordable suggestions for a sectional that fits some of this criteria? should we just suck it up and wait in hopes that someday the ikea section will come back in stock? i just want to be able to enjoy sitting on my couch again.	optimuspaige91	/r/Mommit/comments/mghcjq/couch_suggestions/	28	6	0	1.0	1617114647.0

new mom seeking professional advice	i hope this is ok to post here. i accepted a job offer for a work from home job, which is not typical for my field, so i dont have a lot of people i can ask for advice, leading me to seek advice from you lovely moms of reddit. i have a two month old baby and am so grateful for this job because i was truly dreading going back to work full time away from home while he is so young. i did not realize how traumatized i would be at the thought of putting him in daycare . my question is this - is it frowned upon to admit that i will be providing childcare myself while working on the 2-3 days per week that my husband also works? i know that when hes older and more active, we will need other childcare plans. for now, i am confident that i can work and also care for him. my dilemma comes from the on-site training portion of the job. they have been very vague about how long it will be, what hours/days per week i will have to be on-site. i have asked twice, but have not gotten a clear answer. i feel that my only option for getting a clear answer is to tell them i need to coordinate around my husbands work schedule so that one of us is always home - i was lead to believe that the training would be a couple of weeks and some reading/education module materials could be done at home. then one of my new coworkers said i would be on-site 3-6 months 5 days per week. this would not work for our situation so i need to know. i hope this makes sense. thank you!	mangosrphat	/r/Mommit/comments/mhxfmo/new_mom_seeking_professional_advice/	9	3	0	1.0	1617290034.0

how much of your home is dedicated to your kids/toys?	we live in a fairly small condo with 3 small rooms. one is a study/workout room, the other is the master and the third room is shared by my two boys . then theres this random open space by our dining area that weve made into a play area . we went condo hunting today because we are looking to move sometime soon. we looked at few places and i was surprised by this one home that we saw because literally 80% of the place was dedicated to the baby! the whole family room was covered in playmats, no tv or sofa, ball pool, shelves, sooo many toys, etc. then they had another room dedicated as another playroom with more toys and books. im a minimalist when it comes to toys, so seeing all the bins of toys was overwhelming. then it made me think... am i wrong for not giving my boys a home with more toys and making it more kid oriented?? is it bad that i still want to keep my home decor looking somewhat nice?! it just made me curious how everyone elses home is.

why does my mom hate that i workout?	i have decided to post this here because i would like the opinions of other moms on this situation. i am 16 years old and i have struggled with bulimia since i was 12 years old, recently i have been going to the gym 6 days a week and i finally have a normal eating schedule while also being happy with my body . i am a 65 male and used to only weigh 145 pounds and now i am up to 200 which consists of mostly muscle, that being said, my mother has been extremely critical of all my working out and often complains that i eat too much protein she would rather me stay at home and no nothing instead of going to the gym and i simply just cannot wrap my brain around it, i dont know why she wont just let me be happy and finally do something i love which has cured an illness that i have had for almost 5 years now, keep in mind, my mother is not in shape and rarely exercises. she often gets mad at me when i do not want to eat unhealthy things and tells me that i am too uptight, i dont even know why i am writing this but maybe some of you guys can shed some light on what you think is happening because this is taking a big toll on my mental health.	bigluinthehouse	/r/Mommit/comments/ml3ndu/why_does_my_mom_hate_that_i_workout/	5	2	0	0.75	1617683797.0
does anyone else get asked inappropriate questions because of your age?	im 28. i had my daughter when i was 23. i have a case of baby face. now we also have a 1 year old and i am 8 months pregnant with our surprise 3rd. i am not that young comparatively but in my area it seems like im always the youngest one for my oldest in group settings. like her school and extras. for some reason that seems like its an open door for other parents to ask me questions i dont think they would ask other moms. i have been asked if my kids all have the same dad. and if i am married . ive even been asked since my daughter is blonde like her dad and i have black hair if shes from my husbands first marriage. ill also get questions like do you know where those come from?! referring to my pregnancy. or youre sooooo young. why did you want to do this all so young? i just always get so awkward because these are usually people i have to see again. i always try to reply that im older then i look but honestly i dont feel like its okay to ask these questions even i was exceptionally young. im sure by my youngest ill be more the average age for parents but for right now its super uncomfortable and im wondering if anyone here deals with this or what they would respond with.

talk to me when you have 5.	update thanks you all for your advice and encouragement. you are my people! i hate talking to my mom about motherhood. i have 2 kids and she had 5 kids in 9 years. whenever i complain about anything she says talk to me when you have 5, and it bugs me. she was a sahm, we lived on a farm and were outside all day, my dad was a cpa and made plenty of money. i am a marine on active duty and my husband has his own business. it is not the same. she keeps asking when i am having more and i say nothing like a pandemic to make you not want anymore kids. of course her response, talk to me when you have 5. just had to vent. i always hoped i could talk to my mom about raising kids but she makes me feel like she feels she was a better mother because i am exhausted and stressed. i feel bad enough when i have to work and give up time with my boys but i provide for this family and i do not plan on giving up my career.	_space_lord_mother	/r/Mommit/comments/mlqcaz/talk_to_me_when_you_have_5/	192	594	0	0.99	1617756565.0

struggling with a newborn who always wants to eat	hi all! apologies in advance for the long post, but my husband and i are getting desperate. our baby is 7 weeks old, and we are struggling with feeding and sleeping. he will spend hours on the breast, screaming if we take him off of it, lazily eating. we'll often take him off to give him a bottle if he seems frustrated or my nipples start to hurt too much, and he'll do the same lazy feeding thing on the bottle. feeding sessions regularly last between 2 to 6 hours, where he alternates between screaming at us, slowly eating, and seeming satisfied for 15-30 minutes before starting to scream again. we'll try other things during these feedings, like changing his diaper, entertaining him, using a pacifier, bouncing him, changing his outfit, etc, but nothing seems to give him any relief other than a boob or bottle. he often doesn't sleep much during the day, since he constantly needs to be fed and fusses when not on the breast or bottle. during the night he'll sleep for a 3 or 4 hour stretch but then be up every other hour needing to be fed. we've seen a couple of lactation consultants and gotten a tongue and lip tie release, but still no change. has anyone else had experience with something like this?	sistercarrie422	/r/Mommit/comments/mqwj8u/struggling_with_a_newborn_who_always_wants_to_eat/	11	3	0	1.0	1618424280.0

struggling as a working mother	thanks to the pandemic, i was able to be with my son all day every day. i grew so attached to him but sadly i wasnt completely satisfied with being a stay at home mom. i needed more to life than that because my medication still wasnt quite straightened out. so i got a job. i told them i wanted work as much as possible without it becoming full time. got on some new meds and realized that was a mistake. i miss my baby man. i cry everyday because all i want is for him to be attached to me like he used to. at first it was literally unbearable. i was so miserable anytime i went into work. asked for my hours decreased which they agreed to but because we weve been short staffed that wasnt exactly a possibility these last few weeks. so ive been working basically everyday and ive noticed that im starting to miss him less and less. i still miss him tons obviously, but its not like my only focus anymore. im starting to care about myself and my needs. maybe its just the medication fully kicking in but either way, i feel guilty as hell. when i get home and see him i feel like the worst mother in the world because im becoming my own person and hes not the only aspect of my life anymore. i can see how attached to my mother hes become and it hurts my feelings so bad. i miss being the one he clung to. i want it back. i miss nursing him. i miss the cuddles and the play time. i miss everything and i wish i hadnt taken it for granted. now that hes transitioning from baby to toddler hes growing out of all those things and becoming more independent. just like me i suppose. so when i am home with him all he wants to play and run around and im just so exhausted form work that all i can do is sit around and talk to him while watching some of his favorite shows. which kills me. its sheer toucher not having the energy to play with him all the time like he wants. when i do i love it more than anything but some days it feels impossible. i just need some pointers on how to cope with this. the mom guilt from both working and rediscovering myself as an individual. i hope im not alone in this.	yetanotherblonde	/r/Mommit/comments/mr5brv/struggling_as_a_working_mother/	14	5	0	0.85	1618452275.0

the potty. help me.	my daughter just turned 2. like on saturday. she had her check up on monday and doc told me to start potty training and see how it goes. she doesn't have all the signs of being ready to actually potty train but i thought i would bring out her potties so she can get used to it. i also ordered a potty book. i also grabbed one of her favorite stuffed animals and put on a cloth diaper on it. that way we could talk about poop pee and what not. my thinking was that i would let her and bert sit on the potty together a few times a day. then when her book gets here we could maybe take the diaper off and sit her on it with no expectation of her actually using it. you know, just so she could get used to the idea. one of the potties is a mini toilet and she loves that thing. so i figured that i would take her diaper off and tell her that we do that when we want to pee and poop. 15min in she sits and stand and turns around and is all very happy. then i put the diaper on and cue meltdown. she wants to sit on the potty but only if she is butt naked. should i continue on like this? is this good? i honestly don't know how to go from here. she doesn't tell me that she wants to be changed or that she has soiled herself. i know she is pooping because she hides in a corner and makes faces and her poops are constant because of that. she also grabs at her diaper only when it's dirty. we change her 3 times a day only. but she still doesn't have the communication skills to tell me she is going/ has gone. i don't expect her to get it right away and i don't want to push it. i've read a lot about this and the whole introduction to the potty always seems very vague. i don't want to do one of those 3day potty training things because those can be traumatic. help me? advice? anecdotes? how did yall go about introducing it?	abbylightwood	/r/Mommit/comments/mrolew/the_potty_help_me/	4	1	0	0.67	1618522153.0

what is spoiling, actually?	i dont know where else to ask for advice but i always find reddit to be the least judgey and the most kind. i have a 3 month old daughter. while shes still tiny im working hard to learn how to be a good and positive parent and i learn how i grew up. my parents had very strong views about things. and im trying to find out whats truth and whats not. 1 my parents never ever bought us nice presents or a special outfit that cost good money. their attitude was that is spoiling, and even told us that kids that had nice xmas gifts or a fancy outfit or something were spoiled. we were not poor. my dad made 6 figures. at xmas all of our gifts were $20 or less. i grew up thinking this was normal and believed that kids really were spoiled. but now that i have a daughter, i cant wait for birthdays and christmas. i want to be able to buy her that one, expensive, special gift she desperately wants. but i still cant shake how i was brought up. its normal to want to buy your kids nice things, right? i mean, no you cant give in to all their demands, but is there anything wrong with buying her a power wheels or an american girl doll or something? im so brainwashed from my youth still that i honestly dont know. i also was never allowed to go to prom because my family was in a cult like church that forbade dancing. but my senior year i was chosen for homecoming. my mom refused to waste money on a dressmind you i just wanted a $50 one i saw at a consignment shop. i ended up sewing one myself that looked like crap and i was laughed at. it was humiliating. that was in 1999 and i still remember how i felt that day. im looking online at christening gowns for my daughters baptism and the one i want is $100. is that spoiling? she only gets one baptism and we want to pay a photographer at our church to take pictures in her gown. i know this all sounds so silly but im trying to relearn how i was brought up. 2 my parents also never signed us up for things like dance or scouts or anything that cost money. same attitude. its not spoiling to invest in your kids, right? i know this all sounds silly. but i want to be a good mom. i dont want my daughter growing up wondering why am i not worth investing in?.	skateoclock	/r/Mommit/comments/msr0t3/what_is_spoiling_actually/	15	27	0	0.97	1618667119.0

advice needed on breastfeeding/bottles and stubborn babies with thrush	help please! this is a long post but i need some insight bad. do any of you have experience with babies that are still kinda cluster feeding at 3-4 months old? how can i curb it in order to get her on a 2-3 hour schedule? also, bottle advice!? background she was born on new years day, as of now we are still ebf and bed sharing. she wont take a bottle. at all. not with breast milk, not with formula, she will not drink them in a box, she will not drink them with a fox. weve tried five different kinds of bottles and she has yet to take more than a half ounce or so. she wants to nurse constantly. like every half hour , before and after every activity, to go to sleep and immediately upon waking up. but every time i latch her on, she nurses actively for maybe 10 minutes before she falls asleep, and if i wake her, the process starts all over again. i spend about 80% of my days on the couch with my tit in her mouth, and it seems like she is never full/satisfied. i cant put her down to do things and she wont hang out with her dad for more than 10 minutes without getting upset, looking for me and rooting. i was supposed to go back to work in february but now im looking at the middle-end of may. so i need to put her in daycare before the end of may and i want that transition to not be horrible for her and her teachers. because i know as both a parent and former daycare teacher how much it sucks when you have to leave a baby for 6-8 hours, knowing they arent ready to be separated. i cant do that to her, myself or her teachers. we also have thrush. shes had it consistently since the beginning of february and it comes and goes in my breasts. i just bought some gentian violet and have been giving it to her every day. ive had numerous people tell me that the thrush may be keeping her from taking the bottle as well. ideally i would like to get her on bottles during the day and then once im home from work she can nurse as much as she wants, plus all through the night since we bedshare. i know this is a lot of info, but i really want you guys to know what im working with over here so you can share any and all experiences/advice you may have. thanks in advance!!!	klaumc	/r/Mommit/comments/mu7nd6/advice_needed_on_breastfeedingbottles_and/	3	1	0	1.0	1618858418.0
weaning off bottle advice	my daughter just turned 1 year old. she currently eats 3 meals a day and has 1 or 2 snacks. she also drinks 5 formula bottles a day totaling about 30 ounces. at her doctor appointment today, her doctor said we can start taking out the formula and replacing with about 12-15 ounces of whole milk max. she also recommended we wean completely from the bottle by the time shes 15 months old. moms - please give me any tips you have for transitioning from warmed formula to cold milk and for weaning off of the bottle. im most worried about the bottle she gets right before bedtime because i think thats mainly for comfort.

13 year old boy wetting his bed, need some advice!	hi all, i'm new here and hoping for some advice. my 13 year old son has been wetting his bed recently he hasn't had any issues since he was younger and was out of diapers at night by his 7th birthday. but over the past couple of months or so he has started to wet his bed again, at first just occasionally but now more regularly, he's had accidents the last 4 nights and only had 1 dry night in the last week. my friend's daughter is a bedwetter and she is in diapers at night, although she's only 9, so a bit younger. dawn says that really helps and recommended putting james back in diapers at night. i don't know how to go about it really, or even where to get any diapers that would fit a small 13 year old boy! or if theres any help or other advice that would really would be appreciated. we've tried the usual, restricting fluids, waking him up, seeing his doctor and getting a second opinion etc. hes somewhat immature for his age but we didn't have this problem before so dont think its related thanks in advance!

after struggling with postpartum, finally found a bright side!	hi everyone! i've been dealing with postpartum depression after having my daughter . after a traumatic birth, the depression and a few other factors, i really struggled with finding happiness. i've recently started going to counseling and it helps tremendously, i can't recommend it enough! the past few days, i feel happier than i've been since giving birth! my daughter has refused to eat any solid foods for the past month, but i've been slowly working with her every day and she finally ate a few spoonfuls of pureed corn/green beans! i was so happy i almost cried. it gets so overwhelming having a kid that sometimes i forget to enjoy the little things. i know it's something little, but her eating finally makes me feel like we're finally doing something right! edit thank you so much for all of your advice and helpful tips! you're all wonderful momma's 	MelodicSecret7296	/r/Mommit/comments/mve7y0/after_struggling_with_postpartum_finally_found_a/	36	318	0	0.99	1619006740.0
need advice re fmla / std	husband and i are 32 weeks along tomorrow. lo is due june 17. both of us are working currently but are intending of course to take time off for babys arrival. he gets four weeks paid of parental leave to take that can be used however he likes as long as its taken before babys 1st birthday. i can use short term disability, fmla , and pto if i wish . 12 weeks from july 13 is the first week of october. so assuming baby comes around actual due date that could be 16 weeks of time off and std only covers 5 weeks and obviously its not full coverage. additional factors to know we live in an apartment and our lease needs to be renewed and as expected rent is going up. the cheapest option is signing for a 15 month lease that would be $66 dollars more than our current amount. another option is buying a house . our insurance is through my husbands employer so his check brings in less than mine does. adding a child to the plan will only worsen this of course. we would be putting our child into daycare once i return to work. i am curious to hear how others managed going down an income for a few months when youre bringing a baby into the world.

how did you treat a diaper rash ?	hi mommies! im very curious whats prescribed and advised in your country on how to treat serious diaper rash. my 1-month old has it near his butthole and scrotum. our pediatrician prescribed gentian violet antiseptic to apply twice a day and later in a few days when it gets better start applying some water based soothing paste . also airing out the wound twice a day at least. the reason why im asking is im not seeing any improvement with the gentian solution and i hate seeing my baby suffering ; any suggestions on an effective ointment or anything that works?

4 month sleep regression - advice needed	hello, i'm currently up with our baby girl - she'll be 4 months old in 6 days and we're pretty confident she's started her 4 month sleep regression. she's gone from sleeping a solid 8-11 hours of a night to waking every 1-3 hours. i'm sorry if this is a bit jumbled, i'm really tired . after she's eaten again, she'll settle and we can get her to sleep. she's just been eating so much because of this. she was averaging 850-900ml a day, now it's 1,100-1,200. she's 6.3kg and a doctor told us babies can have 130-180ml per-kilo, which is a max of 1,134ml so she's on the higher end of normal but she's also had diarrhoea since yipping it this much so i'm sure it's too much for her. but if she's begging for food, can we refuse it and hope she falls back asleep eventually? food isn't currently a sleep association - we can get her to sleep without food other times any advice would be great, thank you!

i love, love, loooove the little one, but i have to vent about how my lovely 12-month old really gets under my skin when i have things to do and can't because she doesn't want to go to sleep. it's really frustrating.	do you know what i mean? in my case... i promised two clients i'd work on and email them something and i haven't been able to get to it since earlier. so i figure okay i'll do it when the baby is asleep. well, she went down for a brief moment earlier and now at 11 50p i'm still trying to get her to go back to sleep. ...and one of my eyes is dry. so blinking is becoming tiresome and annoying. ...and i have to pick up all the items that she earlier pulled out of drawers, etc. that i've already cleaned up once before today. ...and i'm sleepy. ...and there are crumbs that i need to vacuum from her cheerios mess but i can't do so until tomorrow . ...and i always fear bugs any time food isn't dealt with. we don't have a bug problem, but it's still a source of anxiety for me. ...and then while i'm trying to type all this on my phone while nursing her, hopefully so that she can go back to sleep, she keeps reaching up and messing me up by touching the phone. ...and i'm tired. ...and she keeps popping up or squirming. it's just that perfect mix of frustration all at the same time. can anyone relate? i hate when this happens.	ughatsocialmedia	/r/Mommit/comments/mwmscl/i_love_love_loooove_the_little_one_but_i_have_to/	5	7	0	0.9	1619150278.0

 i think my water broke in my sleep but still no contractions.	hey moms. i am a second time mom planning on a home birth. i think my water broke in my sleep a few hours ago, and the interwebs tells me to stimulate nipples to start contractions. this is rare in like 8 percent of women if i didn't just pee myself. any other moms have this happen to them? my midwife is an hour and a half drive away so i don't want to bother her until i am actually having contractions. update thank you for your replies! i went pee twice in the past few hours and it looks like my mucus plug has come out. a little blood with it and then some more water after i peed. so i am sure my water broke now and am using the manual pump for the breast and am waiting for contractions to start in the next 24 hours. it seems if they don't start on their own, i will need induction. fingers crossed that i start on my own.	andthecrowdgoeswild	/r/Mommit/comments/mwvxwh/advice_i_think_my_water_broke_in_my_sleep_but/	10	1	0	0.57	1619186505.0
anyone else deal with a baby who is mostly whiny with mom?? touched tf out.	my 10 month old has been a clinger since about 4-5 months old. she is literally and figuratively attached to me at all times. if i put her down, she screams. i can sometimes put her down to play on the floor, but only if i also sit on the floor. if i get up, even in her eye sight, to even just grab water... screaming. if i hand her to my husband or grandma, screaming. she only stops if i leave the room. and then, if she sees or even hears me talking, she starts screaming. she usually will play with them for 15-30 minutes and then will start getting fussy and try to find me, either for comfort or food. she doesn't really like to be worn, and even if she did, i can't wear her all day. the only saving grace is that she sleeps well. i am going to go insane. i stay home with her and her older brother , and my first was not this clingy . please tell me this ends. i'm so touched out.	cmtoppin	/r/Mommit/comments/mx6eus/anyone_else_deal_with_a_baby_who_is_mostly_whiny/	2	3	0	0.81	1619215928.0
struggling with decision to formula feed vs breastfeed	second time mom here, so you'd think i'd have figured this out more. some quick backstory... i had a breast reduction at age 15 because my boobs were so large they were hurting my back . i also hated how big they were and felt super self-conscious of them all the time, so the reduction was a godsend at the time. they warned me i might not be able to breastfeed when i had kids, but i was fine with that trade off and i still am. i tried breastfeeding my first and produced colostrum, but no supply ever came in and i gave up after awhile. no big deal. he never really got the hang of it anyway, there were other issues, etc. i just had my second baby on tuesday. i assumed i would have the same lack of success with breastfeeding, but decided it couldn't hurt to try. she latched a little better but didn't seem to be getting enough and i felt terrible seeing her hungry. plus my hubby loves bottle feeding and the bonding it lets him have, so it seemed like an easy decision. which brings us to now. my boobs are super sore, more than last time, which makes me wonder if my supply is coming in and this time around i might be able to breastfeed, at least partially. that should be good news, right? well, it's not. apparently, when confronted with the possibility of breastfeeding being an option, my response is anxiety and dread. so for the last day or two, i've had this constant internal argument going between the part of me that says i should breastfeed if i can and the side that recoils at all things breastfeeding, at least where it involves me. i don't want to be the only one to feed her, i don't want to pump and store milk, and i have a visceral negative reaction to the idea of my boobs being such a focus of my time and attention. for what it's worth, i don't even like them being touched during sex with my husband. at best, it does nothing for me. at worst, it completely kills any libido i had before that point and makes me actively want to stop physical intimacy. i don't know whether i'm looking for sympathy or advice or what, but i need something. i'm a hot mess of mom guilt, second guessing, sleep deprivation, sore boobs, and hormones. help.

my intense fear reaction when my daughter gets a scrape.	i feel am embarrassed and helpless at the moment. i gave birth to a baby girl who was born 2 months early. i add this point that she was a preemie as it probably has a lot to do with whats going. yesterday, my daughter was being a curious, but clumsy toddler. she tried to climb, but stumbled and ended up scraping and bruising her cheeks. her cheek immediately bruised, became swollen and, although it did not break the skin, there was a bit of blood evident right under the surface of the scrape. she cried and so did i...here lies the issue. as soon as my brain registered her injury, i burst out into a sobbing panic, for some reason i instinctively covered my ears and closed my eyes. my knees buckled and i uncontrollably sobbed. thankfully my wife was there to help our daughter. she took her into the bathroom to calmly attend to the injury and soothe our daughter. inevitably, our daughter stopped crying long before i did. i want to mention that i am in therapy. this wasnt the first time i had this reaction. after i had a similar reaction when she was first home from the nicu, i put myself in therapy. while therapy is immensely helpful in my life, this seems like an issue that i am stuck on. i should also mention that this is the only area of my life i have this type of paralyzing reaction. i am a very high functioning person in most aspects of my life, but this paralysis i experience is not only emotionally crushing it is dangerous!!! i have been fortunate to have had my wifes support in these moments, but of course, my fear is what will i do if she is not there. has anyone else experienced this? i suspect this is trauma related from being a nicu mom , but i dont understand the intensity. why do i instinctively cover my eyes and ears? why do i buckle to the floor?? any insight would be appreciated. thank you.	angel83014	/r/Mommit/comments/mxmr0g/my_intense_fear_reaction_when_my_daughter_gets_a/	5	3	0	1.0	1619279844.0

how do you make mom friends in a covid world?	my nearly 3 year old daughter told me the other day at the playground that she doesn't want to make friends, that she will just play by herself, and my heart broke. we've been quite careful because of covid and my high risk pregnancy, but covid cases are going down in my area and the baby is now 8 months old. i'd like to be social with other families again. problem is that we're new to our area and we didn't have a chance to really interact with many families before covid and now it feels like everyone is already covid-bubbled off, no room for us. i'm having intense middle school ptsd-flash backs from other moms saying well we play with our bubble then. i'm also a very introverted person by nature, with a dash of social anxiety, friendships don't come easy to me. but my daughter is such a great and fun kid. i know that she would love to socialize with someone besides me or her grandparents. we go to the park often hoping to run into another family and we're in park district classes but nothing meaningful is happening with other families. it would be super wonderful and great if i could meet a family even once a week, it takes my daughter a little while to warm up to people and situations, but if she knows them and sees them enough she's so much fun. i feel like i'm failing her and that she won't know how to socialize or make friends come preschool and it will be a lonely experience for her. anyone have any advice on how to get invited into a covid bubble? how assertive is too assertive? i kind of know this one mom, she has a daughter my kid's age but the problem is that she has an older kid who's in a bubble and a new baby younger than mine, so a lot going on. i also work but i can and will make it work around her schedule. i just need a set time and day each week to request time off. do i sound too desperate if i text her and ask if there's a specific time each week that our kids can hang out?	stephm524	/r/Mommit/comments/mz8d2a/how_do_you_make_mom_friends_in_a_covid_world/	9	5	0	0.86	1619472067.0

need parental advice when it comes to pre-teens and teens	i am a single 32 year old mother. 7 years ago i became my nieces and nephews foster parent and about a year later i adopted them. i never thought it twice just because all i wanted was to keep them together but as the years go by i feel like things are piling on top of me and i dont know where to go first. right now i have a 19, 17, 15, 13, 10, 9 and 8 year old. i have never had any kids of my own so with these different ranges in ages i am new to experiencing a lot in the parenting world. i never saw myself having kids so i never actually sat down and thought about what it would be like. i try and follow how my parents raised me and what i believe is right and wrong but why do i feel like im not good enough? or my kids dont value me? i sometimes hear them say im too strict and im afraid they will despise me. i feel like im just blabbing on and on. if someone understands where im at i would really appreciate some guidance or maybe reassurance that what im doing and where im headed is the right place.

how can they tell me not to stress out?	i'm currently pregnant and at my last ob/gyn appointment 3 weeks ago, they found that my baby's humerus and femur are short. i was sent to an additional ultrasound yesterday at the hospital for a more in-depth look. they found the same and said he's barely in the 10th percentile. the doctor came in and told me the potential reasons, the most likely being down syndrome but other potential syndromes or issues being the cause. i kept being told not to worry, that there's also potential that my baby could be born perfectly normal but maybe just be short. they had me do some blood work that would be a more in-depth analysis to better rule out trisomy 18 and trisomy 21 and i have to wait 7-10 days for the results. i could need to do a more invasive test, i will most likely need more monitoring on baby's growth. they kept telling me not to get nervous, not to worry, that everything could be totally fine and they just want to be precautions... but all i want to do is cry. it took everything i had in me not to have an anxiety attack. it was so overwhelming. even my boyfriend seemed to blow it all off and tell me not to stress out. how can i not stress out? i know stress is bad for me and bad for baby, but how can i not? i hardly slept last night, i woke up with a migraine... the more i'm left to think about it, the worse i feel. there could be something wrong with my baby and i'm being told not to stress or be nervous??? waiting on the results is going to be torture. the next 3 months are going to be so long, just waiting to know if my baby is okay. i feel like it's my fault, like i did something wrong even though i'm actually doing better and healthier than i was with my last pregnancy. i want someone to understand this is scary for me and not to blow it off, but i feel like no one gets it. i guess i just needed somewhere to vent. i'm tired. i know there's nothing i can do either way and i hate feeling so helpless...	staroya	/r/Mommit/comments/n1ydcq/how_can_they_tell_me_not_to_stress_out/	5	2	0	0.75	1619802358.0
losing it with my 2 year old - need advice	im a sahm. my daughter is about 27 months old. im about to be induced with baby 2 on tuesday night. she has been acting out with just me for several weeks now...namely hitting, scratching, throwing things. usually this behavior occurs during meal times - its especially egregious if theres another adult talking to me and im not giving her my full attention. sometimes she does it anyway, laughing about it all the way. any advice? im obviously tired being this pregnant and baby 2 has a heart condition he will be coming home with. im just trying to help her adjust before we all have to adjust and not get exasperated with her. i dont believe in hitting, havent been successful with a time out regimen. i wasnt raised by compassionate parents, so im trying to learn as i go. thanks for your time and help.

mother's day crappiest gift suggestions	it's almost mother's day and i am surprised with the incredible gift suggestions that i have seen on stores and supermarket flyers, news, random media feeds and such. i opened up one of these 20 best gifts for mothers day and at least 3 were pots or frying pans, vacuum cleaners, pizza machine maker, cleaning set... it felt like however wrote it came from decades ago and thinks women belong in the kitchen and find fun in cooking and cleaning. seriously... as a grown up, i do appreciate household items that can be expensive, but a vacuum cleaner as mothers gift is as good as a car oil can gifted to a men... creativity zero, no one needed to see those lists to get these sexist stereotypes. am i wrong? what are your thoughts? is it just me or just here these kind of things?

i hate breastfeeding...and i need help	i've been breastfeeding for 3 weeks... i want to like it... financially it's the best option. i'd like to have this bonding experience with my baby... but i feel disgusted when i breastfeed. i've sat up nights just crying begging baby to finish, cursing god for making me this way, walking into the closet before the feed to scream and cry out my frustrations--- i simply hate breastfeeding but i don't really know how to overcome it or what to do. and because my baby is at an age where they need to eat literally all the time i can't recover from this feeling of being violated and angry. i don't mind breastpumping, but i never get the time to build supply to do it. baby will feed for over an hour sometimes, despite my efforts to keep them awake or provide a full feed... has anyone ever felt this way...? is there anything i can do...?	5683542006436	/r/Mommit/comments/n3pox9/i_hate_breastfeedingand_i_need_help/	20	5	0	0.78	1620023878.0

i'm new to baby boys so maybe i'm dumb but my son pees out the back of his diaper??	listen this is the weirdest thing. my son is about to be 6 weeks old. i put my son in a diaper that fits him, not too big, not too small. occasionally, like once a day or so, he will get this wet spot on his back at the top of his diaper that spans his whole back while he's sleeping or laying down. this happens in fresh diapers, diapers he took a nap in, it doesn't matter if they're wet prior or not. yes, i'm sure its pee. sometimes the diaper is basically dry and his back is soaked. yes, i make sure his lil sprinkler is facing down, not to the side or up. i thought maybe the diapers were too small so i moved him to a 2. he was borderline between 1 and 2 anyways. i've switched up the brands, it doesn't matter. what the hell is happening? my daughters never had this issue. am i doing something wrong? any advice? he sometimes goes through a few outfits a day because of this or he'll go a few days without the issue happening. i just don't get it!

can a baby forget or confuse who their mom is if they are frequently around another woman?	im a first time mom with a two month old. my mom has been coming over almost every day to help . she just wants to spend time with her grandson because she doesnt have much going on and he makes her so happy. thats fine, im glad that she is happy, but im going back to work in one month and she will be with him all day, every week day. when shes here she wants to feed the baby, burp him, change him, cuddle him, play with him.. literally everything. when my husband gets home, he misses the baby so he wants to do everything. i feel like im not even bonding with my own baby unless its a 2am and 5am feed. also im not breast feeding, were eff so i dont even have that connection with him. im worried that my baby will start to think my mom is his mom. is that crazy? edit to add that i will be talking to my mom about reducing her time here for my last month of maternity leave so i can bond more with the baby	Infamous-Parsnip-538	/r/Mommit/comments/n5jl39/can_a_baby_forget_or_confuse_who_their_mom_is_if/	6	13	0	0.94	1620230983.0
i would love to hear from mothers who are the supporting parent in your relationship.	i am looking to get some perspectives from mothers who are not the primary caregiving parent in their relationship. it's still very much ingrained in our culture that once women become mothers, they become the main parent when it comes to caregiving, mental labor, and house management, while men tend to be the partner that helps out or takes a bit of a backseat to parenting. i would love to hear from women who are in partnerships where this dynamic is reversed, and your partner is the one who takes on the lion's share of child rearing. how did you come to this arrangement? did your partner willingly take this role on or was it negotiated? do others comment on how you parent because it lies out of the norm ? what is your day to day like?

i think my baby needs a helmet for his flat head. advice needed.	hi mamas. my 2 month olds head is completely misshapen. its flat on the right side and the rightish side of the back. at his one month appointment, the pediatrician says it was slightly flat and to just do more tummy time and keep turning his head to the left side. well a month went by and its so much worse. we do the stretches every day to the left in case he has tight neck muscles. but he turns his head to the left with ease during those and when were playing to look towards me. he just likes to sleep to the right. we reversed everything in the house. his doc a tot so his left side now faces the window because he likes to look outside. his changing station so he looks at me or his dad towards his left now. i prop the right side of his head with something soft so he cant turn it when hes taking supervised naps. obviously i cant do that while we are all sleeping at night. he absolutely hates tummy time but we force it anyway and also spend time during the day with him on me and my husbands chests. but in his crib he just always turns his head back to the right at night no matter how much i move it to the left and i cant stay up all night to keep turning it. his head looks so bad. i feel like a failure. the pediatrician mentioned a helmet and im worried he will be upset and fussy having to wear it all day. does anyone have any experience with this?

any tips on flying with a 9 month old?	i need to travel home to visit an ill parent next month and my baby will be 9 months old. i will be traveling alone and the trip will take at least 2 connecting flights with about 8-9 hours of total travel time. any tips on how to travel with a baby? more specifically, i'm wondering should i bring a car seat or stroller with me? should i schedule a red eye flight so that baby is more likely to sleep during it or should i travel during the daytime so that i don't piss off other travelers who are trying to sleep themselves? can i buy a face shield or something for my baby? i'm formula feeding and my baby generally doesn't fall asleep at the bottle, so i anticipate an alert and overtired baby during travel. i'm also worried because we are going through the stranger danger phase and i'll have to sit next to someone we don't know....

what would you have wanted in my situation?	this was a while ago but for some reason i keep thinking about it. maybe there isn't a right answer and i can see why the my acquaintance did what she did. i was at the grocery store using the self-check out. we had been there too long and my toddler was done. she was crying and trying to get out of the seat. either the strap was broken or she could wiggle out enough that i kept having to sit her back in the seat in between scanning items. it was one of those that mom is struggling moments haha! then an acquaintance of mine comes up to me and says hi and offers to hold my daughter while i finish checking out. i was so grateful!! so she takes my daughter out of the cart and she goes into stranger danger mode and starts crying louder. the lady goes oh no! i'm sorry! and gives her back to me and walks away. so now i have to wrestle my screaming child back into the cart. then continue the struggle of finishing check out. so my question to you is how you would have felt in the situation? i personally wish she had held my daughter just a little bit longer, tried to distract her, just long enough so i could finish checking out. her giving her back to me, into my arms, right away just made the situation even harder for me. maybe she could have done the wrestling back into the cart? and then just made sure she was at least sitting while she cried haha! all the while i would have been working as fast as i could to finish. but i do see the other side, that the lady felt that she had just made things worse by making my daughter cry more. and her not wanting to be responsible for traumatizing my child. haha! and not wanting to wrestle another person's child. i don't blame her i just wish she had done things differently. but i was kind of like you saw that she was having a hard time if you aren't wanting to deal with a difficult child why did you offer to help? anyway, i would love to hear some thoughts from other moms. i would like to offer this help to other moms in the future and actually be helpful. but if a lot of moms feel the opposite of what i felt, i won't haha!	malaika_bustani	/r/Mommit/comments/n87utw/what_would_you_have_wanted_in_my_situation/	5	2	0	1.0	1620539731.0

i need some serious help/advice before i lose my mind!	so my oldest daughter freaks the eff out whenever my youngest daughter comes anywhere near her and i have no idea how to make it stop. when toddler sees baby crawling towards her or if baby pulls herself up to stand against the couch while toddler is sitting there, she will scream and start kicking and crying. you would think that the baby just punched her in the face or something, but no, she just made the mistake of looking at her. at first i thought it was just a phase since baby being mobile was so new, but shes been crawling for almost 3 months now and toddler still acts this way literally every time baby comes near. ive tried calmly explaining to her that sissy just wants to play with her and that its ok. or that if she doesnt want to sissy to be near her then she can go somewhere else. but you know, shes only 2 so i dont think she really understands. i think shes mainly just afraid that baby will take her toy or food or whatever away from her, but ive also tried to explain sharing, taking the object back if baby takes it , or even just keeping it away from baby and just not letting her take things from her. and ive tried those things more than just a couple times. but nothing has worked. lately ive been just removing baby from the situation and letting toddler just throw a fit till shes done. also tried not removing baby and making toddler just deal with it and figure it out on her own. but both still involve lots of screaming from both ends. its been about 3 months and the constant tantrums because of this has me ready to just break. toddler goes to daycare 3 days a week and apparently does great sharing and playing with all the other kids so i dont understand why shes having such a hard time with the baby. is there anything at all that i should be doing differently or try? or am i just going to have to deal with it until she finally realizes that baby isnt all that bad?

i need help	my son is 20 months old. over the last couple weeks he's been getting in trouble at day care a lot for hitting and biting and pulling hair. also noticed issues at home where he just gets really jealous over his big sister or even over the dogs and if they have something he wants or if they're spending time with me. the daycare told me this morning that another parent even threatened to pull their child out of class. obviously there is something my little guy is going through or dealing with and i just need help figuring out what it is and how to do better for him. i know one of my weaknesses as a parent and my husband and i have discussed this is discipline. not that he rules the house or we let him do whatever he wants but it's easier to turn on cars for the 1000th time or let him get into the refrigerator and pick out a snack whenever he wants than deal with the tantrum. and we do enforce some boundaries but i am wondering if maybe we should be more firm? more soft? i don't know what to do. to be clear we do tell him no and once hes been told no we do enforce that. like for example if hes about to do something dangerous and we tell him no hes very good at stopping and looking at us. i also wonder if there's some separation anxiety. i know that is a common issue at this age. we did the cry it out method for sleep training a year ago and now i am wondering if this has come back to bite us in the butt. if hes jealous and not feeling secure in his place does he need more of me? less of me? he used to go down to sleep without a problem but lately it's been taking him about 5 to 10 minutes of crying before he falls asleep. if he cries more than that or if his cry is at a level that i can tell hes very distressed i do go in and comfort him but it seems like i can't ever put him down and walk away without him crying. and he and i do spend a lot of time together when we're home. we play we hang out we do all kinds of things together until it's time for bed.	chis_and_whine	/r/Mommit/comments/nc6c6p/i_need_help/	4	3	0	1.0	1620991600.0
nearly 3 year old and the potty. advice?	we've exposed her to her own potty since 1. in feb. we did the no pants/ only panties 3 day potty training method. pros she used the potty multiple times! cons she prefers the diaper and asks for it. when we do not give it to her, she just doesn't drink anything. this let to horrible/ painful constipation. i am due in 4 weeks or less and i want my nearly 3 year old to use the potty, but everything i've read said that if they are not ready, don't push it or that could make matters worse. question is she being stubborn or is she not ready? what tricks can i use to help persuade her to use the potty? we've tried food, sleeping with mommy, and toys. thank you in advance for your tips, tricks, and suggestions.	dahliasteiner	/r/Mommit/comments/ncwnv7/nearly_3_year_old_and_the_potty_advice/	14	4	0	0.84	1621077750.0
how do i keep the house clean?	im a stay at home ftm and i always managed to keep the toys in the basket, and vacuum the house, clean the kitchen countertops and sink, make the bed and wash/dry cloths and fold them, etc. what i failed at doing was deep cleaning the pantry, cleaning washroom regularly, and just cupboards etc. my husband who works long work hours just started arguing about how i keep the very dirty and he cant believe he is living in a house like this. i always tried a keep the house clean on the surface but i agree the insides are not clean or organized. however i feel i literally do not get the time to do any deep cleaning. my 9 month old started getting super clingy and even before that she needed me constantly. whenever she napped i had a list of other things to do and deep cleaning was never even a thought. even when i sit and use my phone its while pumping. my lo isnt a bad baby she just needs attention constantly and i get exhausted. im writing this because i need tips on how to manage the house cleaning and the baby and have time for myself too. its just one baby i dont know why it is so hard	Areenkhalid	/r/Mommit/comments/nd13i9/how_do_i_keep_the_house_clean/	24	12	0	1.0	1621091685.0

hoping for advice on double strollers!	hi there, im an expecting mother - 19+3 with twin boys due in september! partner and i are both first time parents and feel particularly daunted by double strollers; im just wondering if theres any twin moms on here who could recommend a stroller? its the only thing we seem completely stuck on in terms of what we actually need. were based in the uk for reference and a lot of the ones we see online just dont seem available outside of the us. our car seats are fixed to the car so stroller would need to be independent of those / not be a travel system. we like the idea of side by side but dont know that its practical. partner wont get much time off work when they arrive so it needs to be something i can carry / navigate alone too. any help from any experienced mamas would be more appreciated than youd know!	invisiblekay	/r/Mommit/comments/ndjys7/hoping_for_advice_on_double_strollers/	4	1	0	1.0	1621154424.0

how are any of you guys managing to get anything done during the day??? seriously struggling with mom life.	new mom here, baby is 4 months old next week. i am seriously struggling with getting anything done during the day! she needs constant attention or she cries, and even when she does sleep its a 50% chance she will wake up if she is put down in her bassinet. not to mention she has medical issues and has a g-tube and colostomy bag that need to be cared for which make a lot of extra work. her feed bag needs to be flushed and refilled every 4 hours and her diaper changes take 2x as long because i need to empty the bag. i don't know how to get things done. i can barely get bottles sterilized and prepped for her. my husband works from home and is getting pretty annoyed with me always asking for help with small things. like how do you even go to the bathroom? make food? let alone household chores? i also have pets to care for. i'm really struggling. constantly feel like i'm drowning. it doesn't help that i haven't really dealt with any of the things that happened during her birth and after . i also think i might have ppd. i'm sorry this is basically just a vent post but can anyone share some tips or words of encouragement?? edit thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support . there are too many comments to reply to all but i honestly do feel much better about my situation right now. i am going to try to baby wear much more often and cut myself a little more slack! once gathering restrictions are lifted i will ask for more help from my mom. and call my doctor.

when/how to make the split into your own family unit?	maybe some of you can relate or have advice. ive expressed my boundaries multiple times and its not working. wondering if i should just cut ties, at least for a while. feeling triggered as today is my birthday and my mom called to wish me a happy birthday but spent most of the conversation trying to guilt me into inviting people to my babys first birthday- people that i just dont want to be there on top of trying to keep things small bc pandemic. i grew up in a family that celebrated every holiday with every aunt, uncle, cousin in attendance. sometimes second cousins too. this always overwhelmed me and created rifts as i was often excluded out of play with the other cousins and my grandmother favored them as well. i have vivid memories of this happening and my aunts, uncles, grandparents brushing me off. i dont feel super tight with my extended family because of this an none of them have gone out of their way to keep in touch as i got older. i am constantly guilted and made to feel in the wrong over not cultivating a relationship with them but my grandmother especially. its exhausting really. details aside-i feel absolutely zero need to introduce this extended family to my baby or to keep them involved in his life-since ya know-they werent involved in mine. i dont want my baby to grow up feeling stress at every holiday and social pressure to walk into a room and hug/greet 30+people. and i dont want these people to be super interested in him now, only to loose touch when hes not a shiny new baby anymore. i mean what do i do here? how have you navigated this or explained to your own parents that you are trying to start your own family unit with its own unique traditions etc.	limesqueeze22	/r/Mommit/comments/ne0lk4/whenhow_to_make_the_split_into_your_own_family/	4	3	0	1.0	1621206664.0
advice needed on maintaining the house while full time wfh with kids	im a wfh mom with two kids, 4 yo and 3 month. im married but my husband isnt really helpful when it comes to chores. weve been married for 7 years, its never been different and he wont change; this is something ive accepted. what im struggling with now is, since having our 3 month old and starting wfh last year, i have no idea how to maintain my home. im constantly behind on dishes, laundry and regular cleaning. i cant seem to find time or energy anywhere to do it all. i havent really been cooking dinners. my amazing mother had been providing us with two dinners a week. the rest of the week i usually manage to cook one meal. the rest of the week is leftovers, take out or sometimes i dont eat because im just too tired. im looking for advice on how to keep up with the mess and grime. ive tried doing one room a day and i get burnt out. i try to at least do one load of laundry a day but i cant seem to find time to fold the clothes. they just sit in a pile. i just feel like the house is a constant mess and i have zero extra time to clean. is there some trick im missing out on or is this just how it is with two kids and wfh? edit i need to give credit where credit is due. hubs will do something if i ask him, i just hate that i have to ask. he a super handy man. he will fix my car, he has fixed the washer. he cleans up the garage and takes care of the lawn. and hes a pretty good dad, he will make sure the big boy is ready for bed while im trying to get the little boy down. so he does a lot, just not a lot of the house cleaning or cooking dinners.	ladytapatopaste	/r/Mommit/comments/ne41ku/advice_needed_on_maintaining_the_house_while_full/	19	4	0	0.84	1621217346.0

how was your pregnancy stressful?	pregnancy should be a time of rest, low stress, and pampering, but for so many is isnt. life intrudes no matter what. it certainly did for me & sometimes when i see glowing bump pics online or women beaming around town in nice expensive maternity clothes i feel like the only one, and i feel robbed of something. i think it would help to hear from others who had it rough during those precious months, if youre willing to share. and, also, do you grieve anything about not having a peaceful time being pregnant? thx.

what kind of toys should you get for a 2 year old?	as my daughter's birthday approaches, we're needing and wanting to do a toy purge so we can get her new stuff. the purge part will be easy-- she basically doesn't play with anything anymore except a few of her snuggly plushies that she takes to bed or in the car. nothing else holds her interest. this means we will basically be starting over and getting a new collection of toys, and i have no idea what to get her. since she doesn't like any of the things we have currently, i'm at a loss as to what kinds of things she might be interested in. so, developmentally, what sorts of toys should we be looking at for a 2 year old? we currently have some play food with velcro in the middle for her to 'cut' with toy knives, and she likes that alright, so we're keeping it. we also have a shape sorter truck with little people that we're keeping because i know that kind of pretend play will happen sooner or later. she likes the shapes, but since she figured out where they go and how to get them in there, it doesn't interest her anymore. she gets bored once she really knows something. are there, like, general categories of toys we should be looking into? feel free to also drop specific recommendations if you have some, because just looking at the toy aisles in walmart gets me overwhelmed.

double stroller advice?	im due in august with my second child and my first will be almost 4. we walk a lot and take him in our single stroller constantly. it just occurred to me that a double stroller is going to be necessary pretty soon so i stopped at a local consignment store and now my head is spinning with the options and questions. so, fellow moms -what is easier to navigate a side by side or two in a line? - does it make a different to have a foot rest the full length of the stroller in the front or do you find that a triangular foot pad is fine? - is it difficult to maneuver with one heavier child on one side and then a baby on the other? any other thoughts would be much appreciated. this will probably be the biggest purchase we make since we have everything else we need and a good, easy to maneuver stroller will be necessary for us. thanks!!!	hiking_intherain	/r/Mommit/comments/neupso/double_stroller_advice/	8	1	0	1.0	1621292894.0

i need help with spiders	i live in california we recently moved into a new home last august. last year we found this huge spider in our kitchen but i thought it was once in a while. ive lived in california my entire life and grew up about 10-15 minutes from where we currently reside and never have i seen the size of spiders the way i saw that one. well fast forward to now. we have a soon to be 5 month old and its happened more than once in less than a month, where i see a huge spider inside our home. i have never been scared of killing spiders before but the size really freaks me out and i go in panic mode, especially with an infant at home. i would love to have tips and tricks in conquering this fear as well as how you all managed to kill spiders or remove them. it seems to happen all the time my husband isnt home and i am left alone with our baby and our dog, and im trying to manage my emotions as well as take care of a needy human. i end up waiting until he gets home or call him back to come and kill it because i cannot fester the strength to do it on my own. thankfully its been at the hours of when he just leaves or when hes about to get home but i dont want to end up one day by myself and no where near an hour that he can come and handle the problem. i am looking into an all pest control as we speak so that we can control the insects from coming inside.

where does your toddler hide things?	i have reason to believe that my 2.5 year old has taken and hid a thumbdrive that is very important to my work. i discovered it missing from my laptop on sunday. my four year old says that he took it out, put it under a pillow on the couch and then when he came back for it, it was gone and the pillow had been moved. so, i think that the little one toddled along, found the drive, took it and hid it somewhere. i do not believe she threw it out, as no other household members have observed her to put things in the garbage that don't belong there. we've basically torn the house apart looking for it and are running out of ideas. just want to see if anyone has any suggestions. we got encouraged that it has been hidden based on the fact that we just found one of her paw patrol figures squirreled away in my breast pump bag.

how do/did you know?	my whole life, since i was a kid, i envisioned having a family with two kids like my own family structure. husband also has the same sentiment as he is a twin and has an older sibling. we are 14 months in with our first little and i just can't see myself doing all of this over again any time soon. our little regularly has split nights and random naps and i feel like i'm struggling so hard with just her. everyone keeps saying it gets better and i'm clinging to that, while not so patiently waiting. i wish i was one of the moms who fell into motherhood with grace and calm, but i'm not. i'm also an introvert and the level of interaction a toddler needs is exhausting, even though i love most of it and love her more than i thought i ever could. it has been tough moving to staying at home and being responsible for pretty much all of her all of the time. with the pandemic, i feel so alone and overwhelmed without support from my now non-existent village i had previously pictured. i knew what came with having a child, i was ready for the commitment and embrace the challenges most days but it's so much harder than i thought it would be. i'm not sure what all i was intending to ask with this post, i guess just if you have more than one little, how did you know you could handle two , and how did you decide it was time to have another one? or, on the flip side, how did you decide one was a good number? did you reach a point where it got easier and felt able to do it all again? what all did you consider when making these decisions? it makes me sad to think we might be one and done, but i get anxious when i think about the changes that come with having a second and my own capabilities.	boredbutbusymom	/r/Mommit/comments/nh3n5f/how_dodid_you_know/	6	4	0	0.84	1621525603.0

how to transition back to work and feeding	my baby is 13 months. since she joined us mid-pandemic, we kind of winged it. i am a first time mom so i did what made sense for us at that time. that meant she never had a bottle and only fed at my breast since we were all locked down. this may seem like a no brained to many of the awesome moms here but i genuinely am not sure what to do. work has shared we will be returning to the office in 90 days. i am in a work from home position but i will need to travel to the office for 3 days. we plan to go as a family since we havent been able to get out much. regardless, ill be away from my daughter for at least 8-10 hours during the day if not 3 full days. how do i plan for this time when we wont be together at least the bulk of the day if not a few days all together? shes learning to eat more of her own meals but i still feed her at the breast about 3-4 times a day - typically to assist with falling asleep. i also have a pump. im not in a rush to stop breastfeeding. we have enjoyed it but i do want to make sure shes ready for when i fly to my work office and im away during the day. thanks for your help in advance.	jaejaeok	/r/Mommit/comments/nie5fl/how_to_transition_back_to_work_and_feeding/	3	3	0	0.8	1621672641.0

what is one really supposed to do during a sleep regression?	just be patient and try to wait it out?? my lo is now 8 months and has been a great night sleeper until these past few weeks... i honestly dont know what to do as the nights seem to be getting dragged out longer and longer after bath time. tonight its taken us over an hour to get her settled down in her crib. she wont stop moving, fidgeting, and waking herself up. she had a nice blw dinner, bath time, and a full feeding before putting her in the crib which she usually would be half asleep or full on asleep at this point of the night and no problem sleeping through the night. now shes fighting going down and she is waking several times during the night. help	selstepski	/r/Mommit/comments/njoiup/what_is_one_really_supposed_to_do_during_a_sleep/	1	3	0	1.0	1621826990.0
how do you deal with your and your partners hobbies?	we have a 7 month old, and finally feel we're staring to het the hang of this parenting thing, lol. which means we're starting to find time for our hobbies again. my husbands hobby is woodworking, he usually works out in the garage. which means i have baby when he's doing that, which is okay with me. i want my husband to have some time to himself. the problem is, my hobbies are knitting and baking. which means i'm still inn the house, and still very much available to both husband and child. and i get interrupted alllll the time, lol. i just want an hour to myself sometimes. knit in peace. i don't think my husband does it on purpose, but it just happens when i'm nearby anyways. he just needs to check something upstairs, or just needs to poop or whatever. or lo just sees me and wants me and nothing else. i just feel like it would be weird to lock myself in another room just to knit you know? edit thank you all for your insightful replies! hopefully we can find a solution that works well for both of us now. happy hobbying!!	i_am_lord_voldetort	/r/Mommit/comments/njwtaw/how_do_you_deal_with_your_and_your_partners/	17	29	0	1.0	1621859305.0
crib too big for our apartment! what to do?	we live in a 1br apartment and we have a 7m.o. daughter who outgrew her bassinet. we went to ikea yesterday, thinking to buy her a crib... but it looked enormous! it feels like it's a lot of room for a tiny baby. not to mention that we literally have no space where to put a crib that size. so we were considering two options 1. turning the walk-in closet into a nursery and put the full size crib in there 2. buy a mini crib and have a little more flexibility on where to put it, but we'll probably put it in the closet anyways... what do you guys think? getting a mini crib is probably a better option for a small apartment, as it offers the same functionality of a full size crib and it still has plenty of space for our daughter to grow in it. but it's also true that it's not as roomy and it probably doesn't make sense to buy an in between product, knowing that we'll need a bigger one in the future and it has a similar price point. not to mention that if the plan is to put it in the closet anyways, maybe the size doesn't matter anymore... but we are also a little worried about the idea of turning the closet into a nursery as it feels small and dark in there. maybe it's a better idea to get the mini crib and try to fit it somewhere in our bedroom? do you guys have any thoughts to share? what would you do? my husband and i are can't decide.	bieloanya	/r/Mommit/comments/nk3gng/crib_too_big_for_our_apartment_what_to_do/	5	1	0	1.0	1621877620.0
how soon after having a c-section did you get pregnant again?	hi everyone! i had a baby on march 1 with a c-section. because my husband and i are both older we will have to have our next baby soon. i was planning on trying to get pregnant again when this baby is around 10 months but i am scared about my c-section. my doctor said everything is fine and that he made things extra tight for this reason. anyone get pregnant under a year after a c-section? any problems? or smooth sailing? our first two are 19 months apart, so i know that i will be exhausted, but i will have help.	iteachrun	/r/Mommit/comments/nk3m0p/how_soon_after_having_a_csection_did_you_get/	7	1	0	1.0	1621878029.0
unplanned pregnancy and i am scared shitless. any wisdom, advice, etc. would be appreciated.	 thank you all so much for sharing your experiences and words of wisdom with me. after chatting with my doctor and therapist, and reading all of your stories and kind words, i've decided to become a mom! i'm still nervous and nauseous , but i know this is the right decision for me. --------------- hi everyone! i am kind of panicking right now because i've just found out i am pregnant. okay, i am totally panicking. needless to say, this was absolutely not planned and i definitely fall into that planner category. like, i am that person who creates a damn itinerary for their vacation listing our 5+ restaurant options. my partner is totally supportive and fine with doing whatever i want. the catch is that i have no idea what i should do and keep oscillating between keep it and don't. i am terrified of all the change this could entail if i keep it . i also fear having buyer's remorse if i decide not to move forward. i know i want to have kids, i just wasn't planning on doing it now. 30 sounded like a good time, but 28 and 30 aren't that distant? idk, i think i am just spiraling. any chance you all could share some of that golden mom, aunt, grandmother wisdom, advice, etc?

how much to plan a gender reveal?	so, we are having a gender reveal on sunday. most of the people invited will be 'here' on a zoom call and only a few will be in person. we are offering lunch as it will be early afternoon. the actual reveal part will be right at the beginning and i figured since the lunch will be more casual food people can eat when they want. my sister has bought the decorations and the reveal items and will be coming early to help set up. my husband has suddenly become stressed about planning it and i'm not really sure what else there is to plan. he hasn't mentioned wanting to play any games of any kind and honestly, i don't know of any specific to reveal parties. he also won't specify to me what exactly he still wants to plan. i told him i'd take care of it since stuff came up at work and he'll be working long hours. so, did any of y'all have more stuff going on at your reveal parties? if so, what? maybe i'm too laid back about it, but there doesn't seem to be much more to it to me.	babutterfly	/r/Mommit/comments/nmi22t/how_much_to_plan_a_gender_reveal/	6	1	0	0.6	1622150751.0
vent/advice needed	my lo has been a great sleeper generally and i know that my husband and i are super lucky for that. however, she was sick with a cold/bad cough sunday into monday and we got her checked out by the pediatrician who gave her cough medicine. lo slept well monday night and tuesday night, but wednesday night is when we had trouble. she went down ok for an hour or two around her normal bedtime, but then woke up and wouldn't sleep in her crib. just on me or dh. i took her for a few hours and then dh took her for a bit and managed to get her down in her crib around 2 30am. now here i am thursday and it seems like we're repeating last night. not sure if it's teething or her still getting over being sick but i hope she's getting better soon! i also miss going to bed at a decent time. any ideas why she may be so fussy at the moment? thanks for reading my vent!	rfardenaokr	/r/Mommit/comments/nmouxn/ventadvice_needed/	5	1	0	1.0	1622173094.0

struggling mom update	i posted a few days ago about my husband being upset that i didnt clean the house with a 6 week old in tow. everyone gave some great advice and i thank you for that! someone of you said that he sucked, and in that moment he did. he is a really a great man and im lucky to have him. my husband came home the other day and he apologized. turns out, he wasnt even mad about the cleaning. work is making him really mad and he is having trouble checking it at the door. he plans to start therapy soon to help with that. he told me i do more than enough and hes sorry for making me feel that i dont. the only thing that he was upset about was that i did say i would vacuum and i didnt. when i explained to him that i cant always get to housework depending on how the baby is, he said he understood. that he was having a hard time wrapping his head around that aspect and will try harder. sometimes he nit picks at other things when another thing is bothering him. his apology was sincere and ive moved on. i think sometimes i have to remember that this is an adjustment for him as well. i told him i will support him anyway i can. again, thank you all for your advice and help!

why am i feeling guilty even though i'm exhausted?	i decided to splurge on a deep clean for the house because i'm doing all i can to keep up with the everyday stuff. i was supposed to have minor surgery today and i had scheduled the cleaner for a week into my recovery. well surgery got rescheduled for next week and due to availability, c switched to the next saturday. i started rearranging storage shelves and cleaning the kitchen since today was a holiday and i had extra time. c rescheduled to tomorrow which was no problem since i just want to get it done. i took trash to the dump at 3am and stayed up till 4am to get everything put back together. i ran this morning, took the kids to the park, stopped at the store. now i'm looking around and feeling like i should be picking up around the house before c comes...to clean. am i a crazy person?? i'm typing this and seeing the logic of just letting it go, but i can't help feeling shame. i'm taking the day off work so i can be here while the house is cleaned and then pre-op in the afternoon. why is it ingrained in women to keep up appearances? it's a mental battle between needing extra help, getting it but still feeling bad. i don't know what's the point of this post.. mini vent i guess. thanks for reading.	jade868	/r/Mommit/comments/npkpxh/why_am_i_feeling_guilty_even_though_im_exhausted/	2	4	0	1.0	1622518330.0

credit where credit is due	this week i had my first night alone with my 4 month old. my husband went out of town for business for the night. my mom offered to stay with me in case i needed anything but i wanted to see if i could handle baby duties myself. i work full time too so i had to balance entertaining the baby, taking care of our dog, and prepping for work that night and the following morning on my own. we made it through the night in one piece but omg, i have so much respect for the families that do this every night. to the single parents, working parents, and anyone that doesnt fit into the typical family definition, i have so much respect for you. how people can take on a full time job, baby duties, keeping a home clean, and taking care of pets everyday on their own is beyond me. i tried it for one night and just barely made it through on my own. . to all of yall making it work, i see you, admire you, and am so proud.

daycare is concerned lo is not adjusting quick enough. need advice please!	we decided to try putting our 17mo into daycare 2 days/week to give her new experiences. i met with the daycare and really like them and was happy with the decision. well, it's been 3 weeks and the director came out to speak with me today about how our daughter is not adjusting and caring for a sad baby all day is hard, because we don't want her to be sad . they're suggesting putting her in for a third day, but that would mean signing a contract and being locked in for a year. what if she still doesn't adjust and hates it? she also complained that my daughter only wants to hold onto her blanket and they don't usually allow the kids to hold onto security items all day like that. every picture i get from the daycare is a picture of my daughter looking sad, but at the same time, i have noticed her communicating more and doing new things so she is learning while she's there. my fiance thinks they're only suggesting another day to get more money out of us because they really didn't allow enough time for her to adjust. i'm torn at what to do. do i just pull her from the daycare because she clearly doesn't like it, do i just give it more time to see if she adjusts, or do i put her in for an extra day and see if that helps?	sahria365	/r/Mommit/comments/nqx6t0/daycare_is_concerned_lo_is_not_adjusting_quick/	61	55	0	0.98	1622670144.0

advice on 22 mo nap if sick...	so last night my son woke frequently coughing and crying, a couple times of which required my assistance. so over the last 12 hrs he got not nearly enough sleep. he woke this morning at 4 30 coughing and crying so we just got him up because he wouldnt go back down. hes currently taking one nap at 12 30pm each day, but i know hes exhausted right now and dont think he will last that long. what advice do you have?i was thinking of putting him down at like 11? i dunno im tired to, and need someone else to think for me hahahah disclaimer we are going to call the dr and take all medical advice. we had covid about 1.5 mo ago and are fully recovered. my biggest concern is what to do today with his sleep, but be assured that if he needs to get tested he will be tested, and i will take him for all medical assistance needed. im a textbook worrier and super supporter of western medicine and vaccines tia!	coffeetablelife	/r/Mommit/comments/ns1m2e/advice_on_22_mo_nap_if_sick/	11	3	0	1.0	1622801419.0
special needs mom who has to make the world rotate	hi everyone. i am going through a lot right now, and just thought i would reach out. my daughter has a chronic condition that makes it hard to work. meanwhile, there is a lot of expense associated with her condition. it has been a nightmare trying to get her proper treatment. meanwhile, when i became a mother, every person in my life showed their true colors. they are gone. i am alone, and we are fine, but mentally my anxiety is constant. constant. while i feel that my daughter will be fine, healthy and happy, in the long run, i think i am feeling more pressure to bring in money. on the other hand, finding a sitter who gets it is like trying to build a bridge with a qtip and a toothpick. every time i try to make something work, it blows up in flames. i just wish things would go in the right direction, for my daughter mostly, but for me as well, so i could just feel calm again. thanks.

please help if you can	i had an unplanned c-section 5 days ago with my first baby. long story short, i made it all the way to 8cm dilated and then stopped progressing. they tried everything in the book to get me to 10 but once i started feeling pressure and like i needed to push while still only at 8, my dr decided that c-section was best. afterwards, my doctor explained that while she was inside me , my spine was so pronounced that she could poke it through my uterus. she explained that the reason why i didn't make it to 10cm was because baby couldn't fit through the space between my spine and pelvis. she said that i will likely never be able to have a vaginal birth because of this aspect of my body. obviously i'm happy my baby is here and we're both safe and healthy, but i'm still pretty devastated by this news. i had no idea about any of this before hand. i've never had back problems, passed every scoliosis test i've ever had, basically never realized that my lower back would prevent me from vaginal births and that i never had the choice to begin with. is there anyone out there who has the same problem or something similar? i've heard of mom's who had to do c-sections due to their pelvis being too small for baby, but i've never heard of anything being because of a pronounced spine. i plan on getting a second opinion and doing research, maybe seeing a chiropractor but i honestly don't even know where to begin. i'm not against having c-sections for future children i may have, but i would like the peace of mind that i've done everything i could research wise and exhausted all other options.	megb42	/r/Mommit/comments/ntdj6z/please_help_if_you_can/	4	3	0	1.0	1622953793.0

need advice for a pre-schooler.	i thought babies were tough. now that ive got basic needs, routine and a positive teaching method, now i also have to teach him how to respond appropriately to the ills of the world?? need advice. son just turned 4 and started at a new daycare. i trust the daycare a lot, my mother-in-law was on the board and my husband and all his sibs went there and had a great time. same people still work there, running the place. since my son started there 3 weeks ago he has been telling me is hair is too spiky, he wants me to cut it off and he is really attached to wearing his hat even indoors. he also tells me that other kids hit him. i cant tell if its a regular occurrence or a story he is re-hashing. he is an only child raised in a pandemic and i wouldnt be surprised if he is taking toys from other kids, not in a mean way, just in a he doesnt know the rules sort of way but i just dont know. the daycare has asked me if he is an only child and responded with a sort of that explains it when i said yes. they havent said anything about the hitting though. ive of course tried my best to give him helpful instruction, to say to kids dont hit me and to go tell a teacher if they do it again. ive told him his curly hair is beautiful and i would honestly respect if he preferred to have jt shorter for personal preference but i dont want to ignore the possibility some kid may be telling him there is something wrong with his hair. is he being bullied? hes 4 so he can only explain things in a limited way. what would you do?

weird question does anyone else have lingering stabbing pain for years after their c-section?	our youngest was born 3yrs ago and my partner is still having stabbing pain in her incision, to a point where it hurts her to bend normally, do many yoga poses, or sleep in certain positions. she's pretty sure there's something wrong with the incision. originally the ob said it was nothing but she could consult a plastic surgeon and we were kind of irked they seemed to dismiss her very real pain as being some kind of cosmetic complaint. also, plastic surgery is super expensive so even if she wanted to go that route to see if it did help, we doubt insurance would cover it. does anyone have experience here? ideas on solutions?

how to scare solicitors 	if anyone can understand this, i know its my fellow moms. my daughter is 8 months old and has three teeth coming in. she is having an absolutely awful time taking her naps despite my best efforts and tylenols helping hand. as you know well, babies who dont nap have mommies who dont get a break. this is the fourth day in a row of unusual night wakings and bad naps. today she couldnt nap at all for her first nap. were both tired and cranky. i finally get her down for her second nap. shes sleeping like an adorable, somewhat small log. thank goodness. i finally get a break. i relax on the couch and fold some laundry while watching tv. yes, i know what youre thinking. this lady knows how to party! anyway, out of the corner of my eye,i see a shadowy figure through the window that flanks the front door. i panic. if this person knocks at my door, the dog will bark and wake the baby. i jump over the side table next to the door to try to head him off. alas, i am too late. he knocks at the door. my voice rumbles in low tones at the dog to be quiet. i open the door, the dog barks again and this man looks at me. the baby lets out a wail. i look at this man, he starts to say something, and i burst into hot noisy tears and almost collapse in the doorway, telling him this was the only time the baby slept all day. he said he was sorry and backed away stumbling. he nearly ran. i dont think hes coming back. i shut the door and shook with rage. the kind of rage a mother feels when she has spent all day putting forth her best effort to an understandably fussy baby and someone else comes around and donks up her only time to rest. then rage cried some more. after a few moments, i picked up my baby and tried to get her to sleep. nope. so random awkward man, i hope you never darken my door again. obligatory apologies for mobile formatting.

what was one thing that caught you completely off guard about being a mom for the first time/postpartum first time?	there were lots of surprises for me postpartum and there are so many lessons every day , but one thing that no one told me about and absolutely shocked me was fully peeing my pants almost every time i stood up. for days. one person gave me a very meaningful look as she recommended i buy a pack or two of depends. im so glad i took the advice. i had zero bladder control for almost a week! and its definitely not back to normal yet, though thankfully improving. what is one thing that completely caught you off guard about the postpartum/new mom period?	korthlm	/r/Mommit/comments/nvlvyl/what_was_one_thing_that_caught_you_completely_off/	14	3	0	0.81	1623208420.0
what the help?	hi everyone, i'm new here, have an 8-month old and was wondering how everyone else has navigated the support with your partners when it comes to all things third human in the house . i love my hubby very much, but honestly since the pregnancy i've felt like i'm doing this mostly on my own. that's probably not true and he does do a lot but that's what it feels like to me. it's the little things like all the pre-baby buying had to be done my me, imagine cott and furniture building alone while pregnant, trips to ikea on weekends alone for coat hangers and mattresses. even since baby was born it feels like i'm 'asking for help' instead of jobs being shared equally. it's like he baby sits instead of taking full joint responsibility for things. at this point i feel i should mention he does deal with some anxiety and at times depression and is very slowly taking steps to manage this after a couple of years of denial. i am very supportive of him doing this, very understanding of him needing space and time to himself. to his credit, he mostly does his own laundry, keeps his things tidy most of the time, cooks half the meals, takes care of the yard and mostly looks after the dog, but i guess i feel like i do the same for myself, plus the general house things and now for the little one as well. i've tried to talk to hubby about it while not overwhelming him, i offer for him to think about what he would like to be involved with and then to do it consistently, but it doesn't seem to happen. i've also gone back to work 3 days a week since baby was 5 months old and don't feel like he's increased any of his workload to compensate for the fact that i'm not 100% baby focused now and also have other responsibilities. never mind the fact that i feel like our relationship is literally the lowest thing on his priority list. am i alone here? am i being unreasonable? has anyone else dealt with this and got through it? what were your strategies? any advice would be so appreciated! tl/dr don't feel like husband is sharing baby and life responsibilities equally with me and feeling like i'm almost doing this as a single parent.	focused_pineaple	/r/Mommit/comments/nvm4t5/what_the_help/	12	5	0	1.0	1623209263.0

my mother is passively talking bad about me to my baby?! please help . what is going on	i am 32 years old, married woman and have a 15 month old baby girl. my mother and i have always had some what rocky relationship but lately we have been getting along. she communicates with my daughter mostly via facetime and only very rarely in person. well when she talks to baby she says things that bother me. i know my daughter doesnt understand yet but this type of talk is annoying to me and when my daughter does understand, i dont want this type of jokes to be mentioned around her. for example, my mother says things like oh poor baby, she didnt feed you today? is she annoying you? she just sits around all day and you have to fend for yourself? come over to my house and eat ice cream did she make you fresh food or you have left over from yesterday? and mind you all of this is being said as in a fun joking way but it bothers me. today she said something even more ridiculous and she directed it at me. while my baby was blabbing away on facetime my mother says to me oh wow you must have really got in her nerves today! look at how shes blabbing so loud! basically saying that my daughters loud blabbing must be her complaint to my mother about how much i annoyed her . another thing that really annoyed me was a couple of weeks ago when we visited my mothers home, she was giving my baby ice cream. i told her that i dont allow her sweets but i guess a few bites is fine. once i saw that my baby had enough ice cream and it was time to move in to something else, i told my mother to stop giving her the ice cream. but she continued to give her more for the next 20 minutes. a little here and there. i kept telling her its weight but she would just ignore me completely. since we have a rocky history i dont want to argue or have confrontations with my mother so i just let things be or laugh them off but its getting to the point where i think she is toxic. and her bringing my daughter into her toxic jokes is a no for me. please what do you think is going on? is this normal and i am over reacting?	mx25sh	/r/Mommit/comments/nwsaic/my_mother_is_passively_talking_bad_about_me_to_my/	21	28	0	0.98	1623343601.0

how to explain cultural appropriation to your kids	in this article what is cultural appropriation? common examples of cultural appropriation how to avoid cultural appropriation with kids cultural appropriation is a hot-button issue that is often misunderstood. like all the big, uncomfortable topics that can be daunting to explain to children, we are not always armed with the exact right words the moment we need them. but now, perhaps more than ever, it is vital that parents take the time to learn about this complex issue and have honest discussions at home. &; talking about race and culture with your kids demystifies the discussion and helps children understand and respect cultures outside of their own. if you're worried about how to approach this issue with your children, here are some ways you can explain cultural appropriation to your kids. &; what is cultural appropriation? in order to explain something as nuanced as cultural appropriation, parents must first understand the issue before breaking it down in a way that's easily digestible for young minds. &; cultural appropriation, as defined by verywell mind, refers to the use of objects or elements of a minority culture in a way that doesn't respect their original meaning, give credit to their source, or reinforces stereotypes or contributes to oppression. &; african americans, asian americans, native americans, and hispanic americans are the ethnic groups most commonly impacted by cultural appropriation in the united states. while it may not seem like a big deal to let your white child dress up as moana or wear their hair in cornrows, in actuality, what they are doing is borrowing from a culture that has been historically oppressed. &; as crystal raypole of healthline writes, for white people, addressing cultural appropriation involves doing some potentially uncomfortable work. acknowledging all elements of a culture extends to recognizing how white supremacy and racism have played a part in dismantling and oppressing other cultures. common examples of cultural appropriation while cultural appropriation as a concept may seem straight-forward, often times in practice it can be more confusing. there are many ways in which society appropriates traits from minority cultures and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, often without realizing it. &; common examples of cultural appropriation include &; 1. ethnic holidays while americans gather every may 5th to celebrate mexican independence by eating mexican food and drinking margaritas, this holiday is actually not a thing in mexico. seriously. so if you do decide to celebrate mexican culture with your family, here's how you can celebrate cinco de mayo respectfully. &; other holidays that perpetuate negative stereotypes include st. patrick's day and thanksgiving. this is not to say you cannot celebrate these days, only that you should take the opportunity to learn about the origins of the holidays and discover ways in which you can celebrate respectfully with your family. &; 2. costumes if you're unsure if a halloween costume is an example of cultural appropriation, ask yourself if it represents a culture other than your own. if you would need to darken or lighten your skin, change the color of your hair, add physical markings like tattoos, or wear another culture's traditional clothing or hairstyle, it is culturally insensitive. &; when my daughter wanted to dress up as pocahontas for halloween, i struggled with how i would explain to her that it wasn't the right choice, mom-of-three sharon r. told mom.com. i had introduced her to all my favorite disney movies from my childhood and i knew this was a character she loved. &; but i also know that as a white child, dressing up as a native american character is not appropriate, sharon continued. i did my best to navigate the conversation and while i'm not sure she totally understood, it is a start. in the end, she was very happy with her fairy costume! &; 3. hairstyles and fashion from kim kardashian's cornrows to katy perry dressing as a geisha, we are constantly inundated with images of celebrities borrowing from other cultures in ways we may not immediately recognize as being offensive. but when dominant cultures take aspects of non-dominant cultures, they are adopting elements of their history without any of the negative ramifications. how to avoid cultural appropriation with kids as adults, we understand complex issues like racism and oppression and how minority cultures have been exploited throughout history. but children are not born with that context. which is why it can be extra tricky to explain why cultural appropriation is bad and how it can be avoided. &; when faced with an instance of cultural appropriation, here's how you can begin to navigate that conversation with your child. &; 1. first, ask them why this is important to them. whether a child wants to dress as a certain character, wear their hair a certain way, or is speaking in an accent they heard on tv, remember that children learn by osmosis. they are absorbing the world around them and picking and choosing what sticks out to them. they are not likely aware that their choice could be offensive to others and so it's important not to dismiss an idea without first discussing why it's important to them in the first place. listen to their reasons and use that as a jumping off point for the conversation. &; 2. discuss the context of that piece of culture together. if it is a topic you understand well, discuss it with them. if not, take the time to research the origins together. in the simplest of terms, talk about the history and the people behind this piece of culture. &; 3. explain how other cultures are treated differently. children learn early on that while everyone should be treated the same, this is sadly not the case. treating others with kindness and respect extends to honoring their cultures. &; 4. offer alternative suggestions. now that you've laid the groundwork and emphasized the importance of respecting other cultures, offer alternative suggestions for them to consider. &; 5. treat this as an opportunity for growth. issues regarding race and culture will not be understood by children after one discussion. even as adults, most of us still have a lot we will continue to learn in time. the important thing is that you lead by example and continue to be open to growth yourself. by doing this, you will instill in your children an appreciation and respect for others.

what do you all do for work?	i am a sahm and i also wfh about 30 hours for this small business. i used to come in before covid and the baby and work there full time, ive worked here about 6 years now. covid happened and now i have a 1 year old who i take care of all day while finding time for work. i do a lot at work, and it is stressful! lately things are not getting done in time, according to my boss, even tho i feel i am busy and doing everything i possibly can. with my now toddler and work i am over stressed. the job pays well. even with the 30 hours i get a week. i want to quit, but i am having trouble finding jobs that pay the same or even close to that. another thing is i dont have childcare options. i dont have family where i live, and daycare is way out of my price range, worse if i take a lower paying job. my husband is very supportive and says he will step up but it is hard for me to just let go. ive worked since i was a teenager and have always earned my money. anyways, you working mamas out there, anyone else in a similar situation? i would appreciate any feedback.	pris_mar	/r/Mommit/comments/o2snmj/what_do_you_all_do_for_work/	5	2	0	1.0	1624032546.0

how do you and your partner split the work of maintaining your home and kids?	basically the title - i'm really struggling with adjusting to having two kids and the amount of work it takes to keep up with them and the disaster they naturally create. i feel like i'm doing 90% of the work - cooking, cleaning, shopping, appointments, sports, school, daycare etc., and my husband only steps in when specifically asked/ defaults to me to be in charge of the kids when we're not working. i'm exhausted from needing to constantly give him a to do list or asking him to spend time with the kids so i can do some chores. i've tried talking with him about it, but he always takes it as an attack, and things will get better for a few weeks and then just goes back to all being on me. i think it's mostly because he's unaware of how much work i'm doing and how often it's being done. what works well for you and your partner to divide and conquer?	vigilantspectator	/r/Mommit/comments/o4e8by/how_do_you_and_your_partner_split_the_work_of/	8	5	0	1.0	1624220700.0
how to calm fears of dying during childbirth	i had a really traumatic emergency c section 7 years ago. i'm scheduled for my second one in a couple months. i'm terrified of dying. is this normal or do i have a sixth sense that something bad is going to happen? i think one of the biggest reasons i'm so terrified is bc my 7 year old daughter will go to her bio dad if i die. this would be a horrible situation for her and there's nothing i can do other than ask my husband to flee the country with her . i can't die. how do i remedy this all-consuming anxiety and fear?	wtf_kinda_world	/r/Mommit/comments/o4v1l6/how_to_calm_fears_of_dying_during_childbirth/	18	34	0	1.0	1624281786.0
what to do with babe while working out?	apologies if this isnt the right sub. let me know if theres somewhere else i should post this. my babe is 8 months old. able to crawl, sit, cruise, the works. im sure its only a matter of one to two months before she walks independently. for that reason im struggling with how to contain her while i workout in our garage gym. i have a walker but she sprints away as soon as i put her in it. shes too active for the rockers/swings and just tries to escape them . she stands up in her portable bassinet and could easily tip out of it. her high chair is ok but she gets bored after about 15 minutes and its awkward to move. the pack and play we have works, but we use it indoors as a changing table surface and its a pain in the butt to move it in and out of the house. ill gladly buy another, but before i spend money i want to make sure theres nothing better on the market. i was thinking one of those portable octagonal play areas maybe? i dont know. any ideas other than a pack and play to keep my active kid contained and entertained for 45 minutes a day?

am i being selfish when it comes to my grandparents?	im a sahm with our two boys, ages 1 and 2. last september , we moved to our new house in a small town. coincidentally, my grandparents moved into a semi-assisted living facility within walking distance about a month later. my mom is pretty much their sole caretaker. her sisters dont help much. my grandpa has alzheimers thats been worsening lately and my grandma has a variety of health problems. both have mobility issues. my mom is retired, but she has to do a lot for them like taking them to doctors and shopping and helping with some personal care. the thing is, ive never liked my grandparents. theyve always been self-centered and played favorites with me and my cousins when they were younger. my grandma gets into these moods where shes depressed and mean to everyone around her. i have some pretty awful childhood memories of her just being rude and miserable. she refuses to consider any sort of mental health help. anyway, she loves my boys. i think shes borderline obsessed with them. she doesnt really have anything else to do, i guess. the thing is, i dont really go to visit. she wants me to pick her up and bring her to my house sometimes to see them, but i dont do that either. she got into a snippy mood the last time i saw her, and she snapped at my 2 year old for refusing to hug her . i felt like i did when i was a kid and she would do that to me. luckily my 2 year old didnt notice, but i felt bad. anyway, i dont really see them and i dont help out with them. yes, im busy with my kids, but also, i dont want to. i feel like im being selfish because my mom is really busy with them and im so close, but i dont want to see them. i also feel like im being selfish for keeping my kids from them because they love my kids and my kids should know their great grandparents. should i just suck it up and go see them more anyway? am i being selfish?

toddler sleep advice	my almost 3 year old has been sleeping with us since she was 1. every time we try to get her to sleep in her room she loses her mind. we just want to get her sleeping in her own room. we now have a 2 month old so its become a nightmare for bedtimes. we decided to start with napping in her room and then push bed time once she stopped getting upset about napping in there today she napped in her bed instead of ours for the first time so i rewarded her. then tonight at bed time we all laid down and she asked to sleep in her room so i said absolutely but explained that i wasnt going to sleep in there. she asked to watch a show so i cut on a 30 minute timer thinking whats another 30 minutes shes in her own bed ! once it ended she started screaming her head off . full blown tantrum like ive never seen well i decided to let her cry it out and just reassure her by taking through the monitor, she finally went to sleep after about 45 min. am i horrible for letting her scream and cry?! any advice or tips?? side note im only pushing this finally because i remember being the same way as a kid and once i became school age and friends had sleepover parties i was always the kid whos parents had to be called because i was too afraid it was so embarrassing . any advice is welcome	WhatAmIDoingHere515	/r/Mommit/comments/o6qyvn/toddler_sleep_advice/	2	1	0	1.0	1624499201.0

help me!	help. i am so tired, like so incredibly tired i cant even express it properly. i am 32 weeks pregnant with a 19 month old who wont sleep. bed time is around 7 every evening, this normally means asleep for 7.30. i try to get her up at 7 every morning but have failed a few times recently due to sheer exhaustion and let her sleep til 8, shell never sleep past 8. she naps at around midday and will often nap for 2 full hours, sometimes 2.5. recently this time has been so valuable to me to allow myself to rest, although this seems to be an active time for baby so he kicks constantly and i cant sleep. my tiredness is having a knock on effect, mostly in the form of far too much screen time. im conscious that this may be the case after baby arrives too and im just at a loss. she will wake at night and it can be for hours at a time. she is rarely upset or crying during these times, but is very noisy and will bang and rattle the sides of her cot and shout and babble to herself, which obviously wakes me. we have a good bedtime routine, no screen time before bed, same two books and same song every night, she goes into cot awake and successfully settles herself with no upset, normally within 10 mins or so. same for naps. at night i try to only go in to her if shes actually upset, otherwise i try to weather it out and see if shell settle herself again. i cant keep this up though, im just too tired. im having constant kidney infections and i honestly think lack of sleep is affecting my health. any and all tips are very welcome! ! tyia!	busyboobs	/r/Mommit/comments/o7jxnf/help_me/	4	5	0	0.86	1624611663.0
advice on our nap schedule?? please & thank you d	6 months, hugely protesting 3 naps so we just dropped to 2. goal is the following wake windows 2h45m 3h15m 3h30m - 3h45m problem is for the last 4 weeks she keeps waking between 5 and 545am which means if i follow that schedule she'd be going to bed super early. so i start the clock on her wake window when i get her out of bed at 6 meaning sometimes that wake window can actually be 3h45m. anyway, she has been hella cranky from morning to nap 1 and from nap 2 until bed and is normally a very happy baby. for whatever reason she's super happy between nap 1&2. bedtime is usually 630 and asleep by 645-7. any advice that could help with the crankiness or early mornings?	elliebellybaby	/r/Mommit/comments/o8mekw/advice_on_our_nap_schedule_please_thank_you_d/	3	1	0	0.67	1624753311.0
please help - sleep with 9 week old	today has been one of the hardest days since having my son. hes 9 weeks old today. a week ago we transitioned him out of the swaddle and into a zipadee-zip. for 5 days he slept really well in it, even better than in the swaddle . then 2 nights ago he wouldnt go down at 8 - my husband and i tried for 3 hours to put him down and finally he fell asleep at 11 pm. then all night he would only stay asleep for 30 mins or so in his bassinet - he would only sleep longer stretches on us. last night we were able to get him down at 8 . however, he still would only stay in the bassinet for about a half hour at a time and ended up sleeping in our arms all night, which meant one of us had to be holding him. both nights my husband held him from 11 pm-4 am while i slept and i took 4-9 am. both nights its been impossible for me to stay awake. i drink coffee, try to walk around with him when i feel tired, but this morning for instance, the moment i sat down to give my back a rest i fell asleep with him in my arms and had a full on dream that i was in my room. then i woke up, probably just a couple minutes later if that, and became really startled and confused. it scared me that i had lost consciousness essentially and felt out of control. im so scared i will drop my baby in this state. all day ive been anxious about it, im dreading tonight. i worry that my husband will do the same thing so its even hard for me to think about sleeping from 11 pm-4 am. i just dont know what to do at this point. ive been crying all day. my anxiety is getting in the way of me eating, interacting with my baby - im just obsessing about sleep. i guess im just looking for support or words of wisdom, maybe advice if someone else has been through this before and found some kind of hack or sleeping arrangement that makes this easier or less scary? this newborn stage is so hard.	illeshamarie	/r/Mommit/comments/o8mf7q/please_help_sleep_with_9_week_old/	17	5	0	0.86	1624753384.0

little girls and little men - why??	i'm in a few parenting groups, and have noticed an odd trend of referring to babies/toddlers as little girls if female, or little 'men' if male. what's up with that? why can't little boys just be little boys? being a man is a long, long way - and isn't it sweet that we have those years in between to cuddle and play and show unbridled affection, in ways that will probably embarass a grown-up son? i only have a little girl, so i suppose the trend doesn't directly affect me, but i do find myself pretty baffled at this tendency to make male babies sound more big/grown up. just think how weird it would sound to say 'had a lovely day at the park with our little woman!' seriously, let's embrace having little boys/girls and not rush them into growing up.

advice? has this happened to you?	so my daughter turned one in may and had her 1y/o shots june 15th. including the mmr. a few days ago she started breaking out a little bit on her face but we though it was just from spit. a few days went on and it started getting worse. it started spreading really bad to her face and chest so we took her to the pediatrician. they said it was an, uncommon, about 5% chance, reaction to the mmr vaccine. we left it at that and have been keeping an eye on it. she has no fever, plenty of healthy diapers frequently. but now, it has gotten awful. her entire body is completely covered. at first she didn't notice but she's started to itch it. she's also sleeping a lot more than normal and not eating. when she's awake she's acting normal but gets tired quickly and sleeps about 3+ hours at a time. her grandma wants to try infant benadryl but i don't know if it will work? should i take her to the er? has anyone else had this happen? ftm not sure what to do. edit she is eating a little bit but not nearly as much. also her last appointment she was 201bs. 12oz. at her checkup the other day she was 19lbs 10oz. update i called her pediatrician and he said we can bring her back tomorrow morning. she doesn't have red tongue or lips and no swollen lips so no er. is there anything i can do to help the itch? i know someone said no benadryl?

sahms, how do you deal with having no money?	our kids are 6.5m, 4.5f, and 1m, and i used to have a part- time job as a preschool teacher until my last baby was born. i planned to go back after 8 weeks, but covid shut down my school, and we decided to homeschool our big kids this year since our oldest had asthma and our youngest was an infant. whenever my husband gets angry at me, though, he loves to remind me that he pays for everything because i'm unemployed. and i don't know what to say back because it feels so unfair, but technically he is correct. all the money we have comes from his job. how do you deal with this? does your partner give you an allowance? how do you deal with the shame and embarrassment of not earning any money? i try to tell him that he'd have to pay someone a lot of money to teach and care for the kids, to do all of the cooking and cleaning every day, but he says that's the most ridiculous thing he's ever heard and that's what moms do if they love their kids, which i obviously do. i am going back to my job in september, but until then i hate that he gets to hold this over my head. am i being entitled to think that his money is the family's money?	txgrl308	/r/Mommit/comments/o9xsiv/sahms_how_do_you_deal_with_having_no_money/	382	479	0	0.98	1624928978.0
when did you let your little sleep with a blanket?	i have a 14mo daughter and our house is old so sometimes our air conditioner has a hard time keeping up with the summer heat, mainly because our living has big bay windows so we have a lot of sunlight throughout the day. its currently 74 in our house with the air running, itll get cooler over night. we usually keep our house at 69 and she sleeps in short sleeve pajamas and a sleep sack. tonight, i have her in just a onesie and socks, and was going to lay her down with a muslin blanket since they are breathable and i just need reassurance its safe im such a hover mom and i hate it, but i cant help but to constantly worry especially since she is my first baby. when did you feel comfortable to put your child to bed with a light blanket?	swikoff96	/r/Mommit/comments/o9yera/when_did_you_let_your_little_sleep_with_a_blanket/	15	2	0	0.76	1624931256.0

considering a career jump but feeling so much guilt about time away from baby - would appreciate advice!	let me preface this by saying i know i am so lucky in my life and im not trying to garner sympathy but i really would appreciate hearing your thoughts and advice on the situation. i dont have any mom friends yet . i am super conflicted and feel super guilty. my son is 6 months old and its been an absolutely amazing time with him after dealing with ppd early on im finally feeling like myself and totally in love with him. he was exclusively breastfed and started solids about a month ago and we are trying to get him to start the bottle. i pump a bit as well to help with the transition but its taking a lot longer than expected. recently ive had an amazing job opportunity come my way though im on mat leave and have a year left. before baby i wouldnt have hesitated - making more money and an extra week of vacation? hell yeah! but it will be busy while working from home and going to the office later and itll also require european travel when its allowed. being a mother to my son is the best thing in my life but i dont want to regret taking this career jump when hes older. my mom regrets it and i kinda miss the sense of accomplishment i had at work. im also the primary earner in our house so with this raise we wont be living paycheque to paycheque and can actually start saving and consider baby 2. after the long lead up i was wondering - working parents, how do you manage it???? i feel guilty for even considering the offer but i am definitely interested because ive gone through the interview process and have the offer in front of me. my husbands work has busy periods and long hours but he has a late start most days so can take the mornings. my mil lives with us for now so she can help with some baby stuff my clients would be in europe so i can adjust my work timing a bit according to the company but i still feel so guilty and worried that im a bad mom for going back earlier when im lucky to have a great mat leave in canada and the luxury of spending time with him longer. i feel so so bad for you guys that have no choice but to go back so soon. did any of you choose to go back early? how do you balance baby time? i miss him already but i think ill be a better mom for it? feeding? how do you balance home life and travel? how do you deal with mom guilt???	andyougetacar	/r/Mommit/comments/oabo2k/considering_a_career_jump_but_feeling_so_much/	3	3	0	1.0	1624983777.0
8 month old terrified of new plushie, no idea why. has this happened to anyone else?	our 8 month old loves the little blue truck books. my partner decided to buy a stuffed version of the truck, which is soft and a decent size and makes the horn beep sound when you squeeze the cab. after reading the book the other day, we brought out the toy and showed him. we thought he'd be so excited, but instead, he desperately tried to get away from it and started hysterical crying. this is the first time he's had a fear response to anything, and for the life of me, i can't figure out why he was so scared. it seemed like he made the connection to the book , because he kept looking at the book, then back at the toy, then back at the book, etc. his fear was also pretty extreme - he was trembling and kept trying to crawl away or climb up one of us. i'm mostly looking for answers so we can hopefully avoid it happening again with something else. poor kid was a mess, we felt awful! has anything similar happened to you or anyone you know?? edit thank you for all the feedback! i guess i thought these kinds of fears didn't show up until a little later, but it sounds like it's normal at this age. hopefully we can reintroduce the toy slowly over time and help him work through it. thanks for reassuring this ftm! edit 2 i'm cracking up at how many posts include or end with, kids are weird, and an implied shrug. i'm sure it only gets weirder as they get older, and i'm here for it!	supremelypedestrian	/r/Mommit/comments/oamg8i/8_month_old_terrified_of_new_plushie_no_idea_why/	33	61	0	0.98	1625016536.0
i dont know what to do anymore	my baby will not sleep. not at night. not during the day. im going insane. im in tears right now. i am so tired and just lost at this point. ive tried everything. our routine hasn't changed. its been the same since he was born. i've tried sleep training. sleep sacks. loveys. white noise. music. singing. putting him in our bed. everything. he just whines and rolls around and sits up and slams his head into the sides of the crib or on the bed. tries to crawl off the side of our bed. i just. i give up. hes so cranky, you cant do anything with him. i dont know what else to do. we ruled out ear infection. the pediatriciam looked into adjusting the dose for his reflux medication, and it has helped. tomorrow we go for blood work to check iron levels. today, we dropped down to one mid-day nap, and napped for almost two hours. i am still shook. it was glorious. his sleep last night was a little better after some tylenol before bed, so we will continue with that when he seems to be super fussy. again, thank you all for the support. here's to hoping things get better from here.

what is normal baby fussiness?	i'm a ftm mom of a 3mo old. i have recently introduced formula and breastfeed as well. i have been trying to understand what is normal baby fussiness? i feel helpless when the baby cries and i'm told that such reactions are okay. i cant give up the formula as my own supply is low. please let me know what is this 'normal baby fussiness?' and which formula worked best for your infant.	haileyFTM	/r/Mommit/comments/ob074j/what_is_normal_baby_fussiness/	8	7	0	1.0	1625068426.0

how do i find a way to return to work without becoming a sniveling pile of guilt and sadness?	i always thought i'd be one of those moms who would be ecstatic to return to work. i'm super extroverted and got a lot of fulfillment out of my job pre-baby. well, my first day back is in 10 days, and nothing could be further from the truth. possibly because i've been working from home for a year now, but the idea of returning to the world of adults has completely lost its appeal. instead, all i can think about is all the smiles, giggles, hugs and snuggles i'll be missing out on with my son. he'll be watched by my mom for the first 6 months, and i trust her completely, but.. it's not me. and i can't stop crying over it. because me staying home was never really the plan, so and i aren't really in a place financially where i could be home. we could make it work, but it would basically mean giving up on a lot of our lifetime goals, including possibly another child. but part of me thinks, this is the most important thing you'll ever do, isn't that worth giving up the big house with a yard and fancy vacations? i feel wracked with guilt that i won't be the one raising him, teaching him, and experiencing life with him for 80% of his waking hours. i want to be there for the meltdowns, the playdates, the same silly kids shows on repeat. it's impacting my ability to be there for my son right now, which is making me feel even worse. for those of you who have felt the same or similar, how did you handle this transition emotionally? anything you did to inspire you, or just plain cope? i asked my friend how she did it and even she said lots of crying 	thegutsymouse	/r/Mommit/comments/oboqal/how_do_i_find_a_way_to_return_to_work_without/	11	4	0	0.75	1625154894.0

i don't know what to do	its 3am and my 11 month old has been crying for 5 hours now. i have fed her. i have bathed her. i have let her cry. i have held her. i have done everything i can think of. she felt warm, so i took a rectal temp and it was 102.5. do i take her to the er? she was fine at bed time. cousins came over and she got a little over tired,but nothing crazy. &; edit thanks everyone. i gave her some more tylenol and she eventually fell asleep. her fever came down too 100.7. she woke up this morning like nothing happened, albeit a little later than normal. no fever, eating fine, and in a much better mood. i still will bring her in to get a check up, but it seems like whatever was wrong has passed.

breastfeeding advice for a newmom	im a new mom and i've been trying to successfully breastfeed my daughter. she was born on june 8th 2021 and i cant help but feel like a bad mom for not being able to have good nursing sessions with her. i resorted to giving her a bottle of my pumped milk but i desperately want to get her to breastfeed. everyone keeps saying it takes time to learn it but how long? its been 3 weeks almost 4 now and i still cant get her to latch properly. she isnt tongue tied and i've been to a lactation consultant her got her to latch easily. its just my fault because i cant get the positioning or technique right. i've watched so many videos on how to do it but i still cant seem to get it right. my nipples got so sore i got mastitis and its finally gone away but i want to prevent that from happening again. i dont want to keep feeling pain when she feeds from me but i want her to be able to eat. i just dont know what to do or how much longer it will take	TBHemotions	/r/Mommit/comments/ocit8y/breastfeeding_advice_for_a_newmom/	4	0	0	0.5	1625258044.0
what should i expect going forward?	my baby is almost 3 weeks old, and he was just circumcised today. hes always been a calm baby and only cries when hes wet or hungry, but im nervous about his healing process and what i can do to make things easier on him pain wise. i have tylenol for him but im nervous and dont know what to expect, any advice from moms whove been through this would be so helpful on another note, being present for the procedure was one of the hardest things ive been through, more painful than birth. seeing is little body strapped down and crying his lungs out until he was red made me feel so helpless and awful. im glad i wont have to do that again!!! edit wasnt aware this was such a touchy subject here. ive talked this over with my boyfriend and our pediatrician for so long and i do not regret my decision. im just asking advice, thats all.	aggravated-asphalt	/r/Mommit/comments/ockwow/what_should_i_expect_going_forward/	28	0	0	0.36	1625264322.0

what baby monitor setup do you use for 2 toddlers in separate rooms?	i have a 3 year old and almost 2 year old. up to this point they've shared a room. we have one monitor with a camera on each of their beds and we just switch between the video feeds as needed. if one wakes up or cries out it sets off the monitor no matter which camera it's on. we're in the process of buying a new home where they will each have their own room. also it's a two story house with the master bedroom upstairs and the kids down. thanks for the advice.

moms of babies and toddlers, how much do you sacrifice nap schedules and bedtime for social activities? how far do you drive out of your way to see friends?	i'm just curious to know where other parents stand as we emerge from this covid bubble. how far do you drive with your baby or toddler in tow to visit friends on a typical weekend? how late would you push a bedtime? how often do you skip naps to meet up with friends? almost all of our friends live an hour away and we are the first in our friend group to have kids. i'm trying to balance keeping my 9 month old happy and well-rested without being the mom who is overly rigid! for instance, today our friends are meeting up at a brewery 30 minutes away from our house at 7pm. our baby goes to bed no later than 8 00....do we even try to go?

really struggling with 3yo behaviour, could use some advice.	my 3yo has had a lot of changes in her life this year we brought home her baby sister in january, and shes been great about it. recently however, she moved into the preschool class at daycare and since then ive noticed her behaviour changing. the amount of meltdowns has increased to at least one or two huge meltdowns every day, and that doesnt include screaming herself to sleep for naptime. if she is even remotely tired, its like a switch flips and she becomes extremely defiant, says no to everything, starts hitting and throwing and it usually ends in a giant meltdown. i just dont know how to help her. i follow a lot of parenting accounts, i try to validate her feelings when this happens, tell her im here for her etc but it just seems to aggravate her even more. im exhausted and not going to lie, ive lost my patience more times than i care to admit. i find myself slamming doors and raising my voice even. ugh. has anyone been here and care to share how/when it got better? thx.

when does leaving the house with your kid get easier?	first time mom of a 3 month old here! we just got home from being at my in-laws for the day and what used to be nice/fun family gatherings, now feel like an olympic sport. my husband and i spent almost the entire time feeding the baby, getting her to nap, or getting her changed into or out of her swim suit. i feel exhausted. i honestly couldnt wait to get home and sit on the couch and just cuddle with my baby in peace. between packing all of the things, taking care of the babe away from home with the things you pack, and eventually packing it all back up to go home, leaving the house can feel so exhausting with a baby. my question to seasoned parents out there is when does it get easier to leave the house with your baby? i dont want to let life pass us by, but dang am i exhausted after every outing.	daylight-1	/r/Mommit/comments/odxfy7/when_does_leaving_the_house_with_your_kid_get/	124	176	0	0.99	1625449491.0
advice needed regarding a tough situation	hi all. im looking for opinions and input on my familys situation. ultimately i know well need to make this decision on our own but think of this as a what would you do situation. for starters - please be kind and do not say anything negative regarding my husband, he is doing what he can when he can. i am also not having a self pity party by making this post, just explaining the situation. my little guy is 8 weeks old and of course very needy. my husband has epilepsy and the lack of sleep from having a newborn has become a major trigger for his seizures and we are seeing a direct impact. he is having increased seizure activity as a result, bad for his health and unsafe fir him and baby. for that reason, he has stopped all overnight shifts, does not get up early with the baby anymore and naps when needed . he also cannot drive for the time being due to this. so that puts all of our familys driving needs and overnight shifts/early wake ups on me. to say i am exhausted is an understatement. without those switch offs and breaks i am struggling big time from an exhaustion perspective, let alone emotionally and mentally. the big question -do i enroll my son in daycare earlier than technically needed in order to create some balance and allow ample time for myself to recharge. he would minimally have to go 3 full days d week, as per their enrollment policies. he is already set to go full time in mid-august so i can go to work. i feel very guilty and like a weak mother for even considering this, as he is so young and im technically available. however, i dont think i can continue to function like this. the lack of consistent sleep alone is driving me crazy. in my situation, would you enroll him part time for now until he transitions to full time or stick it out? i ask because you all have experience with newborns and may have ideas as to whether this is sustainable to keep doing or if enrolling him so young will be a big deal. any experience with enrolling a very young infant in daycare is welcome!	roonerlover	/r/Mommit/comments/oe0u0p/advice_needed_regarding_a_tough_situation/	34	39	0	1.0	1625464138.0

i need help with post partum depression	hi guys i am 4 days post partum and i have had crying spells all day every day since i went into labor before even giving birth. after giving birth i was having a lot of stress and anxiety and not bonding with my baby the same way i did my first. since yesterday, ive been having waves of panic attacks for no apparent reason. i just start hyperventilating, feel like i cant breath, start shaking and feeling like im going to throw up. i cant sleep either. my daughter went to a friends house and my husband took the baby and said just sleep. and still i couldnt. its getting even worse now i have a constant stomach ache, constantly shaking and on the verge of crying but trying to keep it under control for my daughter. even the thought of food makes me nauseous. just the sun going down and knowing my husband and daughter are going to fall asleep soon and i will be awake alone all night is giving me all of these symptoms again. please, are there any coping mechanisms i can try or hotlines i can call? i physically cant go on handling all this on top of the other physical pains that come from giving birth snd breastfeeding. i feel so completely hopeless and scared. edit thank you everyone im seeing my dr today	KaraHurricane	/r/Mommit/comments/oemjc9/i_need_help_with_post_partum_depression/	7	3	0	1.0	1625541192.0

how many years are between your kids?	im 21 and my daughter is 9 months old. ive been thinking about planning for our next child a little after she turns a year old. i know they recommend at least 2 years before trying for another, but i want my babies to be close in age. my closest brother was 4 years older than me and my oldest brother was 6 years older than me. we never got along or really spent time together until we were adults. i also want to just be done with popping out kids early on so i can focus on experiencing life with them while im still young. i want at least one more, preferably 2 more, but my s/o doesnt want more than 2 kids. anyone have children around 21 months apart? or even less? im honestly willing to try right now but im not sure how open he is to that. i would love to hear about your experiences with pregnancy before 2 years postpartum. i had an all natural birth if that makes any difference. what are your pros and cons of having 2 under 2?

are there any single moms here? i need advice.. on everything.	i am 23. i got pregnant at 19 and had my baby girl at 20. i have no family here and all of my friends moved due to school or work. the baby's father is still around , gives child support but admittedly not a lot. the truth is that i should've aborted, because i just cannot give my baby the life she deserves. it breaks my heart every day. since nobody can take care of her for me so that i can work, i live on welfare , and i take care of her full time. weeks pass by without any breaks, and if her father does come, it's only for a few hours. i can't work, can't study, because how will i when i can't even take 2 hours for myself? i am so so lost. i don't want to give my baby up, i love her with all my heart. but i can't keep living like this anymore. i can't afford daycare. rent is $1500, daycare is $2000 a month, and i've been on a few waitlists for subsidized daycare for almost 2 years. around the time that i got pregnant, i helped a friend get a phone and a plan. they left with the phone, and i was left paying for two phones . they promised to pay for it monthly, but didn't. this ruined my credit. i wasn't able to pay for both. my credit is awful. i can't find any cheaper places to live, and the ones that do not require a credit check are awful, with landlords that don't care. currently, my apartment right now has a lot of issues. my landlord takes cash and did not require a credit check. also has no garbage bin. my landlord picks up the garbage once a week. i hate my life. edit there's also no laundry. i have to walk three blocks to do laundry. it's gotten to the point where i just don't do it. it costs $10. after rent i am always left with $150. that is mostly what i live on. i always thought i would be a good mom. i am a good mom. but i'm just so stressed out. i don't know what to do, it's like i am in prison. i'm depressed. i just want to die every day. but i love my baby so much. she's so beautiful. it tears me apart to know that she deserves so much better. she's a good girl. because of covid, and my friends not having any children or living nearby, my daughter has barely met anyone. she's almost 3 and still has trouble talking. she can count to ten, knows the basics of what i tell her, and tries her best to communicate, but it's just not enough because she has nobody else in her life. that's my fault, and i don't know what to do about anything. &; it's starting to seem like i'm just supposed to die. i can't give her up and keep living.. if i gave up custody or something, i would just have to kill myself because i love her so much. but i don't know how to live like this anymore. it's been almost 3 years of this. i'm starting to shut down. i don't know how to fix my life. i have no help. it just seems like the world is telling me to die. i don't deserve to be here because i'm so useless. i just can't anymore. how? how did any of you do it? i'm hanging on by a thread.	constantlylosthelp	/r/Mommit/comments/ofc85u/are_there_any_single_moms_here_i_need_advice_on/	10	10	0	1.0	1625634274.0

my daughter storms off and sulks when told not do to something - what's my next step?	my daughter will be 4 in august. she's a great kid, generally very kind and smart, but of course she does plenty of things she shouldn't do as well. we try our best to be respectful to her, but of course we also want to set boundaries for appropriate behavior. when she's told not to do something , she storms off and sulks, eventually she comes back and it's usually as if nothing happened and she'll get back into whatever she wants to do. i generally ignore this behavior, but sometimes she'll say things like you really upset me, you yelled at me etc, basically posing herself as the injured party, which is where i'm stuck. i don't go off the handle at her, but i will raise my voice if she's doing something potentially dangerous , but i do want to appreciate that she doesn't want to be yelled at. my worry is that she'll internalize this as me victimizing her instead of as her doing something wrong that she should stop doing. where i'm stuck is, it doesn't feel right to just let her get away with everything, and it's not as if we can do the natural consequence of you sitting on your brothers head is that you hurt your brother, and i'm not sure if ignoring the sulking is the right call either. should i go after her and try to talk about it? is there a better way to even address the things she's doing in the first place?	penelbell	/r/Mommit/comments/ofo6yy/my_daughter_storms_off_and_sulks_when_told_not_do/	7	1	0	1.0	1625680322.0
advice for baby who hates strollers	hi mommit!! my little guy is 9 months and totally hates sitting up in the stroller. as a baby in these pandemic times, we didnt get a lot of opportunity to stroll around. in the beginning, we used a stroller for a bit with the infant car seat attachment. now he is bigger and we are going out more, we tried having him sit up more in the stroller. every time he is put in, he just wails and hates it. any ideas or advice? anyone else go through this? fellow pandemic parents? so far we have tried all types of toys but no go. my arms are just not strong enough to just carry him around all day!	toozenforthis	/r/Mommit/comments/ofsw13/advice_for_baby_who_hates_strollers/	2	1	0	1.0	1625694394.0

how to vet a sitter who is your neighbor?	so our house abuts five houses. two of those have fences so we dont really talk to those neighbors often. well, the nieghbor got a puppy and i petted her through the fence. the boy who lived there started talking to me, very polite. id met him in passing at a neighborhood block party years prior where he was the nicest kid to my son who was 3 or 4 at the time. he basically looked after him and helped him play with the other kids since my son was on the younger side of the kids playing. anywho, he offered to babysit my boys who are now 3 and 6. my question is, do i have to get references from him? i only have spoken to his parents once or twice in passing. does he know cpr? has he had courses? how do i feel better about this without grilling him? also, i would love to find a good role model for my boys in the neighborhood and im just hoping this kid would be that which is why i want to make this work.

what would be a fair schedule?	my husband works and i'm a sahm for our 3month old. i was gonna go back to work on the weekends but my job wasn't going to accommodate me, so i resigned, but that's another story. i run the household by cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, budgeting and paying the bills. pretty much making sure we make it by on just his income. my husband works monday through friday from 5am and doesn't get off until the work is finished. sometimes that is 1pm and sometimes its 8pm. i am trying to figure out what would be fair to my husband to watch our daughter so i can get a little breather. i don't want to go anywhere, i just want to be able to eat a meal in peace and watch a little tv or play a video game without constantly having to press pause. i've told my husband that even when he is watching her, i don't truly get a break because i have to pump so our daughter has food and i catch up laundry and take care of our animals. i also feel bad because i used to work at the same job 2 years ago and i know its a super manual job and i know he's tired when he gets home and doesn't wanna go straight to baby duty everyday. any suggestions? we don't have child care or anyone nearby that could babysit. it's just he, our daughter and i.

need help sick 1 year old	we are both suffering i havent slept my son is congested and ive used nose frida and prescribed saline drops and steamed rooms and have a cool mist humidifier, ive tried vicks zarbees. he wont breathe through his nose which in turn stops him from breastfeeding. this started yesterday this is going on day two im losing my mind my breast hurt and i have an equally frustrated baby. i dont know what else to do. as i type he is whining in my arms. update! thank you everyone! i did take him to the er they gave him some saline drops and tried sucking some of the mucus out. as he is a 1 year old i was cleared to give him honey which helped a lot! i also stored and pumped breastmilk the past few days as advised by the awesome mamas here and since he was struggling with nursing i learned that he really loves scrambled eggs so hes been eating eggs and small finger foods with juice boxes. ive been using the nose frida to suction out everything so that it keeps his passage ways clear. i also gave him an herb bath a bath with dried eucalyptus rosamary and lavender i first ran the bath really hot with the herbs inside of the water and trapped the heat in the bathroom so it could steam up. once that happened i sat with him in the steamed bathroom room and then once the water was cooled down i put him inside of the tub and everything poured out of him his nose was like a faucet he left completely cleared. he is still sick but no where near as when i made this post! colds suck! and i just want to thank you guys so much!

when does it get easier?	my son is 11 weeks old tomorrow and i feel like im starting to hit a wall in terms of endurance. my grandma who actually adopted me at birth died when he was 2 weeks so ive been dealing with grief in addition to hormonal bullshit and sleep deprivation. im already seeing a therapist and am in group therapy and have an appointment with a psychiatrist so that i can request to go back on zoloft, which i had weaned off of when i was pregnant. i do love my son, more than i ever imagined i could love someone, which actually makes me feel worse. i put so much pressure on myself to keep him happy and safe. hes always had a really whiny temperament which ive had to try not to take personally, like hes mad at me or im doing something wrong. the sleep issues are probably the worst though. im obsessed with sleep - his sleep and my own. i try to adhere to safe sleep guidelines and do 99% of the time. he sleeps in his bassinet, no blankets or toys etc, on his back. but there have been days or sometimes weeks that he will only sleep in mine or my husbands arms, in which case wed take shifts holding him. his latest thing is waking up every hour past 5 am, which is my shift. i was so tired this am that i brought him into our bed. i know there are safer ways to cosleep but i didnt do any of them - i just put him right between my husband and i on our soft memory foam mattress . i made that decision out of exhaustion, and now that im awake i feel guilty and like i cant trust myself to do the safest thing for him all the time, and for what that could mean in the future. my husband just doesnt get it. my mom was a drug addict for 20 years while her kids were growing up so i cant really talk to her about all of this . my sister has a kid but shes so busy that we barely get to talk, and all she says is that she hated the newborn stage. i find myself pulling away from the women in my postpartum therapy group, finding excuses not to like them, i think just because im so miserable. when does this get better?	illeshamarie	/r/Mommit/comments/oh40ug/when_does_it_get_easier/	25	12	0	1.0	1625862690.0
advise needed 7mo baby too distracted to drink milk now. rather climb and crawl instead and takes an hour to drink 180ml/6oz. how should new feed schedule be like?	hi parents, can you tell us what to do in this situation? before baby was younger, feeding her was somewhat easier so half hour for milk and done. now at each feed she takes half hour to crawl and climb the pillows and then half hour to drink the bottle but she's so tired from exploring she can't finish the bottle and sleeps instead. all this is done in a dark room to minimize distraction already. the daily recommended milk i saw is 16-24 oz and she's barely meeting the 16oz now. is that okay? pediatrician says her weight is fine and she can afford to not finish bottle once awhile and if she's hungry from skipping she'll make it up next feed? she's also taking 6oz of puree solids a day. what's the best option to help her with finishing her milk properly now? what's her new feeding schedule should be? thanks for your help.	mused8	/r/Mommit/comments/ohk5ox/advise_needed_7mo_baby_too_distracted_to_drink/	10	1	0	1.0	1625928893.0
how do you get 4 year olds to clean up?	genuinely seeking advice. daughter is in lala land but 4 year olds have more empathy than younger littles. tried making checklists, pictures, demonstrating, responsibility charts, making it the clean up game and more. perhaps im expecting too much of her cognitively? ive been nagging her this weekend, and its undermining progress. shes also been whining a lot. one major cause overly permissive parenting by.me. so ive trying to let her cry it out a few minutes, and eventually we get a hug in and make progress if she asks very nicely. first this then that.isnt working so well. baby on the way in jan. partly wanted her to have the gift of siblings and so we didnt spoil her too much. darn kids are pretty cute at times so its hard to say no. and im mad and laughing inside and with you at her latest angry insults for not getting her way whining. mama, you have to go live on the roof of the car. you arent giving me what i want. no more cuddles for you mommy! i wont hug you any more! all advice welcome.

 advice needed should i risk a potentially week long vacation with an infant?	wanting to hear some honest thoughts from other parents and/or tips on how to survive potentially a week at a cottage in august my husbands parents are paying for us to have our own 2 bedroom cottage in a row of other cottages so we are all near each other. its a tradition his familys done for years since he was small but now that we have our babe - she will be 4 months old when we go, im having lots of anxiety thinking about going. basically heres a list of the factors that im unsure of no ac in cottage so it does get cool in the night the no sunscreen rule in infants until 6+ months of age bugs!? theres obviously mosquitoes up there and black flies as well. do they have baby bug spray or do i buy mesh screens? the drive up is 5 hours! she does not enjoy car rides for the most part she whines and has lost her mind crying before - we could potentially leave in the early morning when its still dark out and head up but then i worry about deer on the highway his family will spend the majority of their days on the boat, which we wouldnt be participating in. they have offered to watch her while i get opportunities to fish, but she is very attached to me as i do the majority of her care so it wont be a relaxing vacation for me knowing my luck, itll be right in the middle of her 4 month sleep regression lol! i have suggested to my husband that he goes and enjoys a week up there and i stay home with the baby - i want him to be able to enjoy his holidays and that way the cottage doesnt go totally unused as its probably too late for his parents to get their deposit back. he was undecided as he knows hell miss her and also really wants her to join the family traditions. okay everyone, give me your honest feedback to help me make a decision to go or not. if anyone has had any experience going on holidays with an infant let me know how it went!

how to manage new life	i hope i can make this short. my husband and i have been together for 12 years and 6 years married. we have obviously had our fun with being together just the two of us. well, last year we unexpectedly got pregnant and had our baby this past january. we also purchased a home last august. obviously the pandemic has tested a lot of relationships but i feel like ours wasnt bad until recently. weve been arguing a lot lately and its always the same thing. he feels i dont provide for him intimately but i am literally drained from day to day with baby apart from other things that we have to do around the house. i also work from home. the deal was, he takes basically grave yard shift at work and i work 9am -6pm. i watch the baby at night and tend to her needs as they come starting from 7 30 pm until 9 am the next day, for obvious reasons that he needs to sleep and go to work. he was supposed to watch her from 9am until i finish work but it never happened. i always ended up missing work hours because he needed breaks from her. it got to the point where i was basically watching her more often so she is now in day care. this gives him time to nap if he needs to . so i watch her most of the night and get up with her if needed, then i get her ready for day care and we pick her up at 3 so that he can still have time with her. but obviously a house comes with daily chores and things to get ready. making sure the dog is fed, dishwasher is cleared and filled up again, cleaning here and there, food etc. i was doing that behind the scenes so when he asked me why i couldnt make time for him, i basically wrote down my daily schedule and showed him. and i told him if he could find space in my head where i could fit him in, that would be great. he realized i do a lot and created a check list for himself so that he can help around the house . now, the problem is this. because he now has a checklist, he thinks that after a few weeks of helping around the house i should have enough mental space for him. and while i do want to create this space for him, i am still exhausted from waking up at night and dealing with things. i feel that he doesnt see how much i went through carrying our child. while she is the greatest thing ever and i love her, i was not in a state where i was ready to have a kid- mostly because i knew the responsibility that would fall on me for having a kid. even though he helps with things, the baby is a mental and emotional load 24/7 and some days i am so over touched and i feel like i have sensory overload. the last thing i want to do is feel like i have to provide for the needs of someone else and i barely have time to provide for my needs. we have talked therapy, and although he hesitates is willing to do it. though he says it feels like an ultimatum from me. but he doesnt get how much it sucks to feel like i owe him some time for helping around the house- the house he agreed to pay for with me and the house he lives in too. idk, i guess i just want to know if anyone has dealt with something similar. i know parenthood comes with new obstacles and learning new ways to be a team but i really dont know what else to do at this point. if you made it this far, thank you for hearing me out.

how to make peace with current baby being your last?	i have a 2 year old and an 8 month old. i had preeclampsia during both my pregnancies, 1 ended in an emergency c section and an awful hospital stay with lots of magnesium. i know i would get preeclampsia again if i were to ever get pregnant, it seems like my body just does not agree with pregnancy. the thought of having a 3rd c section also makes me squeamish. i keep telling myself and others that there is no way in hell i would ever have another baby and that i dont want another, but the truth is i do. i just know it cant happen and it will not happen, and that makes me so sad. i feel like i blinked and all of a sudden my youngest is 8 months old. wasnt she just born yesterday? why is she starting to crawl and cutting teeth and eating solids now? where did the time go? thinking about not getting another chance to swaddle a tiny newborn or experience things like the first latch, skin to skin, their going home from the hospital outfit, or those little newborn coos...it breaks my heart. so how do i deal? is it something you can ever make peace with? i know its whats best for my family and i, but that doesnt make it any easier.	sparkleblarkle	/r/Mommit/comments/oioejr/how_to_make_peace_with_current_baby_being_your/	11	9	0	0.85	1626084994.0

why is it so hard to have friends?	my days are full to the max. i don't have to go into detail because you mommas know. between my full time job, daycare drop off's and pick up's, cooking dinners, toddler baths, laundry, showers, and whatever else needs doing, i don't have time. i don't have time to read. i don't have time to work out. i don't have time to do anything extra. my house is in a constant state of chaos. before having my lo, i had 3 very close friends. one has moved several states away. one lives about 40 mins away, and now also has 2 kids. one straight ghosted me. this is all fine and well. i am usually able to sweet talk dh into giving me a few hours after work a couple of times a month to go have a drink or two. sometimes i go alone. sometimes i go with a work friend, but it's not really the same as having a bff. i have accepted my fate in that sense. however, over the weekend, dh and i packed up lo to go to a really cool brewery that is in a neighborhood that we are getting ready to move to in a few months. he had 2 friends call him back to back asking him if he wanted to meet up to hang out. it made me really sad for a few minutes. i have no friends. my life is entirely made up of being a mom, a wife and an employee. i try my very best to really enjoy the moments i have with my 2 year old, knowing that one day he won't want to snuggle or follow me every time i move from room to room. but dammit i wish i had friends call me to hang out. update to say thank you for all of your kind and understanding responses. i have signed up for one of those drink and paint classes this coming monday. maybe i can make a friend there!!

what can i do with a baby that will get me out of the house for a while?	after this past year, i am so fed up. i love my husband and my daughter but ever since march of last year all we have done is sit in this stupid house all day long. i am an extrovert and my mental health has absolutely plummeted. my husband is a gamer and has no issue gaming all day long. i have been putting a lot of pressure on him to hang out with me and do things with me at least a couple times a month. i dont have any friends and my family lives 5 hours away. i dont have anything that makes me happy. the only things i like to do is just not be home. i go to dance classes once a week but its just not enough. i work from home too. i have come to the conclusion that i need to get tf out of this house. however, i am ebf and cant go anywhere for long without the baby because she needs to eat. so in order for me to be able to be gone all day, i need to bring her with. but i need some help finding something to do with her. what have you guys done if youre feeling this way? where do you go? what do you do?

on the struggle bus. 	3 days postpartum. what an absolute blessing becoming a mom has been. i still cant believe little guy is here. hes a milk monster basically. hes been cluster feeding at night basically every night hes been earth side. i dont mind too much, but what im struggling with is he will not sleep anywhere accept on top of me. during the day he naps with dad or in his dock a tot just fine. but at night nope- has to be skin to skin. i love it so much bc who wouldnt love constant snuggles but i also would like to sleep. sleep is good and it seems everyone is getting it except for me. any tips/tricks on getting him to sleep in his bassinet- its right next to me ive swaddled him up and hes good for like 10 mins then starts getting fussy. i assumed it was because he doesnt like his arms contained- should i try an arms up swaddle? ftm - kinda clueless and just going with the flow.	snallen_182	/r/Mommit/comments/ok37q9/on_the_struggle_bus_3d_pp/	7	2	0	0.67	1626265353.0
need some advice on teething	my little one is 13 months old and has been having a rough go with teething pain. so much so that we took him to the doctor just to make sure nothing else was wrong. they checked him out and thankfully hes healthy. the pediatrician says that four molars are erupting all at once and he has an eruption cyst. she estimated it would be a month or so before all four break through completely. i dont know if i can make it. hes miserable at night. the night before last he was up four times. last night he refused to sleep between 12 and 3am. im exhausted. he doesnt want any of the teething rings, no wash cloth, no ice pop. ive been giving him ibuprofen as directed by the pediatrician. everything ive read online says teething pain only lasts a few days. this has been going on for nearly a month and has gotten progressively worse. any tips/advice?

how would you react baby on atv	ok, so long story short my mom is my childcare for my 10 month old. weve had some power struggles, not gonna lie, but this is the situation for us right now. today when i picked my baby up, i said wow your cheeks are really red, have you been out in the sun today?? my mom and dad like to take my baby to the garden, so i assumed thats what it was. then my mom says, umm, she might have been on the four wheeler today. i was honestly shocked and didnt know how to respond. i was like, wait, are you serious? was she seriously on a four wheeler? and my mom said she was. she rode with my dad. i know my parents wouldnt do anything crazy, and im sure my dad was going super slow, and it was probably just a minute or two, but how would you react? i am super nit picky about car seat safety so this just seems so wrong to me. please be nice in your response and dont mom shame me. i will do the best for my daughter. i am just worried about my mom undermining me and not even asking before doing something like that!	anonomom20	/r/Mommit/comments/okgscx/how_would_you_react_baby_on_atv/	27	48	0	0.98	1626306517.0

suggestions- maternity leave activism at work	my company does not provide any maternity leave . what they do provide, is unpaid fmla which as anyone in thee us knows is complete bs. in order to use this unpaid 12 weeks of fmla, you must first use all of your built up pto, which again, is complete bs. i want to draft an email to my corporate office/ benefits office to complain about this and push for company policy to be adjusted to at least have something for maternity leave. the problem is i of course want to be taken seriously, and not just end up with a rant. what things would you all include like requests and reasons for implementation? my thought is to start small asking for 6 weeks paid . would additional leave at half/partial pay be too much to ask for straight away? i am oad so none of this will affect me in the long run, but if my state hadn't just implemented paid fmla i would have only had roughly 40 days paid and no remaining time off. thanks for any help and ideas.

how do you make friends?	when i was pregnant i imagined getting to take my baby to museums, playgrounds, mommy & me activities, and so on. i figured it would be great to share so much with the babe and that i was bound to meet some potential friends at one of those places. then covid came along and none of that was an option for safety sake. im cooped up, lonely, and need adult time beyond my spouse, but im still playing it safe with covid. are there any online groups i could check out or places to look forward to sometime in the future when we can live normally again? tldr; gaming mom looking for friends.	purplekittybutt	/r/Mommit/comments/olsrkk/how_do_you_make_friends/	15	9	0	1.0	1626478253.0
anyone else feel crushing mom guilt when their toddler watches tv?	my daughter is nearly two years old and i'll be painfully honest, the tv in our house is on almost all day. she's our only child right now and while i love her to bits, i just don't have the mental fortitude to play with her and entertain her the whole time she's awake. i do try to make sure that she gets a variety of stimulation throughout the day but those things just don't seem to fill up much time. so then i turn mickey mouse clubhouse back on and she watches that while i get stuff done. the guilt just eats me alive. i scroll through social media and see so many moms who look like they are doing so much better than me, and i read so many comments that detail how horrible television is to little kids, especially under the age of two, and how you should never ever let them watch anything or play with your phone, or interact with screens at all. i guess i'm maybe looking for ideas of other things to do to fill the time so i don't fall back on tv so much? or maybe i just want to hear that i'm not alone. i feel like such a terrible mom and that everyone else is doing so much better. &; edit thank you all so much for your comments! it is so so so wonderful to see that i am not alone! motherhood can just be so isolating and living so far away from my friends and family, sometimes it feels like my only connection to the outside world is through social media. logically, i understand that people's lives look a lot different than what they are posting, but it's still so hard when all you see is highlight reel after highlight reel. after reading through these comments, i've realized that i need to focus more on what is actually in front of me, and less about all these hypothetical things in my head. my daughter is happy and energetic and developing normally. she has good days and bad days but is all-around, a normal little toddler! she's doing well, and it's okay if i take some time to make sure i'm doing well also. i will work on letting go of my guilt! thank you all so much <3	tors87	/r/Mommit/comments/olvp0q/anyone_else_feel_crushing_mom_guilt_when_their/	33	43	0	0.99	1626489290.0
i got hurt yesterday and i am really struggling with basically being useless right now.	warning glass and blood so, i feel so dumb. we had just bought these large glass bowls, the only place to store them was on top of the fridge. they were pretty secure. well i guess not. i closed the fridge door and down they came. they hit the counter first and then the ground. it was loud. and jarring and scary. then i noticed a piece of glass sticking out of my ankle. not a giant piece but not small. my kids are freaking out. my husband is freaking out and im just trying to stay standing because i went into shock. i think i tried to sit down, in the glass so i didnt fall. by the time my husband cleared a path to me, the blood was dripping off the glass. thankfully it wasnt that deep. main concerns were keeping me from passing and cleaning up the glass. im really struggling to walk. its not swollen, its not bruised. i can move it and wiggle my toes and none of that hurts, but walking does. thankfully my husband was able to go into work late to help me with the kiddos bedtime. but it was really rough when he left and they thought it meant play time. my oldest, bless him was like no no no, its bed time. go to bed! to his little brother who kept getting out of bed. he also kept saying goodnight, i love you! to me every time his brother got out and he was closing the door behind them. its not much better today. walking hurts. im calling the nurse advise line later today. my husband needs to get some sleep if hes going to be helping me to the hospital if i have to go or dealing with the kids. i hate this. im used to migraines putting me down for the count and still working through them if i absolutely have to, but its never been something this physical before and i am just mad. i hate this.	littleredteacupwolf	/r/Mommit/comments/om38a9/i_got_hurt_yesterday_and_i_am_really_struggling/	6	1	0	0.6	1626524572.0

i don't want my child going to her friend's house for the shittiest reason.	my 4yo recently had a birthday party at a friend's house. her friend has an autistic older brother who understandably runs his parents ragged. i totally get how everyone does the best they can with what they've got, and i have nothing but kindness in my heart. but honest to god - i don't want my child going over to her friend's house again because it's filthy. there's hair everywhere but there's no pet. there's faeces up the walls, in the toys. there's old food around the house. i didn't even want to look at the things growing out of the walls. and i'm torn. my daughter's friend is not at all at fault with all this. and understandably she would like my daughter over for a playdate at some point. but now that i've seen the house - i just can't. my husband says it's a matter of redirecting the conversation - yes, let's have a playdate, would you rather go to the zoo or the park? - and i already know the mum is stretched to the max as it is, which is why she's always suggesting parks instead. i'm guessing that her plans to clean the house fell through for whatever reason, because she was clearly flustered and embarrassed when we arrived and excused herself by making me hang up the decorations so that she could tidy what she could further. but i know my daughter. she's direct, and appreciates it when i'm direct. so what do i say to her when she notices that we don't go to her friend's house anymore? or i keep redirecting to other activities and locations? note that doesn't change my attitudes towards the family whatsoever. please be kind - all i want to know is what to say to my bright little girl when she notices.	jazinthapiper	/r/Mommit/comments/omnh3t/i_dont_want_my_child_going_to_her_friends_house/	90	258	0	0.97	1626601191.0

why do moms get sad without their kids on free time while dads dont?	i notice that when we go out for a girls dinner after not seeing eachother for months, the moms will immediately want to go back home to their baby after a couple hours. on day trips or weekend getaways with the girls, the mom gets homesick and cried because its their first time away from the baby. they will keep checking for photos and face time opportunities. yet with men, it seems like once they are out, they dont think about the baby. they enjoy their free time and not stress about having to make it back to say goodnight to their baby. i am not a mom so i would like to try to understand. i will be trying for a baby in a few months lol.

its none of your business how i treat my grandchild! - rant	 . i was told something similar to the title by my dad. but lets start differently my dad annoyed me for almost a decade cause he wanted to be a grandpa before he dies . than i got pregnant and he was over the moon. he cried happy tears when we told them. he often tells me how proud he is and he cant wait to see his grandson again . he often calls to get some updates. all in all it would be perfekt sadly it isnt. my little one was not even 2 months old when i had to defend him against my father for the first time. we stayed at my parents place over night, my baby had his usual wake up, cry , eat, sleep rhythm. next morning my dad told my he wasnt able to fall asleep till 5am. i asked him if we have been to loud, he told me that he never heard us, so its not our fault. later i asked him to watch my little one for a while, so i could do some stuff with my mom, my dad agreed. but when i came to check on them, he was scolding my son for keeping him awake. i interrupted him why are you scolding him? you said it wasnt our fault! - he its none of your business how i talk with him. - me he is my son! so it is my business. especially when he gets scolded for something that isnt even his fault! - my dad tried some stupid excuses, but i hope he got the point for now. i know it sounds stupid. a baby that young doesnt care about being scolded. but i know my dad and i know i have to stop such a behavior before it starts. sadly it was just the first out of many conversations in which i have to explain him stuff that should be common sense. a few days ago we were talking on the phone. he asked about his grandson and so i told him he is doing good. just a bit belly pain every now and than, but nothing to worry.. first he told me that i shouldnt be scared to call a doctor when my little one is in pain, allegedly he did it a lot of times when we were his age. i already was like wtf?!. i explained to him that times have changed. nowadays you dont call the doc cause of some little belly pain. he wouldnt believe me. well, whatever. than when we were about to say goodbye, he said tell baby to be nice or else i will spank his butt - me angry no you wont do that! - he noticed how quick i got mad and tried to play it off as a joke ok, than just a little butt slap - me no, not even that! - he not even that? ohhh thats boring.. we said our good bye and hung up pretty quick. it really made me mad. when i grew up, i regularly got beaten up, even for minor things. when i was 5/6 years old, there was a new law, it stated that children have the right to physical integrity. but do you think my parents cared about it? nope. my dad kept beating us and my mom just looked away. till one day, when dad was beating us up in public, suddenly an old gentleman approached my parents with the words its forbidden by law to hit children! if you dont stop immediately, i will call the cops!! . dad stopped beating us in public after this incident and also reduced it at home the older we got. it just makes me so mad and sad. i already worry about the future. i already ask myself if i could leave my little one with my parents for a weekend when he is older. how should i trust my dad that he wont hurt my boy? should i risk it? would i be able to forgive myself when my dads hand slips? i know what mental damage it did to me. i dont want my child to go through the same. at least i know that i will never hurt my child on purpose. we already had one little incident where my baby got hurt while playing. he screamed for about a minute, after 5 minutes he already smiled again. i cried for the next hours and i still feel horrible and cant forgive myself for hurting him, even tho it was just a fucking accident. for those who made it till the end thank you for your time.

so how do i do playground outings with my toddler? is it weird for me to be on the playground? how can i help lo learn how to play with other kids?	i've begun taking my toddler to playgrounds, and i'm not sure what i, as the mom, should and should not be doing. lo is walking, but isn't talking yet. most of the time, the other kids at the playground are at least 3 years old, usually older. with my lo being so much smaller & younger than most kids on the playground, i usually follow closely behind lo and will help with navigating stairs and slides and such. i sometimes feel a little awkward being an adult on the playground like i might be putting a damper on the other kids' play time. is it weird for me to be on the play equipment? most of the adults i see on the playground are sitting on the sidelines supervising. should i wait to bring my lo to the playground until i know i won't need to assist lo with maneuvering? also, my lo doesn't interact with the other kids much. thanks to covid, these playground visits are our first opportunities to be around children. the most interaction lo initiates is walking up to some kids, standing there and staring at them, and after a while i'll usually encourage lo to take an interest in something else. how can i help lo learn to actually play with other kids? and what should i do when lo is standing and staring at kids? right now, i usually just wait to see if lo will interact. after a minute or two, i'll say hi or i'll tell the kids that lo doesn't talk yet, and it just feels awkward. the kids don't know what to say or do, and i don't really know what else to say or do, so it usually ends up with me ushering lo away to go play in some other part of the playground. how can i make these encounters more positive?

angry at sister-in-law for not showing up to daughters first birthday, help me be a better person	my boyfriend does not have a good relationship with his sister. she is very demanding when things do not go as she thinks they should she gets stressed and unpleasant. this happens so often that i think it is pathological. she is not really aware or at least mindful of the feelings of people around her. it is hard to like her or be around her. she is his only sister though and since i am an only child she is the only real aunt my daughter has. i come from a very warm family every birthday or other occasion the whole family came together to celebrate. i want my daughter to experience that kind of connection and sense of belonging too. so when my daughter turned 1 recently, we organised a small party. due to covid we only asked the grandparents and my sister-in-law and her partner . we asked way in advance. at first they said they were not sure they would make it because they would be moving around that time. after a few weeks we asked whether they knew anything and they had forgotten. my boyfriend let them know they were still more than welcome. fast forward another few weeks and their moving date was a week before the party, so i thought they would come. they did not show, however, nor mention it nor sent a card or something. when we shared some pictures of the day with the grandparents in the family whatsapp group they wished our daughter a happy birthday but that was it. and i just cannot let it go. i am so angry. a friend gave me some good advice if no one really appreciates her presence, we should not ask her. it is not fair to her either. we will not ask her again. but how do i get rid of this feeling of resentment? knowing her i am not sure that talking out out will help.

how to get kids who eat a lot to eat healthy without going broke??	hey everyone. i have 3 boys. my older two are 6 and 4 and they eat so much food in a day. from what i hear about teenage boys its only going to get worse. my kids already snack all day and then eat full meals. theyre so skinny and just so active and growing that they need tons of food. my 6 year old once ate an entire frozen pizza. my issue is that right now we end up buying a lot of chips/crackers/granola bars and typical kid snacks. we buy fruit, but they mostly like berries and bananas. bananas are cheap so i buy 3 bunches of them per week, but berries are expensive. we buy several of the big cartons from costco but we always run out before the end of the week. theyll eat cashews so we give them nuts sometimes too. does anyone have ideas on what we could buy thats healthy but also large quantities? i want them to develop healthy habits, but they eat so much i dont know how to afford it or what we can realistically buy in bulk thats healthy. cant even imagine what my grocery bill will end up being in the future.	katietargaryen	/r/Mommit/comments/oof0yj/how_to_get_kids_who_eat_a_lot_to_eat_healthy/	33	14	0	1.0	1626827827.0

have any boy moms had this problem before? what was it?	hoping for veteran boy moms to answer my question. so my baby is 6.5 months old. his urinary meatus keeps fluctuating between blood red and swollen, to pink, and to normal baseline. and idk if this is normal or not, but if his hands arent on a toy or holding himself up then they are scratching his crotch area or trying to grab at it. even keeping his nails filed daily he still manages to give himself bad scratches on his inner thighs and crotch area. is this normal for this age or is he trying to communicate a problem? back to the main problem. when it gets pink or red i put vaseline on it and change his diaper more frequently and after a few days of that itll improve but no matter what i do it keeps going back red. we saw a doctor about this like 6 weeks ago and they originally said its just diaper rash, just by eyeballing it. im worried its an infection or something that isnt fully resolving. or is it just recurrent diaper rash? no other part of his anatomy is changing color so i dont think its an allergy to the diaper. please help if you know what this is! google isnt very helpful here.	geek-parenting	/r/Mommit/comments/oog6hb/have_any_boy_moms_had_this_problem_before_what/	19	6	0	0.88	1626831967.0
how to handle crying mother?	my mom began crying this morning because she didnt want to go to work. im an adult and still live with her. i was also getting ready to go to work this morning. both of us get up around 4 am to get ready for work because i have to be at work by 6 am and i live 30 minutes away. her job is an hour away from where we live and she leaves later than me because she doesnt have to be there until 7 am. anyway she starts complaining about being tired and not wanting to go to work. im slightly irritated because she always does this. i understand shes tired but so am i. im not crying or getting upset. so she sits at the table and starts crying. its awkward for me because i dont say anything. maybe im being harsh but she just started working her current job after quitting her last job for the same reason. there needs to be a point where she has to accept that work isnt going to be fun and its awful to wake up early in the morning. maybe people suggest she quit and find another job. last time she quit without having a job lined up and left us barely able to pay rent. then complained the entire time she was home that she was bored and ready to work. that lasted for a month and now shes back wanting to quit. i cant rely on her at all to be consistent with her actions. thats why im trying to graduate and move out on my own. living with someone who cant hold a steady job is stressful. idk everyday with her is different. one day she promises to change then the next shes calling another company about an interview meaning shes fed up with her current job and is ready to quit. shell never be satisfied and seems to care less about how her actions affect other people.

one of the reasons why my house looks like a trash can	this morning, coffee in hand, i was determined to hone my time management skills and get the house tidy. sure im home alone for 10-11 hrs per day with three kids 8, 7 and 2 during summer but that wont stop me! well i just had to share a prime example- im dead laughing about it now. my 2 year old is getting potty trained and hid behind the door and pooped his pants. ready to patiently handle the situation, i helped him to the bathroom and took off the pants to discover since he was commando the huge avalanche of shit on his legs. he bolts out of the bathroom running around the house laughing hysterically while i chase him. the dog joins in this fun game and the house is getting its fair share of poo. i finally catch him, wrestle him into the shower while he screams his head off, hose out the pants, wash the door that was finger painted in poop and wipe down the rest of the house. 1 hour has passed and the 8 year old wants to play cards. so i decided to continue to live in a trash can but might as well have fun playing cards in it. bright side is i dont suck at time management this is just real life! okay now time to go clean up the board games 2 has discovered and dumped out. happy summer mamas!

first time mom, in need of sleep training advice	i've realized that now is about the time to start sleep training. problem is my son is the worst to put to sleep. i know i haven't exactly been doing every thing by the book which has just made it harder for myself so far. but here's the main issue. my son has become accustomed to falling asleep by breastfeeding. even if he's full he will want to eat to fall asleep. it's to the point where i have to put him down for naps and even sleep with him basically attached to my nipple. i know sleeping with your baby is a big no no. that's not the advice i'm looking for. sometimes he falls into a deep enough sleep for me to move away. sometimes he's attached to me almost all night or wakes up and rolls to me to reattach. i've tried rocking him to sleep and it works sometimes but most of the time he will fight it until he is able to sleep feed. i've tried giving him the pacifier instead of my nipple but he already has no interest in it to begin with so giving it to him when he is tired just makes him more fussy. does anyone have any tips or advice on sleep training? i want to get him into his own bed and get him to self soothe.	purplefloop	/r/Mommit/comments/opb8uh/first_time_mom_in_need_of_sleep_training_advice/	15	0	0	0.5	1626950241.0
why can't people just say hi back to toddlers?	it makes me so sad. my son is 15 months old and he loves to greet people as he walks by. he will always smile, wave and say hiya! and it breaks my heart how often people just flat out ignore him. we stopped at the drugstore on the way home from daycare the other day, he was so proud and excited while he carried around his sunscreen. he kept trying to show people that walked past by holding it up and exclaiming in gibberish to them. so many people ignored him, i felt just awful for him. by the time we were checking out he had totally given up and just wanted me to hold him. i was so thankful for the cashier because she actually spoke to him and he was soooo happy to show her his special purchase. it just bums me out, i wish more people would take two seconds to say hi back, or at least smile. update some interesting perspectives here! i suppose in this day and age people could be weary of speaking to an unfamiliar child. i'm not expecting people to have a full-blown conversation with a kid that can't speak yet, i was just a little disheartened that more people don't give a quick smile in passing. i grew up in a small town where everybody says hello so maybe i just need to get used to the city where people keep to themselves more.

how to end night feedings? 7mo	by boy is 7,5 months old and has been breast fed since birth. in the past month his night feedings increased from 1 to 3 feeding at least and it is bothering me. there are a few things to mention - we have started on solids since 5,5m - he is teething, with his second tooth cutting through now - its been hot at night a few weeks back, so i think he might have woken up multiple times because of that. - we are teaching him to sit and crawl, which he hasnt mastered just yet, but already wants to walk on his own. - it has been harder in general during the day, but especially at night, to the point where we had to start co-sleeping again, because he would just wake up screaming at night and the only way to calm him would be feeding. speaking of waking ups he has been waking up waaaayyy more often too. like every 2 hours or less. otherwise he is a bubbly, happy, curious boy we love him to pieces. i am just wondering could we be hitting the 8months sleep regression early? will the night feedings decrease? i am worried that weve created a habbit and now it will be hard to transition back to at least one feeding per night and longer stretches of sleep has anyone gone through the same or similar? could you share your experience?	average_pinecone	/r/Mommit/comments/opz3oc/how_to_end_night_feedings_7mo/	7	1	0	1.0	1627033696.0

mama of two needing advice!	cross post. hey families! i'm struggling. cry everyday struggling. i have a wonderfully smart, caring and energetic 2 year old at home and an 8 week old newborn. my toddler has been great in welcoming sister into the family and for the most part is not showing any jealousy or big hard feelings about it. i am beyond grateful. but its still so hard. i have mega mom guilt because i am no where near the parent i was before becoming pregnant. my toddler son is really active and we spent days outside walking, exploring, playing sports, swimming... and now i find myself turning on the tv because i dont have the energy to do anything and the needs of his sister prevent us from doing much. it seems someone is always needing a diaper change, snack, bottle, needing some affection, having a cry.... when i do cave and let sister sleep away in her car seat to enjoy some playtime outside with my toddler, i feel guilty that she is not on a schedule and it might mess up her night sleep. and let's not get started on sleep.... if i get maybe 5 broken hours between feeds, i'm lucky. i desperately need her to sleep better but i am against cio and want to meet her fourth trimester needs for her mama. i am beyond grateful for my children and i do feel so lucky they are happy kids. but i am constantly crying guilty and generally overwhelmed. i don't have family in the same province so i'm doing this solo. any advice? how are you multi-child families managing?

how to tactfully address having my kids clothes overtaken by sil?	so, i made an account specifically for this because i am completely at my wits end. this may get lengthy, but bare with me. my husband and i have been married for 11 years and we have 4 children. when we were first married, we struggled financially, as most young couples do. we had two kids at the time. during this time, mil helped us out financially here and there, but we quickly got on our own two feet and have been living quite comfortably for a few years. were able to buy the kids nice shoes, under armour, nike, adidas, whatever clothes they want. theyre growing very quickly so ive spent thousands of dollars on clothes over the past 2 years easily. . my intent was to save my oldest boys clothes and pass them down to my younger boys as they got bigger to get good use out of the money i was spending. but over the past 5 or so years, i havent been able to find their nicer clothes at home and have seen my sil kids wearing the clothes i bought for my kids. im constantly having to replace the clothes i bought just months ago. my kids go to my in-laws very frequently and stay the night and they do help out with crazy sports schedules for the boys. theyre actually pretty awesome in-laws. mil buys clothes for them at her own will so she will have stuff for them to wear when theyre at my house, but my clothes are never returned. and yes, i have asked my husband to address this several times and he thinks im being rude because of all the great things mil does for us, etc. im an introvert and hate confrontation so ive basically been conflicted on how to handle it. nearly every time i see my nephews, they have on the exact clothes i bought for my kids. this has been ongoing for years. sil and bil make a comfortable living, but are constantly needing financial help from mil because they live above their means. sil always has nails/hair done paid for by mil. not my business but kind of annoying because im shelling out money to keep my kids clothed and she hijacks their things, maybe unintentionally? having said that, i just feel that if my kid had on unfamiliar clothes, i would ask mil about it so they could be washed/returned. but nope, nada. i have made indirect comments to mil about spending money replacing clothes constantly, but she just laughs and says theyre growing fast/thats how it is raising boys. i work hard to provide for my family, and it makes me sick to think of how much money i have indirectly donated to sil. when im home, i make my kids change clothes before going to mils, but i work long hours so sometimes im not home when they leave. asked husband to have them change, and he thinks im being petty. how should i handle this and put this to an end?

suggestions baby rolling over	okay moms out there i need some help/suggestions. my 3 month old had learned how to roll from her back to her tummy and wants to do it all the time. however, she is not so good at going from her tummy to her back. this is causing a problem at bed time. i lay her on her back once shes asleep but if she wakes up at all she rolls herself on her tummy and sometimes this fully wakes her. she then gets frustrated and fusses because she cant get back to her back. which means shes not sleeping and neither am i. any suggestions on how to keep a rolling baby on her back or side at night?	sdbarns	/r/Mommit/comments/ose9si/suggestions_baby_rolling_over/	6	2	0	1.0	1627353779.0
not sure how to feel about not being pregnant	so since having my daughter last september, i've constantly said that i want to wait a bit before having another one. we're planning on moving a fair distance in sept 2022, and i wanted to have at least a few months working at my new job before trying again. however due to a mix up i had a week of no contraceptive pill, and so there was a possibility that i could've been pregnant. my period arrived this week, and i honestly don't know how i feel. a bit upset? logically i know it's a good thing, and i adore all the one on one time i get to spend with my daughter and just really enjoy being a mum of one before the chaos of a second appears. but i had also really liked the possibility of them being close in age as well. not really looking for advice advice, just needed to get it out!

how to get through this?	hi all, just looking for encouragement. my lo is 13 weeks and sick - i dont want to get into it but hes on antibiotics and when hes done will have to get an ultrasound with the possibility of surgery . the antibiotics make his stomach hurt and its so hard for me to watch him in pain. i try to do everything i can to relieve him but his ped said it will likely continue to be uncomfortable and basically all i can do is try to help alleviate some of the discomfort. im also super anxious about the ultrasound results and the fact that we have to wait until august 1 when hes done with the antibiotics is making it worse. he was already not sleeping through the night but now hes waking every 2 hours in pain. the last two weeks i have developed insomnia - all day long i obsess about sleep, knowing i wont be able to go to sleep for my shift which ends up being a self fulfilling prophecy. im exclusively pumping but i have dmer so i get emotional during let downs and im an overproducer, so ive been trying to wean but its taking forever . i also lost my grandma, who adopted me at birth, when my lo was 2 weeks old and ive been dealing with intense grief since then. im in therapy for ppd/ppa, just got started back on zoloft which i took before i was pregnant, and am trying to practice good sleep hygiene. i know im basically doing all i can but its sooo hard some days. what can i tell myself to get through this time?	illeshamarie	/r/Mommit/comments/osw9xo/how_to_get_through_this/	3	6	0	1.0	1627423252.0

how to juggle it all?	hello fellow moms. how do you keep the baby well looked after and loved all while keeping the house clean, dinner cooked before the sun goes down, work taken care of, have a relationship with the spouse, and still sleep? im a ftm and im having a hard time getting it all done. i wasnt great at time management or organizing/cleaning before baby, but now its non-existent. my house is a wreck. i work full time and so does husband - he works from home, but cant really do housework. when i come home after work, the 9 month old takes all the time and attention from 5-8. usually husband helps with this and i can cook dinner or decompress some. the baby doesnt want to wait for our meal so we end up feeding him and then get baby ready for bed. he usually wants to go straight to bed, so dinner isnt cooked until after 8pm. i get up early so i go to bed by 10. im just feeling so lost and inadequate. i hate eating so late and it leads to a messy house because i crash. any advice would be helpful. thank you! edit thank you so much for all the advice! i feel like i can breath again. i didnt realize how much pressure i was putting on myself to be perfect though i know perfect doesnt exist. im going to try the crockpot meals and building a soft routine for us and look into having someone help clean. sounds great too! honestly i thought by 9 months i would have this down. i giggle at that thought now. i have to accept that mom brain is a thing and i have to adjust to it. thank you again!	cabeswater82	/r/Mommit/comments/otj2ov/how_to_juggle_it_all/	13	8	0	0.9	1627506513.0
looking for advice moving toddler into new room for new baby?	we have a second child on the way. currently my 2.5 yr old son is in a small bedroom that hes very attached to. the new babys room is larger and my husband feels our son should move into the bigger bedroom because our son is older and can utilize the space sooner. currently his room is where he prefers to go when hes upset and loves just laying in his toddler bed . i fear he is only going to see the baby replacing him if his old nursery/room is used for the new baby and my husband thinks it would just be easier as the nursery furniture is already in the smaller room and our son will need more space for toys. thoughts?

need advice!	my daughter is 4 months old and attends a daycare that is part of a school going through 5th grade. she goes 2 days per week. it is a very nice day care and we have had no issues until today. i was cleaning out her school bag that was left in my car over the weekend so that i could prepare it for tomorrow. at the bottom of the bag i found a 9mm bullet casing. i called the director and await an explanation. i cannot fathom an explanation that would be appropriate or acceptable for this. neither my husband or i own or discharge weapons of any kind. i don't know what to do or think. this is evidence of a discharged weapon and at bare minimum a choking hazard. advice appreciated. update went in this morning and the director basically said she asked all the teachers and everyone denied putting it in the bag. oh, so it's no one's fault - great! total lack of explanation or responsibility so i am now awaiting a call from the principal. feeling very anxious and disappointed.	kittenergized	/r/Mommit/comments/otm906/need_advice/	14	26	0	0.96	1627516839.0

how does any mom go back to work???	i had no idea it would be like this. my mom didnt have a maternal bone in her body, and ive spent my life surrounded by working moms who seem to have fulfilled lives. i never thought i would be the kind of person who leaves her career for her kids. but my maternity leave is up in mid august and i am outrageously depressed and stressed about it. i dont want to miss a minute of my sons life. especially his infancy! he will only be little for so long, and this is the time of his life where he will need me the most. i want to be there for him when hes hungry and sad and sleepy and happy. i want to be the one who helps him reach his milestones. i want to know when hes sleeping and when hes eating. i want to help him build good habits. i want to just be his mom. i dont want to worry about pumping and storing milk for someone else to give to him. i dont want to spend the days away from him. i dont want other people raising my child. i dont want to lose our bond i had no idea how much i would love motherhood. no clue. i mean, i wanted it and knew it would bring me happiness. but i have found my calling. it has been like stepping through the threshold into a new dimension that i just couldnt understand until i was experiencing it. i have never, ever felt the way i feel now that i am a mother. i love it so much. and i think im even doing a really good job at being a mother. and i dont think im good at anything! but being my boys mom is just everything to me. he is my world. i love him so much. i keep telling myself that it must be possible. so many mothers do it. so many mothers want to do it and enjoy doing it. i just think i might not be one of those moms i couldnt care less about my job. it doesnt feel important to me anymore. i really strongly feel like my place is at home, with my boy. does anyone else feel this way? can you tell me itll get better, or that im being dramatic, that everything will work out? because right now i am freaking out. it is literally all i can think about.	korthlm	/r/Mommit/comments/otpyyg/how_does_any_mom_go_back_to_work/	23	71	0	0.96	1627530988.0

there doesn't seem to be a right decision here, someone please help me, tell me what to do.	my baby has been in elecare for 2 weeks now. her first week on this was excellent, her poop was more solid and healthy looking, she was going once or twice a day as opposed to the 15-20+ a day - i took a poopy diaper to her gi doctor today as instructed to make sure there are no more bloody stools. i was pretty confident this time there would be none because it used to be very visible, and we hadn't seen any since she started this formula. this week, she decided to have mucusy stools, but otherwise in happy smiley spirits. well her poopy diaper still tested positive for blood. doctor said we have 2 options. 1st option is to leave it for now, monitor it and hope it doesn't take months to heal her inflammation injury from the previous milk proteins ingested during all the formula changes. 2nd option is to do a scoping to take pictures of her system, receive definitive proof of the diagnosis so she can then be prescribed pentasa. and no she can't prescribe it without the scoping, i asked.... she said it would be done while she's awake but won't feel a thing... it's not a local anesthetic but something else i can't remember. but the scope goes down her throat and into her system where they take pictures. risks if we do this treatment now, she has a 95% chance of successfully taking to cows milk and other solids at 1yr old. if we don't do this, she will grow out of it, but the question is when? and her chances at a successful diet at 1yr old drops significantly. -- i should also mention she is currently taking propranolol for a hemangioma on her labia, prednisolone to jumpstart the propranolol, and famotidine to prevent ulcers. she was also hospitalized at 4 weeks due to a fever so she's been through a lot... my heart can't take this. i don't know what the right thing to do is. i love her so much and in these 9 weeks with her, i am so tired of seeing her in pain and getting poked over everything. and she just had her shots!! but on the other hand, if we do this, we can treat whatever inflammation is causing her to have bloody stools. my partner is currently sleeping and i have no one to talk to about this, but i know he's just as torn. i think his heart hurts more than mine seeing her get hurt, he's such a good pops to our little one. please help me.

advice about weird sleep problems	hi mommit! i have a weird kid and i hope some of you do, too my middle kid is six years old and he has parasomnia. for probably two or three years, hes had funny episodes of waking up at night about an hour after hes gone to bed and being totally freaked out and upset. its not night terrors but i think it qualifies as confusional arrousals. hell be confused, scared, half crying, and generally weird for maybe ten minutes, then goes right back to sleep like nothing has happened. in the morning, he never remembers a thing! so in the past, this happened maybe once a week. the pediatrician shrugged it off and said hed probably outgrow it eventually. but sorta the opposite is happening! its starting to get more frequent! its been every night this whole week! when do i worry? has anyone else had a kid with weird sleep things? and dr google is no helpare there even any treatments for something like this?!

how to decide whether to be a sahm?	i have a 14 month old and have a job where i make good money. but, it is so so sooo stressful juggling my daughter and my job. and we just went back to the offices so i am away from my daughter for most of the day. my husband is a teleradiologist so he works from home and takes care of our daughter when the nanny isn't there. my reasoning for being a sahm we are fortunate enough to have the privilege of being financially secure so i could be a sahm. i have missed out on bonding time with my daughter the past 2 months since i have now gone back to the office and don't get to spend as much time with her now. i really miss staying at home with her all day, even though i had to work i could hold her as i did some work. i could do some stock trading during the day so i would still bring in some income. my husband's job has great benefits as well. if i decide to start working again, i have good connections to get a good job. my reasoning for not being a sahm our yearly income would be reduced quite a bit. i would be slowing down my career growth - i am in a great position right now and can continue to scale the ladder with my connections, but if i stop working for a few years i could get a good job back but my career growth would be much slower, almost a plateau. i enjoy my job and it brings me joy. we have a nanny who is really good with our daughter, does a great job teaching her, and my daughter loves her - she is all around amazing. i am honestly stumped. i don't know what to decide! sahm's how did you decide to become one? non-sahm's, what stopped you? i really need some opinions on what to do. what should i decide? are there any other factors i should consider?	rubberyblubber	/r/Mommit/comments/oud41b/how_to_decide_whether_to_be_a_sahm/	5	3	0	1.0	1627616973.0
how do you feel about sending kids to school with covid on the rise?	my kids are supposed to start preschool and kindergarten this year. covid in my area has gotten pretty bad again & no one is wearing masks, vaccinated or not. im not here to push the issue about getting vaccinated but im genuinely concerned about my kids safety returning to school. our governor has recently reinstated the mask mandate for state buildings and recommends kids over two wear a mask and teachers who are unvaccinated to wear a mask. however, i just feel like its going to be very difficult to make 25 5 year olds keep a mask on the proper way. also, im a nurse and i work in a long term care facility. i am vaccinated but with the new delta variant on the rise, i dont want to unknowingly contract the virus and send my kids to school to spread it. but my kids need that experience. they need interaction with other kids their age. i want them to grow & develop like theyre supposed to but i do not want to contribute to the pandemic numbers and i dont know what id do if one of my kids ended up on a vent. what are your thoughts?

when does it really get better?	i have a beautiful, wonderful, incredibly easy and smart two-year-old. she's already way easier to take care of in some ways - she can feed herself with her hands, she can assist in getting her clothes on and off, she can even kind of entertain herself for brief periods . but i very much miss my old hobbies. some things i probably won't be able to do for a while, just because - pandemic. i miss going out for drinks and meals, going to the gym, stuff like that. but i also miss being able to read a book, or knit, or even just plan to knit - find a pattern or shop for a yarn online. it seems like whatever i try to do, i get interrupted a million times. most days i feel like i'm so busy between work and taking care of everybody else, i'm lucky if i get a chance to minimally take care of myself - like, take a shower, brush my teeth. when were you guys able to start getting back to your pre-baby activities, your old selves? is there an age or a stage i can look forward to?	pdx_duckling	/r/Mommit/comments/ovcijz/when_does_it_really_get_better/	2	3	0	0.8	1627756813.0

parenting style challenges	firstly, i just want to say i'm not looking to judge anyone's parenting decisions. i recognize it's hard for most everyone, we all make mistakes/changes, and the last thing we all need is more judgement. i've just recently found myself struggling a bit with this situation and wondered if anyone had a similar experience and/or advice on how to keep moving forward as happily as possible for everyone involved. sorry about the length and thanks for reading my husband and i have friends with a kid about a year older than ours. we spoke about different parenting styles before ours was even born and we all decided we leaned most toward authoritative. i felt like we connected further the more we spoke because we had similar views, plans, and ideas of how we were going to raise our kids. it made sense to stoke the relationship and build them into our village and we were excited to be able to raise our kids with such great friends around. move forward to today where our kids are 1 and 2 and i'm just really confused after every visit and play date and it's getting harder for me to keep wanting to connect. their child is rarely told no/redirected and nothing is done when they take something from our kid . when they shove/push/grab our kid, it's all just verbal explanation of why that's not nice and the wordage is not toddler-friendly so it's not really addressed. they allow their child to wander our house, rummage in the cabinets, and they hand her things she asks for that are up high or behind a baby gate. she is free to pick up anything in our house that is food and eat it, without even asking. but we've been told we are suckers for giving their child snacks that we are okay with sharing and asked for parent permission for. they get upset when we tell their child no, but don't guide them on their own. i mostly try to step in only when someone will get hurt or the child takes something from my kid who is not verbal yet and cannot express herself because i want to respect them as parents and their choices. also, anything our kid has is fair game for their's and thus my kid is told to share with their child. i understand community, and village, and sharing and see value in all of that. i just am having a hard time understanding their departure from authoritative to basically permissive parenting, especially when my kids well-being is not considered, it seems. i wouldn't let my kid take things or be aggressive to theirs, and i thought it was the same for them. how do you navigate, personally, coming to terms with different parenting styles? am i just nitpicking and judging them like i wouldn't want to be judged? i want to stay connected with them and it is probably just where i'm at in my life and in my own parenting journey, but it just feels harder than it should be and honestly it feels like we get taken advantage of with how much grace we try to give too. i'd like a different perspective to stave off building resentment, and recognize a lot of my feelings are my own to tackle, but i'd also love some input and maybe even some solidarity that it's not just me being me anxious, type-a self. thanks again for reading!	boredbutbusymom	/r/Mommit/comments/ovi2pk/parenting_style_challenges/	5	3	0	1.0	1627776797.0

how much milk for 10 month old for 3 days?	i am going out of town this weekend, we leave friday morning and will be back sunday afternoon/evening. my 10 month old is staying with my parents. she breastfeeds on demand so i honestly dont have a clue how much she eats in a day. i have 45 oz pumped at the moment, hoping i can have about 60-70oz pumped by thursday. im slightly freaking out that it wont be enough or i wont be able to pump that much before we leave. i pump once a day after she goes to bed, its really all i have time for and thats when i get the most out of pumping. she eats 3 meals and 2 snacks a day. how many oz do your 10 months take a day? im wondering if i should buy a can of formula just in case she needs to supplement. or does anyone have a trick on how to pump a ton in two days??

sleep advice for stubborn/needy baby?	hi all, i have a baby just over 4 months old, who used to be an okay sleeper but we have been going through this 4 month sleep regression already for... i don't even know. a month?? he used to wake about 2-3x a night . now he wakes up nearly every hour, sometimes more often than that. even though we were aware of the advice to put baby down awake but drowsy we usually rocked him to sleep because if we didn't, he usually escaped his swaddle and woke himself up more often during the night with flailing arms. however, we have always put him back to sleep after non-feeding wakings by just a hand on him in the crib/bassinet, replacing the pacifier, and singing or shushing. more recently we are trying to put him down still awake, just using those middle-of-the-night methods to put him to sleep. this hasn't helped at all for his nighttime wakings. in fact, in recent weeks he has been harder than ever to put back to sleep, sometimes even needing to be picked up . i have investigated lots of different sleep training methods and courses, but it seems like all the different courses are just various flavors of cry-it-out, some being more or less gentle. i know my son and when he cries he just works himself up more and more. i can't imagine how long it would take him to cry it out, and when he gets more upset, almost nothing seems to work to calm him. neither my husband or i seem to have the fortitude to stay up all night and try and wait him out. are we just stuck living like this? are there methods we haven't considered? taking any and all advice here. please!

does anyone get seriously bored playing with a toddler like me?	my lo is nearly 2.5yo. hes healthy, happy and active so i do feel very lucky and i do love him! he doesnt speak much only says very few words and some sounds. during covid lockdown, we spend all day at home and i feel that im obliged to play and attend to him all day. i do get breaks but i still feel so bored whenever i have to play with him. that means having to read the same books/pages over and over, sing the same songs for the 1001th time, repeat the same words for the 1002th time and he still doesnt repeat them. i accept that my baby has some speech delay but i just get bored of the same content that he demands. i try to sing new songs, read new books, play new games, buy new toys, but somehow im still stuck in this super bored mindset. this thinking has recently affected my relationship too. the guy i dated and really liked wanted kids and i realise that i dont want to spend another few years of my life doing all this again. so we broke up. covid lockdown certainly is a key factor but i want to figure out a way which helps me enjoy play time with my lo. i think i have very little patience and short attention span, so cannot attend to repetitive insistent requests and demands day in day out. i wish i could find joy but im so stuck feeling despair and seeing playtime as chores rather than a bonding opportunity or happy loving mother-son time.	darkpeonies	/r/Mommit/comments/oyzssd/does_anyone_get_seriously_bored_playing_with_a/	28	46	0	0.96	1628225332.0

movie suggestions for sensitive kids, preschool aged	hi all. i'm mom to a 4 year old with a tender heart. he's a sensitive little fella. i have a difficult time finding shows or movies that don't make him feel scared, upset, or intimidated. there's always a villain or bully or some intense scene that makes us shut the movie off. basically all disney movies. i am sort of disappointed at how terribly characters in kid's shows and movies talk to one another too. lots of calling names and stupid etc. for shows, we have been lucky to discover a few gems. bluey, trash truck, grizzy and the lemmings, old winnie the pooh to name a few. movies have been a challenge though. i would love to hear some suggestions! eta i just remembered spirit and puffin rock are really good too. tv shows we've had pretty good luck with i suppose. movies not so much.

thoughts on kid 2 baby shower when 1 was virtual?	really just want some thoughts or ideas about having an actual baby shower when having a second kid after the first pregnancy was during quarantine. i thought getting opinions while still in this 2020/2021 mess would be interesting. our first kid came a few months into quarantine so baby shower was virtual in may 2020. what i really missed was seeing people in person, especially the family from further away, and really celebrating the pregnancy. i did appreciate the virtual shower but i keep thinking what it would have been like to have a party not needing an internet connection. not planning for another kid for a bit and the norm around me is a 'sprinkle' or nothing at all. my struggle is that we've saved most baby things you would get from a shower. we use cloth diapers too so a diaper shower wouldn't even be necessary. so would a full blown shower, a sprinkle, or even just a party to have a party be appropriate? no gifts but getting together to celebrate. another facet of this is feeling like i and my partner missed out on some pregnancy related things. the belly touching was obviously nice to escape but going to appointments together, meeting other parents, and physical birth classes never happened because of 2020/2021. his family didn't even stay for the virtual baby shower, max 10 minutes before they went to get coffee. he was disappointed by that and doubtful the same would have happened in-person.

what age do babies stop getting milk drunk?	my step mom commented that my son isnt milk drunk after a feeding and said she thinks hes not being fed enough. it had me thinking that he hasnt been milk drunk in a while unless its in the middle of the night. i couldnt find the answer online but babies stop getting tired after feedings at some age right? its more of a newborn thing? he usually is hungry when he wakes up, eats, wants to play and be awake for an hour or two then naps and repeats. is this normal? he was born sga but been on his growth curve every appointment. his eating and size have always been sensitive to me for this reason.	socal62020	/r/Mommit/comments/p0ntto/what_age_do_babies_stop_getting_milk_drunk/	6	2	0	1.0	1628459545.0
at what point can you spoil a baby?	i am a first time mom & i have a 3 month old velcro baby. i pick her up & comfort her every time she cries. i baby wear a lot. i generally do whatever i can to keep her content all day, because hearing her cry stresses me out & because it just feels natural & right to remedy her crying if i can. however, a lot of my loved ones make comments about her being spoiled & implying shes going to need to be held nonstop forever because i am spoiling her. is this a thing? honestly, even in the last couple weeks she has become more independent & is willing to lay on her little play gym & bat at toys for a while without getting upset. she no longer panics any time i put her in a swing or bouncer. it seems to me like she will just naturally become more independent as she gets older & more curious. am i correct in thinking this? everyone says you cant spoil a baby. is that true? if you can spoil a baby, at what age does that become an issue?	sleepygirl2997	/r/Mommit/comments/p0nvi3/at_what_point_can_you_spoil_a_baby/	64	94	0	0.99	1628459699.0
when do you stop sleeping with your babies?	so i have been cosleeping with my daughter in her room since she was 6 months and now shes 2 years old. we still cosleep at night. my very loving husband is not bothered by this as he works overnight shifts 4-5 times a week anyway. however, i have been hearing things like isnt she too old for that? or do you plan to sleep with her forever? from my circle of people and it makes me feel unsure. i always thought id stop when shes older . i spend the majority of my day at work, missing my daughter, and being there for her at nighttime makes me feel like im actually her mom and not just her daycare chauffeur. does anyone else cosleep with their toddlers? is it not a good thing?	cocovacado	/r/Mommit/comments/p0sm1k/when_do_you_stop_sleeping_with_your_babies/	17	9	0	0.85	1628476856.0

limiting nighttime feedings advice needed!	ftm with an almost 6 month old. i was very fortunate that from 2-4 months he slept through the night. at 4 months our pediatrician said he was ready for solids and he is a great eater! he eats 4oz of pures two times a day. however, he has started waking up at night at least 2-3 times demanding to be fed . its not a comfort feed either, because he will eat between 5-6oz each time he wakes up and will immediately fall back asleep when he has finished the bottle. i want to get him full during the day rather than filling up at night and interrupting his sleep. anyone have any advice how to cut down on nighttime feeds and encourage him to eat during the day?	vrichmond	/r/Mommit/comments/p1567i/limiting_nighttime_feedings_advice_needed/	2	1	0	1.0	1628527318.0
how do you wash your mobile babys hair?	ever since my daughter could crawl at 6 months shes all over the bathtub, i used to just lay her on her back go get her hair wet and rinse out the shampoo. now, she wont sit still! its an impossible task to wash her hair. ive started to count out loud to 3 and then pour it on her head hoping she will learn that on 3 she needs to hold her breath? i dont know what else to do, but i feel like im waterboarding my poor daughter. on another note, her bellybutton is super deep and i cant find a good way to clean it out. theres dirt or something in the creases and its too narrow to get it out. ive used q-tips, washcloths, my finger. not sure what to do there either.

why does the mommy on the bus say shh shh shh while the daddy on the bus says i love you ?	i recognize that i am thinking way too much about a children's song. i also recognize that the daddy on the bus was probably added in later to be more inclusive to fathers etc. but really? the mommy is making sure that the baby is being quiet on the bus, while the daddy just gets to love on the baby. that's always bothered me in a small, insignificant way. but i'm reminded of it every time i hear the song which is often since my kids love it and love to sing it.	well_hello_there13	/r/Mommit/comments/p1b248/why_does_the_mommy_on_the_bus_say_shh_shh_shh/	145	338	0	0.97	1628544817.0
looking for advice and support on feeling guilty	from time to time i feel guilty for my daughter . she spends 7 hours in kindergarten four days a week while we work. she is very social and seems to love it there. she eats and sleeps well and we still breastfeed. we have fun together before bedtime and she is so playful and silly. she loooves to cuddle and she will say things like come here and cuddlezzz which melts my heart. the guilt comes when i think that we should be together more, even though summer break was exhausting for the both of us. she got bored and we got tired, because we just cant offer the stimulation that kindergarten can. so its just this weird feeling - i know kindergarten is good for her but its weird to be away from each other. also when i think about going to the gym or whatever after work i feel so guilty for the precious few hours we have before bed time. i dont cry like i could do before so i have come a long way. someone please just tell me that this is normal, i need to hear something like that. tell me you experience it too please.

saddened with husband's family behavior on social media. feel like we lost a battle when protecting our child's presence on social media.	i feel like we lost a battle as parents with our child on social media. i feel like i let my child down as a parent. in a nutshell, husband confronted his sister three times to not post pictures of our child and remove the 100+ pictures of our child since his birth. she also felt it was appropriate to post 100+ of our wedding on facebook despite us not wanting it on there and asking her to remove it. she had zero role in the wedding besides manning the guestbook table. as parents, we believe it is in our child's best interest and wishes long term to decide how we want to help our child guide through social media and be there to support them. i have to admit i feel a bit disappointed in my husband, because i feel that he does not have the maturity or projected energy to stand up to his family enough to fight for his child. it is my understanding with a marriage that when there are difficult behaviors that the spouse associated to the member with the difficult behavior manages the situation. i also feel in retrospect the sister used our child as pawn to garner attention about herself and also as a way to obtain attention from her brother . husband said that after confronting her three times, she says she forgot and does not understand why it is wrong. he feels now that it is a moot battle to discuss this issue with her any further and no win and let things be. i feel sympathy for his sister since her past behavior has shown her to be difficult and she does not have any friends because of this. when we brought this issue up to husband's mother she said the issue is our problem. even when we voiced our issues as to why we do not want our child's pictures on there. i am fully aware of the options on facebook. example i am not seeking advice on how to talk to facbook staff. this is more of an interpersonal relationship problem at this point i feel.

how do you survive the terrible twos?	the past few weeks, it feels like my daughter has been different and like she has fully entered the terrible twos. she is 22 months now. she still does amazing and cute things every day, but then there have also been some extremely distressing incidents. like this morning to make a long story short, she got a hold of a tin of candy and wanted me to open it and put a bunch in her mouth. when i took it away, she had a complete meltdown. she started ~~screaming~~ shrieking like a banshee. this was well before her naptime. it had been a perfectly normal morning up until that point with nothing at all to provoke this. obviously, she gets crankier and more sensitive the more tired, hungry, etc she gets, but that wasnt the case here and it took hours for her to fully get back to normal. i mean, i do think she might fall a bit more on the sensitive side of things overall, but this was seriously so out of the blue. and i just dont know what to do. i feel like my husband and i are on the verge of a nervous breakdown, at least i sure am. it is so hard for me to deal with these kinds of tantrums. ive always been very sensitive to her crying, even though she cries all the time and we went through sleep training, but this is nothing like that. its even worse than when she hurts herself. i cant even describe how ear-piercingly awful this screeching is that shes been doing lately. i feel like i have to deaden myself inside to not try to instantly placate her. im trying not to sound too ridiculously over the top as i write this, but honestly i could go on and on about the issues that i and weve been having as a family that just make it all the worse. its just so hard and sometimes i think how am i going to survive the next year with my will and marriage intact?	celestialbebe	/r/Mommit/comments/p1ekd7/how_do_you_survive_the_terrible_twos/	15	3	0	1.0	1628556595.0
need help / advice with flaky mom	i became friendly with one of my daughters friends mom. we chatted a number of times, and bonded over some shared interests. our daughters were already friends through school. ive tried to set up playdates with this woman a number of times and every time, within an hour of the scheduled time, she cancels. the first couple times it was met with i'm so sorry, let's re schedule but this last time when i told her we weren't available the following day, she never responded. it's always an injury or illness as to why the child can't play. i'm fb friends with both parents. the day before my daughter's last playdate, the father of the kid posted about how his daughter was having a friend sleep over at their house.... conveniently, the daughter woke up with a fever and couldn't come over , 25 minutes before she was supposed to. if it were just me, i would just stop interacting with this woman. she's rude af, inconsiderate, and my daughter was really upset. thing is, the girls are friends. how do i handle this woman when we cross paths again? our school district is not that big, and they are elementary age. thnaks for any advice you can give, after sleeping on it, i'm still pretty pissed and unsure how to proceed.	andiroos1214	/r/Mommit/comments/p1nt8u/need_help_advice_with_flaky_mom/	16	14	0	0.95	1628597057.0
i just want to scream and crybut i dont even have time for that	i have 12 & 10 year old girls who sweet and beautiful but also like 99% of the time are trying to kill each otheror something. they cannot get along for even 5 minutes it seems. this part has been so much harder than the toddler years. on top of that, my mil drives me crazy 24/7/365 and i live next door! shes just insane and demanding and nosy. then theres my husband who is walking on egg shells around me because he thinks im mad at him and that im going to leave or whatever. i told him last night that if i wanted to divorce him, id have already done it. im in it for the long haul. my kids had me so stressed today that i cussed and screamed. all we were trying to do is make brownies together and they had to find something to argue about that. my 12 year old is very immature for her age and constantly tattle tales. my 10 year old is like an old woman in a childs body and she wants to take matters into her own hands. this leaves me stuck in the middle constantly playing referee, stuck in a vicious cycle. my husband works hard all day and i cant wait for him to get home just so i can have a break. and thats not fair to him. usually he will chill for like an hour to unwind before he has to jump in and take over. i dont know where ive gone wrong but i cant hardly take this anymore.	bluegrassmommy	/r/Mommit/comments/p1s416/i_just_want_to_scream_and_crybut_i_dont_even_have/	10	7	0	0.9	1628611169.0

how long has the fussy at the breast period lasted for you?	i am simply ready to give up. my son started being fussy at the breast two months ago and still is at 4 months. and its not the kind of fussy that will still allow him to breastfeed for the full meal. its the kicking legs, back arching, doing crunches, unlatching and latching multiple times, hitting my breast with his fist kind of feeding. we then give up after 2-3 min and offer bottle of expressed breastmilk. he still does this at the bottle, but its easier to manage. but i cant do this anymore! the only decent breastfeeding sessions we have are at night. if anyone else has experienced this, please tell me its a phase and how long has it lasted for you? thank you in advance!	imma_mamma	/r/Mommit/comments/p1ut1t/how_long_has_the_fussy_at_the_breast_period/	15	1	0	0.67	1628618948.0
can you share your success stories? between existing expenses, awful maternity leave policy, and eventually childcare, i have no idea how we are going to get through this.	husband and i both make around $40,000 and each had our share of expenses but were living pretty comfortably...then i found out i was pregnant. we both wanted to be parents, but weren't planning on it happening for a few more years. the financial aspects of this are making us panic. the biggest thing killing us is the maternity leave policy at my job... it's completely unpaid, and they are paying 75% of my health insurance for 6 weeks. meaning, for 6 weeks i'm on the hook for 25% of my health insurance premium, and after that i have to pay 100% until i return from leave. i am taking 12 weeks, part of that is there is no way there will be childcare openings in our area any sooner than that. we think we'll have enough in savings to cover my normal monthly expenses that are normally covered by my income, but it will wipe out our savings. on top of that will be a medical bill and then daycare expenses. our only saving grace is the child tax credit and then whatever we get in tax returns. how do people do this?? we have relatives if we got stuck but beyond that, i just need to hear that it'll be okay....this doesn't feel okay, and we're totally panicking.	northwest18	/r/Mommit/comments/p1v2sv/can_you_share_your_success_stories_between/	8	21	0	1.0	1628619759.0
needed to brag on my big girl real quick. anyone want to join?	my five year old has always been adamant that she wanted to homeschool. she has always struggled with separation anxiety but i also wanted to homeschool since the day she was born so this worked out fine. we homeschooled for preschool and it went great! i loved teaching her and watching her learn and accomplish new things. i always knew the time would come when she was ready to go out into the world and spread her wings but i did not expect it to be this year! one month before school started she came up to me and said i am ready to go to school so confidently and so matter of fact that i almost thought it was a temporary thing. but still, i supported her fully and we talked about everything school would entail. she never wavered except one time when she timidly said she changed her mind. even though part of me wanted to jump on that and say great! lets homeschool! i explained to her that this seemed like something she was excited for and i encouraged her to keep moving forward with it. well, she did just that! today was her first day and she hardly hugged me goodbye before i left her classroom she was so excited. i am so unbelievably proud of her for making this decision on her own and seeing it through. i cant wait for her to get home and to hear all about her day. who else has some bragging to do?! edited to add her day went great! she said she hardly even missed me she had so much fun. shes so excited to go back tomorrow and i couldnt be more proud 	ccfenix	/r/Mommit/comments/p1vecg/needed_to_brag_on_my_big_girl_real_quick_anyone/	40	315	0	0.98	1628620703.0
need advice on lack of report filed by daycare	my daughter has been in daycare for a week and a half. today she returned home with three bruises on the side of her head. my husband picked her up and said the daycare didnt mention any accidents. i called immediately, and they said they had no accidents on file - she fell off the cot shes supposed to nap on but didnt cry or fuss so they didnt mention it. also said they clip her hair back but didnt notice it. i meanthis is a big cluster of bruises. i texted the director a photo and waited for a response. in the meantime called the pediatrician to make sure we didnt need to bring her in and the pediatrician said it was concerning the daycare didnt mention this to me. so. thats fun. her teacher called me and was extremely apologetic and was like, im a mom, i understand, i just saw the pictures and im so sorry. it may have happened when she fell off the cot and i was in the bathroom so another teacher was watching her. ill make sure to check her for bruises every day and just watch her really carefully. i said thanks but i didnt understand how they didnt notice it, and she again was very apologetic but said she didnt know how it happened. my husband and i really need childcare support now and im worried im looking at this through rose colored glasses because we need help. i really liked this daycare, but come to think of it, lo has come home with bruises on her legs and i just assumed it was her falling, but now i feel likewhy didnt they tell me? shouldnt they be telling me this kind of stuff? i dont know what to dodo we pull her out?	littlebabybuddy24	/r/Mommit/comments/p1zi8h/need_advice_on_lack_of_report_filed_by_daycare/	22	14	0	0.82	1628633274.0
any tips on babysitting a non-verbal down syndrome child along with my 18 month old?	 sigh not sure where to post this, so im hoping you wonderful moms can help. my aunt is in a very desperate situation and needs a sitter tomorrow from 7 am to 5 30 pm. there is absolutely nobody who can help her and she is going to see a dying family member. i know its just one day, but i have a lot of anxiety about tomorrow and i need advice. i am literally starting to hyperventilate. i have a very rambunctious and tantrum-throwing, shrieking 18 month old. she is in the most difficult stage right now for me. my little cousin is 7 years old, but severely down syndrome. he is non-verbal, walks with foot braces, but isnt usually too hard, other than he can really get into things. he also likes to throw stuff around the room. what do i do? i dont know how to mix these two kids in my small apartment. i will be alone, my husband works all day. my baby doesnt know how to handle a change in routine, so i am nervous about how she will react to him. and i have some intense anxiety and post partum stuff still lingering that has made it hard to function anyway. does anyone have a down syndrome child/ child with disabilities that has advice for me? or even parents of multiples or with lots of kids? idk why this is rocking my world so much, but it is. my aunt has already left and i dont want to bother her. but my uncle is bringing my cousin tomorrow when he leaves to join my aunt. i dont know what id even ask him anyway. i guess i am just looking for any ideas to keep myself functioning and to keep these kids alive and not screaming for 10 hours. im begging- any advice is helpful!!!	juliaakatrinaa0507	/r/Mommit/comments/p24u34/any_tips_on_babysitting_a_nonverbal_down_syndrome/	4	4	0	1.0	1628652068.0
who am i?	i am a mom to a freshly 1 y/o daughter, and i left my job as a teacher to be a sahm right after she was born. i am watching all my friends go back to school right now, and teach their hearts out. i am a little jealous. idk, this time of year is just tricky because i can imagine setting up my elementary classroom, greeting a new group of kiddos, becoming a classroom community, bsing with my teacher friends, etc. instead, im sitting at home, cleaning the floors, doing laundry and telling my friends how cute their classrooms are. i love being a sahm, but i feel so isolated. my husband and i dont know many people in our town, and between that, the pandemic and becoming a sahm, i dont get much social interaction besides texting friends. i sometimes i wonder if id be happier at a job, where i could interact with others. but i dont want to leave my daughter at daycare, and i enjoy being home with her. i sometimes feel like i missed some secret sahm group, where all the moms know each other and hang out. this pandemic is so rough and i know im not the only one pandemic-ed out, but damn. with cases going up again and the delta variant so much more infectious, i just cant even consider going out with my lo. even if we could go out and explore our community, idk where we would go. tl;dr i miss teaching. i miss my friends. i love being at home with my lo, but damn this pandemic makes things hard and isolating. edit title is not overly accurate but cant edit after posting, so whoops	MNmama7	/r/Mommit/comments/p2d2h5/who_am_i/	14	16	0	0.91	1628688510.0

i am desperate for advice right now about how to handle life with a toddler? i just dont know what to do anymore.	i think i am losing my mind right now and i dont know where to turn. i have a little bit of anxiety and i do have depression but i am medicated and it has seemed to help over the years. i also recently started therapy but things have gotten worse. i literally hate being a mom right now. i love my daughter and she is funny and beautiful. i also love my husband but he doesnt seem to understand me lately and i dont really understand myself either so i dont blame him. maybe i am just not a nurturing person? maybe im lazy? maybe im just broken? i just hate waking up in the morning to deal with the daily mundane tasks of having a shrieking toddler in my ear. her tantrums are causing rage in me that is getting harder and harder to control. i havent hurt her or lost it on her or anything, i just have this fire burning in me so deeply all day long. and what sucks? i hated working. i hated it with all my heart. i wanted to be a mom so bad, and now that i am, its too much for me and i feel trapped. but going back to put my baby in daycare feels so much worse and i am dreading that even more. maybe i just hate life. literally every aspect of life is hard for me lately. i have been a bad wife and mom lately and i dont know how to be better. i just get overwhelmed so easily and then my husband gets sad and mad at me because he thinks that i have a perfect life that he would die for and cant handle me complaining. but like i have to babysit tomorrow for a cousin for one day. i am having a serious meltdown over it. i dont know why! i am literally in a huge embarrassing fight with my husband over it right now on a trip with friends. i cant sleep and i just dread waking up every morning to face being a mom and doing anything extra is just so much for me! but i am a stay at home mom. its not that hard, like to the level that i feel that it is. so i just dont know what to do. my therapist is taking a very slow approach to this and it isnt helping me. i am approaching a very dark place right now and i am just reaching out for any help right now. thank you. tldr- really struggling with being a mom and just, life in general and i dont know where to turn.	juliaakatrinaa0507	/r/Mommit/comments/p2k7s5/i_am_desperate_for_advice_right_now_about_how_to/	3	6	0	1.0	1628710104.0
a mom who does it all?	i became a first time mom in this pandemic, giving birth in december while wearing a mask. we decided that my husband will be the stay at home parent since my job pays well and provides stability. well, due to the pandemic, ive been able to work from home my whole pregnancy and to this day. my husband is a business owner with events and still has work coming in. we agreed he would take point on the home and baby stuff, but i find myself both having a demanding full time job and being a full time stay at home mom. on top of that, my husband goes off to work events on weekdays and weekends, leaving me to juggle everything. im about to break from doing it all, and every time i try to wave my white flag to my husband, he gets defensive and doesnt listen to my woes since he is also completely exhausted and feels like he does it all too. he isnt bringing in much money with his business but wont give it up because his identity is linked to business ownership. any moms out there that can lend any well wishes, affirmations, or validations would make me feel a little less alone in all of this. im about to have a mental and emotional breakdown, send help.	cozysquishylove25	/r/Mommit/comments/p2m2ih/a_mom_who_does_it_all/	7	3	0	1.0	1628715766.0
what decade are we in?	so i was at the store with my daughter to pick up some pads and tampons. thats all i got. a small box of tampons and a small bag of pads. i could hold both in one hand no problem. i go to check out and the old man at the register looks shocked and pulls out the biggest paper bag he could find. as he scans and bags my stuff he leans forward to whisper you really shouldnt buy these things gestures at tampons with young girls around. it will give them ideas later. well i thanked him for his advice and left as fast as i could. what year is it? its been many years since i used tampons, but i thought the stigma died after middle school. also what idea would my toddler be having other than how to throw them in the toilet or eat them? dude works in a pharmacy, but cant keep his mouth shut about patrons purchases.

advice youd give yourself if you could go back to your earlier days as a mom?	mine would be feed baby on both boobs. my right arm is so much stronger so i always gravitated on holding baby on right side and latching to right boob. probably 75% of the time we were feeding from the right. now that i finished breastfeeding and some time has passed my left boob is 2 whole cup sizes larger than the right one. it is even obvious with a shirt on. new moms take note 	cocovacado	/r/Mommit/comments/p2qzia/advice_youd_give_yourself_if_you_could_go_back_to/	26	10	0	0.86	1628732056.0
first time mom to be struggling and no idea where to ask for help.	sorry for the long post but im 6 months pregnant with my first child. i have a great full time job where i make 52,000 a year salary. however, i am not in contact with the babys father and it would be dangerous to have him in her life due to his lifestyle and i am not going to be receiving child support. my parents are unable to have me stay with them once the baby comes and i am looking at apartments for my child and i. i have no idea who to talk to or how to get help because i make too much money to receive any assistance but i make 3k a month after taxes and have 1k already a month in bills for health insurance, car and car insurance, credit cards, student loans, and cell phone. any decent apartment is like 1400 a month minimum, leaving me with 600 a month left for diapers, child care, food, her health insurance, utilities, basic necessities for my daughter and i. theres no way i can afford that. child care everywhere im looking is a minimum of 200 a week. 800 a month. im already 200 over my budget at this point. im desperately trying to stabilize some kind of environment before my baby comes and i dont know where to go. ive reached out to multiple government agencies single mom support groups, sold a bunch of my personal items and gotten rid of necessary expenses, but i just dont know where else to look next. how do people do this!? any advice would be appreciated. thanks	Singlemomm1991	/r/Mommit/comments/p2thy3/first_time_mom_to_be_struggling_and_no_idea_where/	3	2	0	0.75	1628746336.0
need advice from other quarantine baby mommas about daycare	my lo will be 1 this month and since she was born during quarantine, she really hasnt been away from me very much. it took until she was about 9 months to finally get to where she would stay the night at my moms house, and now my husband and i just started going to the gym after he gets off work, so were going to be putting her in their little daycare just while we work out. yesterday was our first day and apparently she cried for the entire hour and a half that we were gone. her big sister has been going to daycare since she was 1 so she was used to it, but i guess having her there didnt help baby sis. will it get better over time? any suggestions on what i could do to help it go a little better? big sis has always loved daycare and is pretty social so i never really had to go through this with her and it just breaks my heart that baby girl is taking it so hard.

i never want to have another baby again	i love my lo. i can feel the love, the joy of hearing him laughs, the sweetness of his hugs and kisses. i will do and give anything for this cute small person. but... i will never do this again! not having another baby. i cant justify having more sleepless nights, stressing over everything eating enough/too much, throwing up, illness, behaviours, emotional well being, brain development, safety etc. i cant justify subjecting myself to constant demands on my body, my mind, my energy . ive done it once and its more than enough. id rather focus on bringing up this lo, knowing that whatever hardship / challenge is coming, i only need to do it once and he will grow up and be well, not twice or thrice. i look forward to travelling, reading, learning, exercising, socialising, doing things i love. and i can enjoy all of this while nurturing this lo because hopefully its manageable with just 1. i thought of the idea of having 2-3 kids and truly dont know/ understand why and how i could ever decide to give up an easier, healthier lifestyle by having more than 1 child? p/s this was written after 1.5 hours trying to put toddler to sleep, trying to stop him touching and pinching my boobs . the daily recurrence of these frustrations years after years are unbearable. im just putting this down in writing to remind myself to not ever think about having another kid!	darkpeonies	/r/Mommit/comments/p31mtp/i_never_want_to_have_another_baby_again/	84	150	0	0.93	1628780545.0

unsure how to address this	my daughter has been going to daycare for years, and recently has became good friends with another little girl that goes. she wears her favorite play shoes because they are outside often and they are comfy. the other day she tells me that her friend said her shoes are not pretty and it made her sad. i asked her if she liked her shoes and she says yes, and then i told her not to worry what her friend thinks- she likes them and that is all that matters. she seemed satisfied and never brought it up. i pick her up the next day and she says, i was scared for to see my shoes today. i said whys that baby, and she said because she doesnt like them and calls them ugly. i really didnt know how to even respond, i was so mad and hurt for my daughter. how is a 3 year old already feeling insecure around the opinion of others??? i got her a different pair of shoes like she asked, but i know it is only a matter of time before they are worn in and this kid will be an asshole to my kid again. how do i help my daughter get over this fear of her friends disapproval? i might be overreacting, but my heart still hurts from her telling me that at pick up time.

i want to run away from my family	we have had it really rough the past 2 years with pregnancy, covid, losing our jobs, moving to a new city, and the list goes on. i love my baby and my husband but things keep happening. i find that no one listens to me when it comes to important stuff and then when things go wrong because they didnt listen, im expected to fix it. i feel overwhelmed. i feel taken for granted. i feel like people think its okay to walk all over me. i will admit i can be a pushover and its been hard for me to set boundaries. but recently i have been pushing myself to be more assertive and not let that happen. but then i become the bad guy for not wanting to do what everyone else wants to do. right now im at my wits end. i dont know why this has become the final straw, but it is.. we live with my mother in law, against my better judgement might i add, and things have been bad since day 1. we all share the housing costs and yet everything is always all about her and how she wants the house to look. her and my husband fight almost daily, primarily because she antagonizes him and he doesnt put up with it. hes tried harder to not fight with her but she still pushes his buttons any way she can. their relationship has plummeted hard core, and its really sad to watch. anyway, my husband, baby, and i went on a 2 week vacation recently and came home to her ex boyfriend living in our house and refusing to leave. i do not like this man. that is very clear to her. but she decided to invite him over without telling us and then started gaslighting me when i got upset with her about it, even when he refused to leave! after a couple days he finally left but then the very next day she calls and says he wants to come back and hang out, that if i have a problem with it then i can just leave. my husband thinks im overreacting but we all have a history with this man being physically and emotionally abusive. im not having him around my baby. and thats that. but now that im trying to set that boundary, im the bad guy. i rarely feel like anyone is on my side even though, without me, nothing would get done around the house. her daughter literally fainted today because her mom didnt feed her or has ever bothered to teach her how to feed herself. the poor girl wouldnt have gone to school this year if i didnt sign her up. but why is that my job?? there is so much more and im tired of thinking about it all day. im overwhelmed enough being a young mom and occasionally feeling like i made a mistake by having a baby right now. but it feels so much worse when i have to parent everyone else in this house. and they gang up on me and say im not allowed to feel this way when i express this is how im feeling. toxic toxic toxic family. how did i get here? how do i get out? my husband said i need to get a hobby but i have tons of hobbies, im just not allowed to do any of them because im so busy taking care of everyone else! i also have major anxiety, low self esteem due to pregnancy, and im going through tons of other stress with my own daily life. i talk to a therapist but talking does nothing, i need action. i need a better life for myself and my baby. all i want to do is run. take the baby and run. i dont know where ill go or how ill get there. all i know is im over it. please tell me someone is out there who understands. what did you do? did you run? was it amazing?

how did you accept your postpartum body?	i will be 12 months pp in a little less than 2 weeks. before i had my son i was really small and skinny. i could shop in the juniors section of most clothing stores. i weighed in at about 100lbs at my lightest, 110lbs at my heaviest. i gained 30 lbs with my son during pregnancy and once he was born, the belly stayed. i still look pregnant most days. for context, i am 26 and only 4'10 tall so it's understandable that any weight gained can only go outwards. i went clothes shopping today and realized that all the styles i want to wear no longer fit my body type/shape anymore and it's been really discouraging. i know that my body created, grew and nourished life for 9 months and i breastfed for 3 months. that's something to be proud of but.....i hate seeing myself in the mirror. i know that i'm a woman now and not a young, taught, vivacious teen/young adult anymore. i'm honestly really upset right now and feel a lot of self-loathing because i can't immediately change what i hate about myself. any advice, similar feelings and experience would be appreciated.

to the receptionist who implied i wasn't making my kid a priority	i needed to move his vaccine appointment because the day you picked wasn't convinient for us. i've just spent 45 mins pacing around the living room at 3am because newborn needed me to do that, i sleep 4 hours a day because newborn only sleeps on his tummy so i watch him all night. today i had a cheese sandwich and 2 slices of pizza all day because that's all i had time for, newborn is having a bad tummy day and needs to be held all the time. my kids are absolutely my priority and me needing to move the appointment you set up gives you no right to question that, you don't know who's got post partum depression or anxiety, how dare you make me feel like an awful mum because i wanted to move an appointment you set up without asking me. you're a bully and you'll carry on having a sad sad life.

when you almost make it, but baby wakes up. happens to me almost every, single, time.	my husband is gone for the night, so it's just me and our son in our little apartment. i already had my night planned perfectly. as soon as i am sure lo is asleep, i will sneak into the kitchen, make myself a grilled cheese, crack open an ipa and sit myself in front of the computer and watch literally anything while i enjoy the rarest of riches alone time. everything is going smoothly. i tip toe around as to not wake up baby. i get the computer on streaming service, quietly pop the top off my beer, get my grilled cheese going, and then i hear it. the sound is unmistakable; my heart sinks and my feet reluctantly shuffle back into our room. there he is, my sweet son who was just so sound asleep, is now awake and wailing. i see my dreams of me time drift away, they have drowned in a sea of baby tears. tonight was not the night, when is it ever? there would be no show, no alone time, no beer. there would be only a dark room and a grilled cheese sandwich. instead of eating it in the glow of computer light, i would consume it in bed out of a paper bowl, nursing my son while he watched me with curious eyes, reaching out his hand every so often to swat at my sad, sad snack. he has returned to sleep, and i suppose that i could continue with my plan. i could at least watch something, but it's late now and i have again decided that going to bed is good enough alone time for me.	vestri_layluna_birb	/r/Mommit/comments/p42g4e/when_you_almost_make_it_but_baby_wakes_up_happens/	48	100	0	0.97	1628920297.0

i just want to sleep	i lay in bed as i type this. my youngest will not let me sleep through the night. he really hasnt since before he was born. no matter what routine or trick i try hes up because he cant see me or my husband or he doesnt like his bed or whatever reason his tiny body decides. so hes in my bed in my spot next to my husband while i sleep at the foot of the bed. i have chronic back pain, my hips have not healed or gone back into place since giving birth to him a year ago. so they pop and move throughout the day as i try to do the things need to get done. im also overweight so that doesnt help things. but i swear he is the biggest cockblocker out of all my children and has made me loose more sleep than his older brothers and they are over 6 years old. my husband tries to make it so if any of our kids come to bed they go to him not me but it doesnt always work. i just want him to sleep through the night so i can have some me time maybe have sex with my husband and try to be as comfortable as i can in my own bed. and not be a bitchy zombie the next day because i couldnt sleep etc its a constant cycle one i hope breaks soon . pray for me that i might get some decent sleep soon thank you for letting me rant	Eternity071710	/r/Mommit/comments/p4nx20/i_just_want_to_sleep/	8	12	0	1.0	1629006528.0
separation anxiety. how did it look like for you?	 disclaimer posted in another community and didnt get any replies. so i wanted to try again i am just wondering how separation anxiety looked for you, especially at night. i feel like thats what we are going through right now with our 8 months old, but i am not sure. in our case, lo wakes up several times per night and doesnt calm down unless he is held. if i put him into his crop after he fell asleep again in my arms, he wakes up as soon as my warmth wears off and he realises he is no longer held. at least thats what it feels like. we have had terrible sleep for the past month or so, but the last 3 nights i put him into our bed when he woke up the first time. he slept through the night. so as long as he is in our bed, hes fine but in his crib, its at least 4 wakings per night.. anyone has gone through the same? how did it look for you and when/how did it end?	average_pinecone	/r/Mommit/comments/p4uudc/separation_anxiety_how_did_it_look_like_for_you/	15	3	0	1.0	1629038946.0
toddler wont go to bed unless you lay with him for hours and im tired of it. i need advice.	my son is a little over 2 and every single night, even if hes not taken a nap that day and is exhausted, he wont go to sleep unless myself or my mother lay with him for anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours or whenever he falls asleep. even if he does nap, same thing. honestly im tired of it. all day i take care of him, dont get anything done so i can watch him and play with him, then bedtime comes and then i loose even more time because if i dont lay with him he wont go to sleep. if im not in there he gets out of his big boy bed and plays with all his toys or cries for hours. what advice does anyone have about toddlers, bedtime and big kid beds that they have the free will to get out of. i need a break and some me time after a long day at work or a long day of literally sitting with him all day.

when is a meltdown not just a meltdown?	i have a little boy who is almost three. a typical day sees us weather several meltdowns. this morning there was 20 mins of screaming at the top of his lungs about climbing in his car seat , and weve just had an hour and a half of crying/screaming over him wanting to drink his water with a spoon, but no spoon in the drawer was correct. i get that toddlers have meltdowns about these things, but over an hour and a half of screaming? we always try to distract, redirect, offer time in to help him self-regulate. absolutely nothing calms him but time. he hates time in and screams more. being left on his own is the only thing that makes him stop eventually, which i feel guilty about but every form of contact exacerbates things. im a gentle parent but recently his dad and i have started to feel increasingly stressed by his behaviour. tonight he has woken the baby 3 times and this morning i was late to work due to his meltdown. im struggling and my confidence as a parent is being affected. is this normal toddler stuff? im starting to wonder if we need to chat to a professional. edit to add thanks so much for the kind and non-judgemental advice. ive received some great ideas to try. i now just need to breathe through my own frustrations because im a bit exhausted!	pandamonkey23	/r/Mommit/comments/p5dohg/when_is_a_meltdown_not_just_a_meltdown/	27	35	0	1.0	1629111189.0

cradle cap advice?	my daughter is five weeks old, she was born with a full head of thick hair. but her scalp and hair is literally always oily. i give her a bath about once a week and brush through her hair with a silicone brush and mild baby shampoo. but after about an hour you can tell that her scalp and hair is getting oily again. tonight i gave her a bath and washed her hair like i always do. but when i got her out and was towel drying her hair, she had greasy dead skin all around her scalp rubbing off of the towel. when i bathe her i dont necessarily scrub her scalp, i more so gently rub it then brush her hair out. so i got her back in the bath and figured i just needed to work out all the dead skin with mild baby shampoo and the silicone brush. im pretty sure i got most of it off. but because her scalp is always oily im scared that its going to come back. i feel like it must be cradle cap from the oils. but when my first had cradle cap, it was dry flakey scales. not greasy gunk. for him i did the silicone brush and coconut oil but i dont want to immediately use coconut oil on her and make it worse. should i stop using baby shampoo all together, should i go ahead with coconut oil, or is there something else i should be doing?	berrymommy	/r/Mommit/comments/p5zcch/cradle_cap_advice/	6	2	0	1.0	1629187091.0
need advice for inlaws	my baby is almost 7 weeks old. he's sooooo clingy that i can't get out of bed before 12 because i'm so tired from the nights and the crying. he's currently latched onto my chest, if i move then he wakes up, i haven't even taken my antidepressants this morning yet from fear of waking him. anyway, he usually goes to my mil every friday /saturday, but he didn't last week because of an altercation my partner and i had with her. basically, we found out she was smoking around him. or to be more specific, she'll leave him inside her log cabin and go outside the door to smoke. she usually washes her hands and face, but he still came home smoking of cigarettes. so i said that he shouldn't be smelling of cigarettes because she agreed she wouldn't smoke while looking after him. she said it won't happen again. next time i go to pick him up, he's upstairs in the flat with her roommate who smokes weed, and she's in the cabin fast asleep. i was very angry because i don't know her roommate. he's not a relative. he may be her friend but i don't know this man. i told my partner about this and he was livid. we wrote a very nicely worded text to her expressing our concerns and she threw a huge tantrum. saying she hasn't been smoking in his face, and other ridiculous things. we said that that doesn't matter. he's 6 weeks old, he's still delicate, and he comes home stinking of cigarettes and we have to wash all of his clothes and give him a bath to get rid of the smell. she's since apologised and says she understands now and it won't happen again . i don't want to cut ties because my partner and i both have experienced estranged family and we don't want that for our little one. the point is, i really need a break. my partner worked m-f 8-5, i'm exhausted, tired, and need some time to myself. but i don't know if i can trust mil again. i'm torn. my mum has made it clear that i can't keep pawning baby off every time i'm tired , my sisters have kids of their own, so mil would be the only one more than willing to have him overnight. i don't know what to do.

i cannot sleep when baby sleeps and i feel like im losing my mind	background im a 24 year old ftm and my lo is almost 2 months and i am ebf. he is up most every 2-3 hours during the night and takes naps during the day. sometimes hes up all day and night! i try to nap when he naps but i just cant fall asleep or i choose to do something else like laundry, shower, and/or make something to eat. this past week has been so difficult and my insomnia has been brought on so strong!!!! i was doing good and getting naps in and all the sudden this past week ive just fallen apart because i cant seem to sleep to make myself as priority as well. 	mightymouseem	/r/Mommit/comments/p6k0g8/i_cannot_sleep_when_baby_sleeps_and_i_feel_like/	44	21	0	0.96	1629260671.0
where to find babysitters without credit card payment?	im a ftm looking for a babysitter to watch my newborn infant. i have tried to use websites that are advertised specifically for finding babysitters but they require credit card payment to access them. i am willing to pay the monthly price and have the funds. its a personal choice as to why i dont have a credit card. i dont have a stable career and can sometimes go months without a job. credit cards require payment and that would drain my bank account. i wanted to get a debit card but the account would still need to be paid on as well. so i decided to avoid that until i find more stable work. idk what to do to other than ask my daughters dad. i have a feeling he wont be willing to pay the $41 for a months subscription. which is all we need because after that its daycare once shes 6 weeks. he just never mentions what hes willing to pay in support regarding our daughter leaving me to plan without having back up. if all else fails ill have to ask my mom and just pay her back.

how do people handle two kids? i feel like one is hard enough.	we have a 4 month old who has been fussy lately. background i started back at work 2.5 weeks ago and hes on paternity leave watching her during the day. but his idea of watching her includes letting her fuss while he applied for jobs and reads. i recent that he does this because i hate hearing her fussy unhappy noises to come out of the office to find him not actively trying to make her happy. sometimes its good because she needs a nap and will self soothe and fall asleep other times it just escalates. the real issue is last night i took her for an evening walk to hopefully have her fall asleep and to give him some alone time. i get a text from him right as i was getting back to the house thats hes upstairs resting. which i thought that meant hed come back down but he never did. i didnt ask if he was which he says i should have. im like why didnt you just say im beat and want to go to bed?! anyway i get her down early because of the bad naps and cant find the baby monitor im sweaty from the day and am just dying to take a shower. i wake him up and he says its in the nursery on the charger which is not a place we normally keep it. and an extra comment comes out of my mouth uncontrollably that he should have told me that he was going to bed. he tries to fight, i walk away to take a shower when i come to bed he says nasty things to get me to react i ignore him. then today at lunch i ask if he wants to talk about it he says sure. he insists i should have asked if he was coming back and i say he should have go even more context. my point is i would never leave him alone with our daughter without checking if thats ok. i couldnt get to that because as soon as i said going forward i will ask more follow up questions he stopped listening and thought he was completely in the right. what made it worse is my big mouth said as the fight continued even though i had tried to pause the convo but he kept pushing so i blurted out that i didnt want another kid with him. which is only something i think on really bad days when my daughter is awful or my husband and i cant work together. its less of a thought i have now that shes older but those first weeks were so hard. i cant imagine handling it well and having two kids. is it really easier once youve done it once before?	meranne	/r/Mommit/comments/p6vd9s/how_do_people_handle_two_kids_i_feel_like_one_is/	18	11	0	1.0	1629306120.0
hey mommas, can you help me?	my daughter will not eat any vegetables, no matter how i cook them. she inspects every speck of food i give her & will outright refuse the food made for her. she still struggles to hold a spoon correctly. it's resulted in a chicken fry, peanut butter sandwiches, and mootubes diet. she'll drink milk, sometimes apple juice, but she's picky about it as well as her favorite types of fruit snacks. she used to love bananas, but now she's picky about those too. she'll take a multi-vitamin and, newly, a pro-biotic, but she still only poops like once a week and only if i give her a suppository. she is easily distracted when it comes to putting her shoes on & get herself dressed, and picking up her toys. i am also concerned about her behaviors towards other people. when we say no and explain why she screams at us what she wants, then when we put her in time out, she'll hit us and scream louder. she does well at playtime with other kids, but when strangers say hi or she sees kids playing with something she wants, she'll scream. she will be in pre-school 5 days a week, 3 hours a day in september, hoping that helps.	drop_of_golden-sun	/r/Mommit/comments/p7193t/hey_mommas_can_you_help_me/	2	1	0	1.0	1629323976.0

i feel im the worst for wanting to brake me family apart but idk how to feel about this anymore.	i just dont know how to feel about this situation with my bf. i dont understand why he doesnt want to share financial details with me. we live together, have more than 3 years together, have a toddler and an arriving baby together. we have plans, a house, be more financially stabled etc. i dont work because of covid and i stay home taking care of my little baby. i have told him that due to him lying to me about stuff in the past i just want to feel more committed and secure in our relationship. i want to able to feel like i know how much money we have saved up and not only his money because i view this as a partnership not a one way thing. i let him know how much money i have in my bank account but he just doesnt tell me and also doesnt want me knowing his password for the bank. i have talked to him numerous times about this and when hes home and i tell him he gets mad at me and tells me i always want to make him angry or something and i just want to know if hes ever going to change that. he gets mad, leaves to his mothers house with our baby and just ignores me and then once he leaves to work he just tries to fix things over the phone. i dont ask for anything just more attention and commitment and i feel he just doesnt me to bother him about this stuff and it bothers me so much. this has been a repeated issue and i feel i dont know what to do anymore. he always makes me false promises. he also tells me when hes far away how he misses me how he wants to have sex but when hes here for a few weeks the frequency of sex is very little and when we argue he leaves and ignores me instead of talking about our problems 	jarettzyc	/r/Mommit/comments/p76rk7/i_feel_im_the_worst_for_wanting_to_brake_me/	5	3	0	0.71	1629343011.0
how do i politely ask my grandparents to stop making negative comments about my nb?	this is definitely a rant. i have a 10 week old nb . from the beginning there have been negative passive aggressive comments about her and how i raise her. i was raised to respect your elders which in my family translated to say nothing if youre upset. if it was just me, i dont even care, but now that its my baby its really pissing me off. they usually talk to her over facetime with my parents in the room and they say nothing even though ive expressed to them that its upsetting and i dont like it. for example tonight my mom said she just moved out of her nb clothes into 0-3s, and their response was oh well shes getting fat. shes 10 weeks old and not even 9lbs, shes anything but fat. the fact that shes growing is actually great and instead its met with negativity from them. i dont want them getting in the habit of calling her fat because as she grows thats all shes gonna hear from them and i want her to have a positive body image about herself as much as possible, i want to put a stop to it now. they also seem to think i hold her too much which is aggravating. shes my first and i brought her into this world, ill hold her all i want. i put her down for naps and sleep and whatnot, also when shes awake when im eating. shes just very alert and wants to be involved in everything, i only really hold her if shes up and i want to help her look around and see things. i also go back to work in a few weeks and just want to bond with her as much as possible, which again i consider to be a good thing that i want that. every single time they see her in person or on facetime it is guaranteed they say both of these things and im sick of it. so yeah, how do i nicely say shut it and let me do this how i want	DecentConfusion4815	/r/Mommit/comments/p76rqu/how_do_i_politely_ask_my_grandparentsnb_great/	45	113	0	0.98	1629343030.0
update how do i holiday with childfree friends - it went as badly as i thought it would.	1. they wouldn't sleep passed 5 30am so one of us ended up driving them around until light/7am. it is was me then i'd go for breakfast somewhere with them because, 2. everyone kept quiet until everyone was awake at 9am - which goes as well as expected with a toddler. 3. felt like no one was interested in talking with me if i had my baby with me. 4. people didn't consider baby life ie, if they lost track of time and weren't going to be able to meet us for dinner or breakfast like planned. i tried to set a few guidelines and explain what they'd be like, but it was a few days before everyone felt comfortable with them around. with various levels of interest that ranged from complete ignoring to carrying them around and distract them whilst i cooked. it was upsetting and hard and even when i tried to explain it to one of them who didn't understand why i didn't want to come to the next holiday, it didn't feel like things got better. we left two days early, my partner had no energy and we had a fight when we got home about division of care and things. i'm crying now. they've already planned another one next february and i've declared well stay a few nights without lo then i'll go home with them. i feel so disconnected from my friends now and i'm so upset. i don't know why i expected them to understand and i don't understand why my partner thought it would be a holiday. i don't know why i wrote this out, but i guess i wanted to let everyone know. thank you for all your advice, i should have listened to my gut and stay home.	doryshotgun	/r/Mommit/comments/p7eo6r/update_how_do_i_holiday_with_childfree_friends_it/	22	85	0	0.97	1629379069.0

i need cloth diaper help!!! please help!	i bought my son cloth diapers when i was pregnant i really wanted to use them as our primary but our washing machine broke and can't do a soak cycle or run hot water and when the repairman came to fix it he said there was no problem with it as it could run a load on one single setting. this wasn't a problem at first with the lovely water soluble poops, but as he stated eating real food i just gave up. i use them occasionally still when he needs a change close to bed time. we have the simple being diapers from amazon. i don't hate them, but i'm definitely not in love. they aren't as absorbent as what he needs sometimes even when changing atleast every 2 hours regardless of how much pee there was. they come with microfiber inserts and i have some cotton prefolds i could layer in. i've yet to try that yet. they also came with rolls of what looks like maybe dry wipes to make wipes with or possibly liners. i really don't know what they are. i love the idea of using liners though especially with the poops he has now. i've been eyeing up lighthouse kids diapers liners and their heavy wetter inserts and their supreme all in one's. i'm afraid they're over hyped instagra cute diapers though. i like the idea of the tummy panel, but idk if it's actually effective and their claim of a dry and wet side of the insert for potty training. i think i can make the simple being diapers work for our daytime diapers with better inserts changing atleast every 2 hours with liners for poop and for overnight diapers i need all the help i can get. my son pees a lot all at once. he is not a trickler. i probably need the most heavy duty super soaker inserts i can get that will keep him dry with how easily he gets diaper rash as well. he's a he has to have diaper rash cream with every change baby in huggies little movers and overnight diapers right now. also as far as fit he's a long more on the skinny side baby. he's got chunky thighs though. he is 32 inches long and 21 pounds.	howdoimom2020	/r/Mommit/comments/p9fv6s/i_need_cloth_diaper_help_please_help/	12	1	0	0.67	1629650583.0

my toddler is very clingy and needy after getting over a cold, how do i get him used to his normal routine?	about 6 days ago, my toddler came down with a fever and was stuffy and lethargic. naturally, i did everything i could to make sure he was comfortable and his cold was well cared for, and his pediatrician confirmed it was a minor cold, not covid so it cleared up quick. it's been a few days since the fever and ickiness let up and he's back to his normal energetic self... well, almost back to normal. he's suddenly very clingy and possessive over me, not even allowing his daddy to hug me without throwing a tantrum and screams like mad when i try to leave his side for even a second. he's regressed back to expecting me to spoon feed him and hold his cups and sippies for him, refuses to sleep in his own bed, and is incredibly impatient about everything. i made the mistake of coddling him while he was sick and doing everything for him until he got over his fever. but now that he's better, i've been trying to get us back into his normal routine and level of independence. how do i better help him get back into normal routine, or if that's not entirely possible, how do i not lose my cool with the fussing and demandingness? i'd give him a few minutes to his dad or let him have some supervised alone time but he absolutely melts down when i take a step away. it breaks my heart but lord, does it test my patience.	grimoire_wine	/r/Mommit/comments/p9o25e/my_toddler_2_yo_is_very_clingy_and_needy_after/	2	1	0	0.67	1629676846.0

please help	my 9yo daughter is an insufferable bratbut not to us. i mean, she has the usual preteen angst in the form of eye rolls when you ask her to do things sometimes, but generally she understands that what we say goes. she gets her chores done, she helps around the house, and she can be a real pleasure to be around. now when it comes to coaches, teachers, grandparents, aunts/uncles, basically any adult who isnt us, she is a f@/&ing nightmare. ill preface by saying she begged for horse lessons, begged to be apart of cheer, and after 3 lessons, her horse trainer asked that we find a different barn because her attitude is so bad. sd9 had no complaints about the trainer, in fact, if you asked her she says she had fun! we have gotten very similar feedback from daycare teachers, school teachers, babysitters, etc. so it isnt a one off. she has no problem telling her teacher that she isnt the boss of her, even though we have reiterated multiple times that she is in fact the boss of her. until now, i always thought people with bratty kids were lazy, permissive parents who didnt set boundaries; that is not the case with us! we have a regular routine that we follow, she has expectations that are very consistent, and we essentially have a zero tolerance policy for talking back/bad attitudes at home. we have shown support for teachers when we get a negative report but a punishment at home seems to be forgotten the second she goes back into the school setting. i also was under the impression that kids are typically great for strangers and save their worst behavior for home, has anyone experienced the opposite? i am so tired of being embarrassed and having the same talk with her over and over again about needing to respect adults. she claims she has very little control over what comes out of her mouth and always has an excuse for why her bad attitude was justified . i am now hesitant to sign her up for any activities or leave her with family to babysit ever because they always have such negative reports. she has been to therapy/counseling for a year straight, it did nothing. they said she suffered from low level general anxiety and thats it. please please help!	aaaavvvvaaaa	/r/Mommit/comments/p9qv8j/please_help/	8	6	0	0.88	1629687087.0

dont laugh but how does diaper cream really work?	you think i would know since this is my second baby but im lost over here with my daughter... with my first not one diaper cream worked for him! my grandmom told me to stop wasting money on them and just use cornstarch and it was a game changer. all i do is wipe his butt with huggies natural wipes, then dry the entire area with a clean soft tissue and sprinkle some corn starch on his cute little butt. worked like magic and he only had 1-2 more diaper rashes after that i believe. with my daughter that trick isnt working and i feel so bad! plus im worried about the corn starch getting to close to her lady bits and causing a uti idk why but i have so much anxiety when it comes to keeping her clean! you think id be a pro at this having my own vagina and all anyway, im gona be going to the store later and figured id grab a couple different diaper rash creams for her. the thing is how do you actually use them tho? just apply the cream on her clean dry butt? do you have totally wipe all the cream off at her next diaper change? shes 3 weeks old and nursing all the time so shes pooping all the time too lol. i feel like its counterproductive to put cream on her butt just to have to wipe more stuff off her butt and cause the rash to get worst. i dont wipe excessively to try and prevent the rash from happening on the first place and sometimes if its just a little poop ill just use a clean tissue to get off. what do you guys do with diaper changes after cream has been applied? thank you in advance!	derpality	/r/Mommit/comments/p9zopo/dont_laugh_but_how_does_diaper_cream_really_work/	48	17	0	0.91	1629724817.0

how do not feel depressed at home all day with toddlers?	maybe i have undiagnosed depression. and i am looking to go to therapy to discuss my issues. as of now i'm temporarily not working but will be returning to work next month. when i'm at home with my 2 toddlers i feel...sad. i wish i had more company throughout the day, but my husband leaves for work early and my older daughter goes to school. so i'm home always feeling alone. talking to my babies is fun but draining to do all day. when i wake up i feel sad some days that i don't have anything to do or anyone to talk to. do you moms ever feel this way? edit thank you for all the meaningful advice. this is a wonderful community and i'm glad i came here for support.	pwa09	/r/Mommit/comments/pao9my/how_do_not_feel_depressed_at_home_all_day_with/	43	49	0	0.96	1629814739.0

how to deal with a 5 year old suddenly worried about the concept of death?	i was reading my daughter her bed time story when suddenly she started crying and saying she doesn't want me to die. this was quite unexpected, as we've not had a death in the family or anything and she was quite overwhelmed with emotion. i just hugged her and told her that we i had a very very long life ahead of me and i was always going to be with her no matter what. however, i felt unprepared and also like this didn't really reassure her much. she just cuddled me until she went to sleep, but she was still very upset. &; i was wondering how anyone might have dealt with this before, and how i can be a bit more prepared with a better answer next time if she asks. &; thanks	macadeliiiiic	/r/Mommit/comments/pauvkf/how_to_deal_with_a_5_year_old_suddenly_worried/	4	9	0	1.0	1629834819.0
potty training advice needed!	my kiddo is a little over 2 and regularly refuses to use the potty. he knows how, and on the off chance you can convince him to go he does super well with it, but it's a screaming and kicking fest about 75% of the time. i've tried everything from asking nicely or asserting, offering a million different bribes, showing him real underwear and letting him try them on, potty songs, using a timer, to just picking him up and placing him there and insisting, and yet he still would rather stare you in the eye while going red in the face from pooping and vehemently denying he needs to go the entire time. the only other thing i know to do is wait a while and come back to it later, but he's a really smart kid and is capable of having been fully potty trained at this point if he'd only be willing to go. i also am so over diapers and as we're trying for our second i'd like at least a little reprieve before we launch into the whole cycle again. anyone else have a super stubborn lo that they struggled getting trained? any advice would be amazing. thanks everyone!	4everspokenfor	/r/Mommit/comments/paxys5/potty_training_advice_needed/	8	1	0	1.0	1629844337.0

seeking advice from moms who are good at making mom friends, cause i suck at it. feeling like an outcast today.	my husband took our son to baseball practice tonight, and he said two different moms initiated conversations with him. i asked him how the conversations went, and he said they asked him questions about his job, my job, the kids ages etc. normal small talk. i feel really left out. the other moms on the team never initiate conversation with me. it hurts, and it makes me feel like others see him as friendly and warm, and im seen as cold and unapproachable. its been a rough day anyway, and i started crying when he told me. if you are good at making mom friends, how do you do it?! and why are they only talking to my husband and not me? i would never.	arudegala	/r/Mommit/comments/pbpi5w/seeking_advice_from_moms_who_are_good_at_making/	33	98	0	0.99	1629942150.0
my daughter is going through some very heavy emotional changes and could i could use some advice.	hi there. first post here and i was and still am very hesitant to talk about what i need to. but i really think some other moms may be able to help me through this one. i do apologize ahead of time if this gets too long but i really feel the details here were very important on how she came to the conclusion that she did. my beautiful daughter is 10 years old but she has always been a little more advanced than the other girls her age. she is extremely smart, loving, caring and has one of the biggest hearts of anyone that i have ever met in my life. she has also been a little more emotionally mature and gets very attached to the people she loves. a few days before her 10th birthday, she got her period for the first time. she totally knew it was coming because the changes were definitely happening and we had a ton of talks about it. she was actually a little happy when she got it? maybe not happy but kind of excited that she got it before her friends. she was especially excited to tell her best friend that she talks to all the time. like these two were inseparable and i was perfectly okay with it. they talked on messenger kids all the time and had sleepovers. a few weeks after her 10th birthday she asked if we could talk. she said her friend wasn't talking to her like she usually does. she said she wouldn't video chat with her which was not like her at all because they did this whenever they weren't together. all she was getting back was little one word answers. she actually got very emotional about it. i just held her why she cried and she asked why she didn't like her anymore and why she wasn't good enough. i was heartbroken that she was hurting this way. and that was when she told me that she was pretty sure she liked her more than a friend, that she loved her. i explained to her that that was perfectly okay. i am married to a man but i had explained to her that i was the same way. i did too in fact find myself attracted to other girls. this really comforted her. things actually got better after this talk. her and her friend started talking again , and she found a way to get to google at her friends house and did a little research for herself. nothing bad at all but did come to the conclusion that she believed that she was what she read as pansexual . i looked it up and it said that it was basically known to be gender blind and love anyone not for their gender, but for who they really are on the inside. this made a lot of sense to me because she does have such a big beautiful heart and telling me that she believes that she felt this way, made my heart feel full. it made me sort of see where she was coming from because she always made so many friends and always got extremely close to them. so i guess what i am wondering, is have any other moms had their children come out at such a young age? i am 100% for her loving whoever she loves as long as that person makes her happy. she knows that i love her no matter what. i was also just wondering if anyone has experience with either being pansexual or knowing someone who is. i am definitely just more open to wanting to know more about it and how it is different than being bisexual, which she thought she was at first. i mean no offense to anyone who is either pan or bi as i am bi myself. thank you all in advance!

is anyone else having hard time with school? 	back story ive been a stay at home since my daughter was smaller shes never been to daycares & no one unfamiliar has ever watched her & sorry for long post she been in school for a week & a day and every single day she has cried with going to school, she doesnt want me to leave her. with covid they arent allowing parents inside of the school. first day i went to the office and teacher got her she did fine. the rest of the days she has to go by herself. everyday i walk her to the front and she screams so teachers help take her to her classroom. ive asked her and there is no issues at school its just she doesnt wanna be left alone. ive boosted her up every single morning & night before she goes to bed, the mornings are calm we have a routine before school too. its getting to the point where 2 or 3 teachers have to help her her inside. it breaks my heart because i remember when i was little and it happened to me i dont want her to feel upset and alone. i remind her each day i will be back to get her and it will only be for a little while. im so stuck on what to do. if i pull her out of pre - k i think starting kindergarten will be the same way & more harder because now she thinks if she does this will get out again, but doing this to her doesnt feel right with me. im lost and i need some sort of advice on what i can do better.

would it be wrong of me to ask my friend to bring her own toys for her daughter to use when she visits?	sorry of this is long, i just want some input. my best friend katy has a little daughter named sydney. sydney is not quite a year older than my son. because of this, they are in different stages developmentally. sydney is walking/running around, and my son is just starting to crawl. katy and i have been good friends since high school and still try to get together frequently, so we try to do play dates together with our kids 2-3 times a month. the days that i've been hosting these play dates have become increasingly stressful for me, as they take a lot of prep. because sydney is a toddler, and my son is only just now starting to crawl, i have to do a far more thorough baby proofing of my house. removing things from table tops, window sills, etc. the biggest issue that i have it is that sydney tends to be destructive when she plays; smashing things together/against the floor, tearing up books, etc. last month while i was out of the room changing my son, she ripped up one of his books so badly that i had to throw it away. lately when katy is planning on coming for a visit, i tend to pack away all of my sons books and his nicer toys, and only leave out things like rings, big legos, and blocks that are easy to clean and not easy to damage. i feel bad about this as it means there is not a huge variety for sydney to play with. and i have plenty of toys that are more geared towards her age/stage of development but i don't really want to bring them out because i don't want them damaged before my son has had a chance to use them. would it be rude of me to request that my friend bring her own toys for sydney to play with when she comes to visit? am i being too uptight about this? my son is my only child, so i have not yet experienced the toddler stage myself.

am i the mean mom who cancels disney?	im a newbie here, so i hope this is a good place for me to post this. earlier this summer when things were looking up with respect to covid, i made plans to take my 2.5 year old son to disney with my husband and in laws the first week of october. im also pregnant, so the hope was for this to be a very special vacation focused on my son. and now, well, you know. florida is basically the covid capital of the world. were all vaccinated except for my dear son. we already canceled a vacation with my in laws last year. theyre all pretty reasonable people and have been taking covid seriously enough, but i think im the only one thinking about canceling. im due the first week of december, so we can reschedule, but not until after the baby is born, and realistically, i wouldnt take an infant to disney anyway, so we wouldnt reschedule for a long time. my son is old enough now that he understands the vacation plans and is excited. i feel like this sounds dramatic, but this is such a hard decision. i dont know how much longer i should wait it out before making a decision. am i really going to have to be the mean mom who cancels disney?	bethanasty	/r/Mommit/comments/pcecal/am_i_the_mean_mom_who_cancels_disney/	28	10	0	0.92	1630031741.0

what do i do about this little girl i babysit? breaks my heart.	i dont know if this is even the right place to post this and sorry its long and maybe all over the place im a bit emotional. so ive been watching this little girl for over a year, maybe even closer to 2. shes wonderful, smart, fits in well with my other children. here recently ive been worrying about her. well not so much her as her mother. so far out of 24 days her mom has had her 4 of those days. nights included she will drop her off on monday and not come and get her until saturday and even then once every other week she will ask that i keep her saturday night as well so she can go and do something . so 4 nights and days with her mom and 20 nights and days with me just for this month since she started working again. her hours are 4-11pm so its not an all day shift or anything. there are some things ive noticed. last year i had this girl for every holiday. valentines day i had to cancel plans with my husband so she could go out, easter she was here and i got her a basket, 4th of july she watched fireworks with us, halloween we took her trick or treating, christmas eve and christmas day she woke up at my house, new years. her mom is very open that she loves to party, smoke weed, drink, do other recreational drugs . now i normally have nothing against that. except when it comes to children being exposed and possibly neglected because of the use. this little girl is almost 4. was still sucking a binky which i took away with no problems. her mom would bring her back with one in her mouth for months and i kept telling her she never even asks for it while shes here. finally that stopped. then i recently potty trained her, again super easy and she caught on quick and loved wearing big girl underwear which i took her out and bought. yet again her mom brings her in a diaper every time. she told me she wanted to get her potty trained so she could start school. i did that for her. no accidents and she keeps putting her in diapers. ive noticed also that this little girl will not get out of bed when she wakes up. she will lay there in complete silence waiting for someone to come get her. she peed all over herself this morning and just laid in bed crying i then gave her a hug and told her she must have peed in her sleep and thats fine. she said shes been awake since my oldest went to school. 2 hours earlier! i asked why she didnt get up and come to the potty. she said mommy will get mad at me if i get out of my bed if she doesnt come get me she will whoop my butt. this made me obviously uncomfortable. i have never known a child to just lay in bed in their own urine and cry instead of getting up to come get someone. let alone when they wake up not come out and see if anyone else is awake or at least play with some toys in that room. how long does this girl lay in bed at home staring at the ceiling. how do you even get a child to do that? i had to excuse myself to cry in the laundry room. then i got angry. what mother leaves her child like this. she cries so hard when she gets dropped off and its not because she doesnt like it here. she loves it. she tells me she loves me all the time and has friends and we always have fun things to do every single day. i think shes crying and full of anxiety because when she comes here she never knows how long shes going to stay and she misses her mommy! her mom still sends her bag full of legit baby food and baby puff snacks. that i never give her because she loves the food i cook everyday and has no problems eating real food. her clothes smell bad that she sends and i always wash them. shes filthy when shes dropped off and if i run my fingers through her hair it feels like sand on her scalp theres so much dirt. i cant help but think what is her home life like? and just cry harder. i need advice. what do i do.	thefirstofeverything	/r/Mommit/comments/pcvv8i/what_do_i_do_about_this_little_girl_i_babysit/	154	674	0	0.99	1630097595.0

what do you do when you just feel like crap about your postpartum body ?	all it took was one bad angle of me looking at myself in the mirror and my day feels ruined. i just went rabbit hole on instagram searching of tummy tucks before and after pics . its not the weight for me im still carrying 10 pounds more or less from the baby weight which i dont think is bad considering my chest grew like four cup sizes and im still breastfeeding. its just the loose skin the way in crinkles and fold on to itself the way. the pouch that overhangs i just hate the way it looks. im just replaying every negative comment ive heard in the last year about how big my belly was during pregnancy and how it looked like i was carrying multiples, and even postpartum after i made a mom friend she saw my belly after coming back from working out she had said she hoped that i was working out to get rid of my belly because that was going to require surgery. but none the less i just feel like crap and wish i could have my pre pregnancy tummy and boobs back.	snakelakecake	/r/Mommit/comments/pdh1nx/what_do_you_do_when_you_just_feel_like_crap_about/	15	17	0	0.96	1630181719.0

advice needed mil saying be careful he doesnt get fat - about our 6 month old baby 	we have a 6 month old son who has recently started eating solids . my mil is very traditional / old school and sometimes gives well meaning but outdated parenting advice. one of the things was her asking constantly when we would start our son on solids . our son was unwell when he was born but i was keen to keep to guidelines and start when he showed signs of being ready so we started at 5.5 months. he is keen on eating and i offer him healthy, home cooked foods. i have done all the research about what to feed him - no processed food / salt / sugar etc. mil has seen him eat a few times and hell feed himself avocado on a strip of toast and gobble down some yoghurt etc. she has now said on 3 occasions oh he likes his food, careful he doesnt get fat. this makes me really angry. i think its an extremely unhealthy attitude to have towards a 6 month old baby, obviously she has some underlying eating based issues . the first time i said he is 6 months he needs food to grow and thrive. the second time other people were around and i didnt get the chance to say anything . the 3rd time i overheard her saying it to my husband whilst he was feeding our son. im also upset about it as our son lost weight after he was born due to illness and he is thriving now but in absolutely no way overweight . if anything hes a little light for his length so i want to say something. i was thinking of waiting until she next says it then tell her that i dont want her discussing weight or fatness in-front of my son. she is quite sensitive. my husband agrees but generally just counters what she says whilst i want to nip it in the bud now. what do you all recommend? sorry for the long post! thanks in advance	Leap_Quantum123	/r/Mommit/comments/peoi17/advice_needed_mil_saying_be_careful_he_doesnt_get/	42	130	0	0.98	1630349510.0

post csection tummy looks like an upside down volcano when i do plank.	kind of says it in my title. i lost quite a bit of weight and skinner than prepregnancy. i felt disgusted when i saw how my tummy looked when i was in a plank position. such a new perspective. ive been doing cardio along with strength training and today i only had my sports bra and runner shorts on . and when i was in a high plank position , my tummy was so ugly and disgusting. it was seriously like an upside down volcano where the bellybutton area seems hollow and then the skin/fat surrounding it was just drooping. even when i try to suck in my tummy, couldnt get it to flatten out. when i went to feel it, it felt just like skin. when standing up, seems fine. i do still have a pooch when i sit. is that from the stretching? will i be able to make that disappear? i took some pictures but the angle cant really show how bad it is.

how often do you see grandparents?	im just looking for some general opinions/advice. i recently got into a huge fight with my husband because his parents havent seen our kids since last month. this is mainly because we were on vacation at the beginning of this month and unfortunately weve all been sick for the last week and a half , so we havent had visitors. both of our parents live 45 min-1 hour away and we typically see them both at different times twice a month or so. both sets of parents are pretty good about watching the kids if we have plans or want to go somewhere for the weekend. im obviously really grateful for this, but lately his parents have started becoming somewhat aggressive about demanding more time. they were going to just stop by this weekend, and i obviously said no because my youngest was still super sick and our house was a wreck. my father in law also has some major health issues, he almost died when he had covid last year, so i definitely dont want to expose them to any illness. my husband is now upset with me and is accusing me of being greedy by not allowing his parents to have more time with the kids. personally, i think he would be fine with dropping them off there every single weekend, and while i do really appreciate when theyre able to watch them, i also like doing stuff with my kids on the weekend and i have no desire to send them away every weekend. we both work full-time, so weekends are special. i will admit that i dont want company every single weekend either, or spend every single weekend driving back and forth between our parents houses. were not really the types who do sunday dinner every week; im not close at all to my parents, but theyre better grandparents than they were parents to me, so we still have a relationship. i have a good relationship with my in-laws, but they can be irritating, particularly my mother in law, and every time they do come over, my husband will typically disappear with his dad and start working on some project, and i get stuck watching judge shows on tv with his mom. am i being unreasonable here?

thinking about asking everyone who visits my daughter to wear a mask again.	covid is ramping up in our area again and im beginning to feel on edge. i had become slack with the whole mask this for a short while because cases were down to a low we hadnt seen since the beginning of the pandemic but since they lifted the mask mandates cases have been rising steadily and are almost where they were last november during cold a flu season which was the second worst high weve seen. mostly everyone in our circle is vaccinated but even vaccinated people are catching the virus and one or two are not vaccinated. am i over reacting wanting everyone to wear masks around my 4mo old? im contemplating telling the few who are un vaxed they cant see her until things settle down or if they choose to get vaxed then if they also wear a mask. one of these people is my sister who has a lot of anxiety and is a self proclaimed hypochondriac, i feel terrible because shes goi through a rough time mentally feeling unsure of the vaccine and state of the world. i hate the idea of telling her she cant see her niece, aside from me shes my daughter favourite person, but id never forgive myself if i didnt protect my baby well enough and she got sick. thoughts? i feel like i know what i want to do but i feel torn because of how i know other people will react and feel, but my intuition tells me its not about them its about your baby.

how in the world do you guys manage households and a toddler? how do you divide household chores fairly? i'm so tired 	upon my return from my weekly grocery store trip, three heavy bags hanging from my shoulders, my husband - sitting on our couch with our toddler watching tv - let me know that he had put on a load of laundry with our toddler's bibs and reusable face wipes. i was tired and pissed off after a day of toddler herding, cleaning, working during naptime and maskless idiots at the store so i said did you put anything else in with it? because what he put in doesn't even make a third of a load and our hampers are overflowing. he let me know that he was doing me a favor and i'm welcome, he won't help me again. so now i'm sitting here and wondering where we went wrong and how we started going down this road of me being responsible for every.last.bit of housework, while i stay home with our kid and freelance during naps, at night and on weekends. i bear all the mental load to boot, i do taxes, doctor's appointments, meal plans, financial planning, i even swap out the damn toothbrushes when it's time. so please, moms and parents, how are you dividing up your household responsibilities? how can i transfer some of this crushing mental load? i'm particularly interested in arrangements with a sahparent or one of the spouses/partners working part-time, but am so grateful for all your experiences!	nafhere	/r/Mommit/comments/pgpluv/how_in_the_world_do_you_guys_manage_households/	121	139	0	1.0	1630613162.0

baby came early and i still dont know what stroller to buy	so i have two kids. one is 4 and hates walking. the other is a newborn that came early. before s was born i was trying to figure out what stroller to get, but he came before i ever resolved the issue. now im scrambling trying to figure out what i need. before s was born, i often brought the stroller on outings to either use as a shopping cart to put my heavy backpack in and fill with our stuff, or for d to ride in since she gets tired of walking very quickly. right now we have an old baby jogger city mini gt, and i love it. but now that i have s, id like to have somewhere to place the baby too. i plan on baby wearing most of the time, but its nice to have somewhere to put the baby down when you get tired. my problem is that i dont want a massive double stroller, but i know that realistically i cant expect the four year old to walk as far or fast as i do. in fact, i dont think i want a double stroller at all, except that i doubt a standing board will be enough for d. i think she needs a spot to sit. id also really like to have a stroller that folds easily without much fuss to get on and off of buses, etc, without having to deconstruct the whole thing each time. so basically i was really hoping to get suggestions from all you mamas. is there a stroller you love for two kids that isnt too big? it can be a single stroller that has a seat big enough for two to squeeze into, or it can be a double stroller thats not too big and folds easily. or it can be something with an attachment like a bench seat for d. all ideas welcome! thanks in advance.

i dont even know where to start.	sorry for the wall of text. i just need to vent. so our youngest is currently getting over a cold and my husband decided to take him and his older brother to see his grandparents. i was initially not ok with it, but he seemed to be feeling better so i said sure. i was thinking they would just be hanging out inside where its cool and come back in a couple of hours. this was not the case. my husband decides theyre going to get in the pool. again im like uh thats probably not the best idea. but what do i know right? so 3 hours later of them being outside in the heat, not eating lunch, and my toddler not having a proper nap they come back. i realize at this point my oldest hasnt drank any of his water. i ask why and he says because it got warm. ok sure. so then i question why my husband didnt have him get something else to drink or even bring up him needing to stay hydrated while theyre outside. he replies with its not my responsibility. now im just furious at this point. first you take our still congested toddler out and wear him out now youre trying to tell me its not your responsibility to make sure our oldest had something to drink??? i am seriously so upset at this point and if course as soon as i start pointing out how irresponsible he was being he immediately starts calling me rude and saying that i should have been there i guess he just cant manage things unless im around? it almost feels like hes blaming me for his own shortcomings. how would you react in this situation? i dont even want to see his face im so frustrated.	sweetthins	/r/Mommit/comments/pi10oa/i_dont_even_know_where_to_start/	19	30	0	0.86	1630794311.0
covid mommas - how did you handle visitors?	ive just been given a delivery date for my second baby and im trying to wrap my head around how i want to manage this. i have quite a supportive, respectful family who will ultimately do what theyre told - but there are a couple of people who will feel hurt if they dont get to meet the baby in the hospital. current restrictions in our area are that two people can visit a day, but they cant switch out. i have a pain condition that will almost definitely flare when the baby comes and this delivery will be a c-section, so my thinking is basically that the two visitors need to be people who are there to help me, not who are there to visit the baby. that means basically just my mom and husband until we come home. the problem is, to everyone who gets left out, its going to feel like my mom is getting special treatment and a head start on grand-parenting. in an ideal world, id rather not kick things off by upsetting most of my broader support network, but i dont want to miss out on having a helper in favor of entertaining, if that makes sense. at the end of the day i guess id rather hurt peoples feelings than put my health last but i was wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and whether you came up with some kind of solution i havent thought of.

this is a little lengthy, but i need mil and boundary advice desperately	i do not consent for the following to be shared anywhere. im overwhelmed and exhausted with my mil and just need to vent and get some advice. my husband and i just had our first child two months ago. first grand child on both sides. for background, my husband and i have known each other since we were in 3rd grade so our families are close and we all know each other very well and get along. not a typical situation. my in laws live on the west coast and we are in the midwest. about a 20 hour drive. when they came out, they stayed with my parents who live about 15 minutes from me. tldr how do i set boundaries with my mil and preserve my mental health when i feel like shes sucking me dry while still letting her build a relationship with her only grandchild? so my in laws drove out and stayed for 6 weeks when the baby was born. i know, thats crazy and why did i agree, i was not involved in the planning due to a hard pregnancy and my husband just genuinely didnt think it through. his mom is very pushy and basically just told him the plan. they were here 3 weeks before birth and 3 after. they did make themselves useful in the time pre-baby. my fil replaced our kitchen flooring and helped my parents install new kitchen cabinets to earn their keep. two days before the baby was born, my husband and i gathered both families to set rules and expectations for when the baby was born. they were what you would think would be common sense but we just wanted to be clear dont kiss the baby, wash your hands, dont come over unannounced, keep visits less than a couple hours to allow us family bonding time, ask permission before holding baby well, we didnt even get halfway through the list before she stood up and yelled well then we might as well just go home now then! and stormed off crying and slamming doors. so that was how we started this mess. then, we had a semi urgent induction for low amniotic fluids which went wonderfully, but was still exhausting and difficult. my baby was dealing with typical baby things and my husband and i were completely and totally exhausted. my mil used this to her advantage. she was a labor and delivery nurse before retirement so she would come over and help but also ignored basic safety things like dont use a blanket with baby and dont fall asleep with baby on you. she showed up at our door completely unannounced at least 3 times. every time i took baby upstairs and was asleep so she didnt see her because i dont reward bad behavior. she was at my house for 9 hours some days while my husband worked and wouldnt leave and was hogging my newborn. i only got her back to nurse her then shed pretty much snatch her away. i was too tired to fight and just cried to my husband when he got home. then there was the kissing. the other night i had a dream that mil kissed her on the face and baby got rsv and died. because mil keeps going on and on about how she cant wait to kiss the baby. things like that cheek is begging for a kiss from gams. she kissed her multiple times when she was out here despite us telling her not to. first couple were truly accidental. then she started justifying with just on the head and crap. we told her off but it didnt stop. my parents havent kissed her despite seeing her way way more. to try to wrap this up, now my mil pretty much demands daily pics and updates and videos and weekly facetimes and phone calls. my husband and i each have special nicknames for my baby and i broke down sobbing yesterday when mil texts me hows my moms special nickname doing today? i feel like shes intentionally trying to compete with me to my baby. shes dominating our family photo album with comments about her being gams baby and smiling for her gams and saying she cant wait to kiss babys face. her next trip is in 2 months and i have so much anxiety i feel sick. any advice is much appreciated. i feel like im spending precious baby time trying to manage her and im so done but also want to keep the peace and not destroy our relationship.	thecurioushedgehog	/r/Mommit/comments/pi78qu/this_is_a_little_lengthy_but_i_need_mil_and/	7	5	0	0.86	1630820002.0

 i'll take the baby if you want 	small vent. that statement drives me bonkers, even if it's meant with the right intentions. husband and i live in a multi generational home with my parents, their idea when we shared the news of our first pregnancy amid the pandemic crazy, not to mention we've been supplementing the home income as we've worked the entire pandemic. i'm on maternity leave until baby's 2 month shots, dh works ft and only had 2 weeks off fmla, so minimal buffering when he's not home. this is the first grandbaby on my side of the family, baby is 6 weeks and without fail, my mom likes to yell from the other room, over my crying infant that she will take the baby . this strikes a nerve every. single. time. why's my baby crying you ask? oh? because he just woke up, he's hungry, his diaper needs changed. or the number 1 culprit, i'm currently trying to get my milk supply up by trying to bfe, and he's pissed off that there's not more milk in my boob, so he's screaming at me to feed him more boob juice while i quickly make a bottle of formula. when i'm told, i'll take the baby what i actually hear is, you're obviously doing whatever you're doing wrong and i can do it better . it doesn't help that literally any time my mom offers up her unsolicited advice, it begins with some form of her stating her 30 year/i've raised 3 children experience, first. right down to her getting mad at me when i tell her no to something i don't want done to my child because either the pediatrician said x is unnecessary, or my knowledge base is more up to date on the subject matter. when i do allow her to take the baby, she always makes some undermining comment to the baby... about me... this isn't grandma's first rodeo! grandma knows exactly what you need! and when i call her on it, she has the audacity to tell me she was joking and i'm over reacting. stab me in the eye with a spoon i'm not an insufferable know it all by any means, but there's a reason why my number 1 source of parenting material isn't my mom. i love my mom, i appreciate her being part of the village , but yoooo. baby is only 6 weeks old and i don't want to resent my mom for this crap.	samelioration	/r/Mommit/comments/pimjhy/ill_take_the_baby_if_you_want/	20	33	0	0.97	1630880016.0
how do i get my husband, love of my life and my partner, to truly listen and absorb what im trying to tell him?	my kids are in school/camp/day care. my husband and i each work full time. i now work from home due to covid and probably will as long as i work for this company. i bring in more money , plus our health benefits. . my husband has a physically taxing job though, with no health insurance benefits available. we used to split household duties well but ive always been the default parent. now that i work from home its natural that my duties have changed, thats okay. the problem is that i kept all of my old half, plus now taken on more. i do almost all of the kid pickups/dropoffs since they are in town, do the morning cleaning . this results in me also doing most of the morning routine . i ask for help, i beg for help. ive broken down crying and said i cant keep doing it all. ive confessed that nothing is fun anymore and life is just a routine; ive told him i think im depressed since im always at home, alone most of the day, and giving my all to everyone else. i dont get enjoyment out of what i used to. last time it turned in to a real argument like weve never had before. it was a weekday morning but for some reason he wasnt going in to work until later . i was tired and i told him i need help and cant do all the parenting. he yelled like he has never done before. im so sick of hearing you say that!, said he does so much for the family, and he left the house to go buy a coffee . on the way out he kicked a bucket of our kids toys. i texted him and told him to calm down before he came back because he scared the kids and me. ive never seen him so angry and on the edge of violence. i was serious and reassuring, saying take all the time you need, then well talk when we both more calm he was calmer when he came home but didnt apologize for yelling, didnt apologize for scaring me and the kids. he said hell try to do more but i need to realize that he does a lot too and he works hard, then listed everything he does . i think he thinks i have an easy job because i sit in front of a computer all day so i should do more. ive never pondered divorce before but the thought crossed my mind. ive been the breadwinner and default parent for 10 years. im afraid its never going to change and im going to resent him to the point where when our kids leave, we have forgotten who each of us and each other are. i love him, i love who he is. i love who we are when were together and not stressed. hes my best friend, we have fun together when we have time to just play and be us. we do not work well together under stress. other than therapy , do you have any suggestions? even some comradery would help me feel less alone!

i just want a call.	my husband is away on a company team event this long weekend. its a much long overdue holiday for him. at first i was against the idea simply due to covid and risk for our 15 month baby. i later agreed thinking we cant live in a bubble forever and hes been quite cautious since he cant work remote. i asked him to take a rapid covid screening test the day he returns and he agreed fast forward to the long weekend and i called the pharmacy again to make sure we can take the screening test. was then told they dont book appointments on holiday and walk ins might not be served. i located another pharmacy & it wasnt much of a big deal although i did panic for a few minutes after the lady told me i might not be able to get any bookings because of the long weekend. i gave him a call & briefly talked about location and timing. i could feel he totally forgot about covid test and i felt upset. disturbed. at that moment, i felt mentally drained. like why do i need to initiate these things, why am i the one calling different locations to book his appointment. i asked myself whether he puts anything to heart. why do i constantly have to send reminders? its stressful for me because i need to keep reminding myself to remind him - if that makes sense? comes night time and no call from him. so i called him around 9pm hoping to get a quick video chat so our daughter can see him before she goes to bed. he said hes out with his colleagues & said may be later tonight. i said its 9 and she needed to go to bed. he did return to the hotel earlier but left again and i was upset he didnt even bother to call me when he was at the hotel. like he couldnt even spare a few minutes? in the morning, as part of our regular routine we went to the park and it was around 11 and no call from him. so i called him and said lets do a video chat. we did a quick video. night time comes and no call from him. i didnt even bother to call him. and i already told him in the morning that shes having a weird sleep regression or may be going through the 2 to 1 nap transition so she didnt nap for the two days and slept poorly at night. am i asking for too much for him to even want to just call us to see how we are doing? he used to call randomly during work. i just keep having thoughts or questions in my head like - doesnt he miss us? his daughter? is he really out on a company event ?is he even where he says he is? im just venting. my daughter finally went to bed. wine will be needed. thank you all.

i dont know where to stand on recent events	long story short, my oldest daughters step mom threw concentrated bleach into her eye. its a little bit of a long story but heres the info to our issue.. this happened a little over two weeks ago. i was out of town getting a tattoo when her dad sent me a short text saying that my daughter got bleach in her eye and that they washed it out. the casualness of the text made me think a very tiny minuscule amount got in her eye and they took care of it. but when i got home five hours later i asked to see her to check on her , when she woke up from her nap an hour later he walked her up and i came to the door seeing my 5 year old balling her eyes out. she didnt want me to see it, im assuming because she knew i would do something about it. but when i seen her i was in shock. in shock that they havent done more than some well water to her face for what they said was a collective of 40 minutes. i immediately hugged her then looked at her eye and undoubtedly knew she needed to go the hospital. her dad, which im not fond of but is an otherwise good parent, kept explaining to me how hes had stuff in his eye before and that hes fine . he gave me the run around of what happened but i was just trying to get her to the hospital. at the local er i heard bad news so fast and so unexpected that i gasped and cried. they were going to transport her to duke hospital . as a mother, you never want to hear that your hospital needs a better hospital to care for your little one. guys... she was already color blind and couldnt tell how many fingers the nurse was holding up. the hours we were there waiting for duke ambulance to transport her was a horrible precursor to what needed to be done. the ph in her eye was 11. one of the nurses told me her eye was melting. they drugged her up to make her as comfortable as possible and tried their best to flush it until the ambulance showed up. best believe when it did i followed it the whole way there. she was in so much pain. shes scared, young, in a new place and all these strangers are trying to mess with her freaking melting eyeball. so i was okay with comfort measures duke had to offer. you just want comfort for your baby after all. they stuck a tube in her eye to flush it out for two hours, then they gave her ketamine so they could run the exam that she wouldnt let them do . thankfully it didnt reach the back of her eye. there was extensive damage done but her eye pressure was normal again. once they got the ph back normal they sent her home with me and did a follow up the next day i cannot explain to you how relieving the good news was! her eye was already almost completely healed! she left the office happy with the good news because i was happy. she is such a selfless and strong little one. even though she still couldnt open her eye, the pain had gone down a lot because of the prescriptions drops so she could be present again. the follow ups so far are not what we want ideally but its a lot better than what we originally though, which was that she would lose the eye. its like our wishes came true! so if youre still with me, thank you. i explained so much for context. heres where we get to the point of my post. her step mon claims that she was filling up and cleaning the kiddie pool while my daughter was also in the pool about to help her wipe it down. i know, already a big no-no. my daughter was spinning around and thats when she claims the bleach she was pouring into the pool got into her eye. only one eye...while she was spinning in circles. the bleach that was being poured into a pool knee height.. backstory on step-mom shes been in her life since before she was born. weve had major issues for the first 2 or so years because she smokes cigarettes in the house my daughter lives at with her dad. we have joint custody and he sees her 50% of the time. she is ten years older than my daughters father. she has no job, her license taken, has four kids, isnt allowed to see two of them, the other two she doesnt have custody of and they dont come around. she has three baby daddies . other than that she has been very active and taken care of her while my daughters dad is at work. soooo. even though i really cannot believe that someone would purposely do something so heinous to such a sweet child, the story doesnt make sense what so ever. from the beginning of the event its a bunch of text book no-nos. there are days where i believe its purely an accident out of sheer stupidity. then there are days where i just sit and look and my baby who still cant open her eye all the way and see worth of shit and wonder what really happened. my daughter says it was an accident but she explains the story exactly as shes heard it. i just dont know where to sit and what to do because regardless of if it was an accident or not there was a lot of neglect that took place afterwards on both of their parts. hes always been a good dad, and nothing has ever happened like this with her and her step mom before. im just so worried that if i dont do something about her step mom living with him that something may happen again. after all, i never thought this would happen to begin with. i do know that if we go to court again it will be a hell of a lot of bad consequences because her dad is selfish and ruthless. i dont know what to do but i feel like i should do something. everyone is surprised when they find out im still letting her go over there. we have joint custody, i dont have a choice even if i was sure of what to do. so if you took the time to read this insanely long post, thank you again! i needed to get it out in one clear thought and know someone out there would acknowledge it. ive had nightmares of that night. even though my 5 year old daughter has reminded me how to be strong, it still hurts so much to see and know the damage that was done. if you have any advice or words please let me hear them. namaste	Current-Library-4579	/r/Mommit/comments/pirxmy/i_dont_know_where_to_stand_on_recent_events/	9	10	0	1.0	1630901065.0
need help with the guilt	i'm a mom to a 5.5 month old, the absolute love of my life. i never thought love like this was even possible. i'm also a doctor and will be resuming my practice next month. i was always a very practical person but pregnancy and childbirth has changed me. i've become more anxious in general. i have an excellent support system so i'm not really worried if my baby will be alright when i'm not home. no. its more about the emotional aspect. would he forget me if i'm away from him for days at a time? would he feel abandoned? i miss treating my patients i'm intensely workaholic so i know going back to the hospital will do me a lot of good. but i cannot stop thinking about my baby. what is this? i'm sure many of you have faced this. i would love to hear what helped you.

the vaccine is where i draw the line	my baby is almost three months. my husbands sister refuses to get the vaccine, her bf says its a personal choice. i need help finding a way to politely say shes not allowed around my baby until shes vaccinated. i said to him that it is a personal choice, kinda, but if thats the choice theyre making then theyre also choosing not to be in my babies life. so moms, how would you approach this? how would you tell someone theyre absolutely not allowed near me, my husband or my child until theyre vaccinated? i dont want to be mean because i like her, but i just wont budge on this. edit to add everyone who doesnt live with us, vaccinated or not, have to wear a mask before seeing the baby. edit 2 we talked, she understands but is set against the vaccine. i told her wed video chat once a week if not more until the pandemic is over so she can still be apart of his life to some extent and were still on good terms. thank you everyone for the advice!! you guys made it possible to have a very neutral conversation about this issue and i couldnt be more thankful! the last thing i wanted was to lose her as a friend and relative and your advice helped me beyond what i expected.	aggravated-asphalt	/r/Mommit/comments/pjrkzi/the_vaccine_is_where_i_draw_the_line/	161	368	0	0.9	1631035357.0

who is allowed to be upset?	so i had my baby shower this past saturday. it was at our house held completely outside, except for the bathroom. we have a bathroom just kn the inside of the door that leads to the backyard/deck. i made signs. 1 asking people to where masks upon entering and to only come in to use the bathroom. explaining its to keep mom and baby safe. 2 labeling the bathroom and changing area. i did set up a changing area. it was on our washer but had a towel and changing pad and wipes. 3 i had a few signs near doorways asking people not to go beyond that point, again in order to keep it as safe for baby and i as possible. my husband even put air purifiers in those walkways to kinda deter people from walking through them. party starts. only people not following the mask request is my in-laws because we are all vaccinated. but what got me is that some just started walking around the house ignoring the signs. it really pissed me off. we had games and food outside. you can wait outside until the bathroom is free. you dont need to walk throughout someones house. then my bils wife comes. she has two kids a 4yr boy and 2yr girl. she comes in the house with her diaper backpack and starts walking towards the living roomshe has a habit of using our couch or bed as a changing table since they do that in their house and dont see how others might not like it. my mother was in the room preparing food and says oh op set up a nice changing area in the bathroom over there hinting that there was no reason to be walking further. and the wife says oh its cute shes getting prepared, apparently under the assumption i made it for our babymy mother says no for the all the guests to use she sighs, moves the air purifier and just throws her bag on the couch, which apparently frightened one of our cats who proceeded to hide for the rest of the day. later on she complained about being asked to use a changing station. saying it was hard to change the 4yr old on it. i personally thought it was a nice touch, and as mentioned it had a towel and a pad and even some wipes out. all the other moms seemed to like it. but she even said to me when you have a baby youll find the couch is your best friend late at night for context im having a c-section and the nursery is on the second floor. the baby will be in our room and ill need to change him on our bed and couch while im recovering. but i actually look forward to being able to go upstairs and use the nursery when i am able to. idk i am really upset at my in-laws for all ignoring our simple requests. wear masks, stick to the bathroom, dont go beyond the one room. i tried to talk to my in-laws individually as they ignored the rules and was met with a lot of attitude and was even called a drama queen by my sils husband. was i wrong to be upset? i never know with hormones and such.

i am nervous about getting a part time daytime babysitter --how can i do this safely during covid?	hi everyone can anyone share with me if they've had any luck this past year with hiring part-time daytime babysitter? i feel like it is a necessity to get one but i have been putting it off because we are nervous about covid--spouse is immunocompromised. right now we are at the point that we feel we need one or things will be getting worse in our household. what have you done to hire a babysitter safely? i know this sounds horrible and i do not like thinking this....but how do i know my babysitter will be telling me the truth about keeping safety precautious and keeping a very small social bubble?

i just dont want to care anymore	i dont really have anyone to turn to right now. i guess this is a bent and cry for help as well i feel like an absolute terrible failure of a mother. struggling with continuing to breastfeed my lo i had to return to work in june and so lo is bottlefed during the day while im gone. now, he refuses to latch or breastfeed when i offer to nurse but will eat from the bottle with no complaint. i feel like a failure. if he does choose to breastfeed, its during the night when hes super drowsy and wakes for a little snack. im trying so hard to be ok about itto be happy that he is eating and gaining weight, but it hurts so much when he refuses to nurse and cries at the breast. trying not to be depressed but am having thoughts of just giving up on everything. im so exhausted and just dont want to have to care about anything anymore.

dae who breastfeeds have a baby that is super sensitive to caffeine?	i had half a cup of coffee this morning and my baby has been awake the entire day, despite trying to put her down for naps every half hour or so. she has also been pooping a lot. i completely abstained from caffeine during my pregnancy so that may have caused her to be more sensitive but this seems very intense. i can tell she is tired but she will not go to sleep. i have tried all our usual methods, which she has dozed off for maybe a few minutes each time and then woke up pissed. i just am curious if anyone else has experienced this and how to cope? i am totally exhausted.	silentbutjudgey	/r/Mommit/comments/pk36z4/dae_who_breastfeeds_have_a_baby_that_is_super/	2	2	0	0.75	1631074102.0
struggling every day	my baby is difficult. i understand all babies are difficult but she is the baby that other moms describe as a handful , busy , fussy , grouchy etc. she is the baby that elicits the comment, my babies were never like that . she is coming up on 9 months and i keep waiting for it to get better but it doesn't. she does not like to sleep. though shes been sleep trained for ages, she's never slept more than 10.5 hours at night. she naps 2-3 hours a day depending on how pissed off she is. we have tried every sleep recommendation that exists and nothing makes her sleep longer. she does not stop moving. she is constantly pulling herself up, standing, grabbing everything in sight and falling. i have to be with her at all times because she is still so young she does not have the strength to do these things independently. she desperately wants to walk and whines and yells when she can't . we practice walking but it just makes her angrier. she cannot sit still to focus on a book or a toy for more than a minute without having to get up and move or without getting angry. everything makes her angry. god forbid you take something dangerous away from her. she screamed bloody murder. done playing with a toy, screaming. i walk away, screaming. can't feed her fast enough, screaming. trying to change her clothes or diaper, end of the world screaming. she is almost never happy. she is wearing me down. i'm starting to lose focus on every day tasks like driving or even thinking clearly enough to make a grocery list. i will be back to work in 3 months and cannot comprehend how i can work all day, come home and deal with her misery. i cannot comprehend how i can continue to function with her waking up well before 6am every morning. i cannot imagine a time when this will all be okay. i am out of ideas. out of energy. out of joy. i don't know what i am looking for here... encouragement? commiseration? ideas? stories of babies who grew out of it? all i know is i'm exhausted and something's gotta give... edit thank you to everyone for the comments. i am working through them and feel the strength of community support. with regards to the sleep comment, her doctor has told me that 12.5-13.5 hours a day is not enough. i am also one of those people who has the friends who's babies are all doing 15 hours a day which, in my mind, supports my doctor's comments. yes, i realize 10.5 is more than many babies and for that i am grateful.	elliebellybaby	/r/Mommit/comments/pkan1e/struggling_every_day/	42	32	0	0.82	1631108111.0
what is normal 3 month sleep?	ftm, snoo user with a 3 month old baby sleeping in my bedroom. she goes to bed independently but her max sleep is probably about 2-3 hours. she wakes up throughout the night, not crying but making lots of noise that wakes me up. i can usually get her to go back down with gentle soothing or replacing a paci. we do one feed during the night. does that sound age appropriate/normal? im so tired from her waking up all night, yet at the same time i think shes doing pretty well. im just unclear what it means for a baby to sleep through the night. are there actually parents out there of babies this age who are not waking up at all except to feed? im trying to figure out what to do move her into her own room or transition to her crib, stop swaddling i dont even know where to begin. just feeling tired and overwhelmed.	wammy22	/r/Mommit/comments/pkjl5a/what_is_normal_3_month_sleep/	4	2	0	1.0	1631136435.0
at what age is it ok for me to tell my cousins kid to stop being rude?	my cousins son has always been the type of kid to be deliberately rude. he thinks its funny and his parents arent the type to correct him. we had a family zoom the other day and he used it as an opportunity to roast people. mostly he was talking about how old and gross all of his aunts and uncles look after quarantining for over a year. hes almost thirteen and i feel like thats old enough where i may start telling him to knock it off. my kid is much younger so im not sure if im expecting too much. could any parents of older kids weigh in? im not going to yell at him. id say something along the line of youre being unkind and i dont appreciate it.

feel like i've been through hell with my toddler today. i just want to cry!	today has been insanely hard and i don't even know how to process all of it. my son is 2.5 years old and he is normally a very laid-back, easy going little boy. he almost never has tantrums or even stops smiling. except today all he did was scream and cry for most of it. with the exception of a few hours here and there of normal playing and laughing, he screamed and cried the rest of the day while never wanting to be let go. my son is speech delayed and in speech therapy and there's some signs of autism so we're having him tested for it. the past few days he has been throwing out more and more sounds, babbling, and even attempting to repeat words and phrases i say to him. he's even started saying mama, bubba for when he wants a bottle or mama, long babble word when he wants something else. he's never done this before and we're so insanely excited! the problem i have now is that i have no idea if the crying and excessive fussiness is from trying so hard to start talking or if i'm missing something else wrong and it's killing me. i have anxiety and ptsd from my childhood so i instantly always jump to worst case scenario which means i'm not the best judge of these things. he has no fever, is eating, drinking, and using the bathroom with zero issues. i just don't know what i could be missing but i also don't know if fussiness when taking this big leap is normal. any other moms that can ease my worries or tell me i'm not crazy for feeling like i'm missing something? i don't have any other mom's really to ask these questions too and i feel like i'm drowning in the what-ifs. i just want to be the best mom i can be but i also have zero idea what i'm doing sometimes.	marshmomma18	/r/Mommit/comments/pkmdqq/feel_like_ive_been_through_hell_with_my_toddler/	3	5	0	1.0	1631145766.0

out of curiosity how much $$ would you estimate you spent on your babys first year of clothing? or how much would you be willing to spend? no judgement allowed.	ive been becoming more and more curious about the answer to these two questions, especially when i see parents post hundreds of dollars worth of baby clothing for sale on facebook marketplace once their child has outgrown them. we had very little money to spend on clothing for our first child, so he wore almost all hand-me-downs and thrifted stuff. but i know that isnt the situation for everyone. so im wondering how much do you estimate you spent on clothing for your childs first year of life? how much would you be willing to spend on a full wardrobe for the first year of your childs life? absolutely no judgement from me or anyone else. everyone has their priorities and everyone has their means. some people like clothes, some people like tech, some people like food, some people like travel, and some people like buying stuff for their kids. you do you.	jayceenicole17	/r/Mommit/comments/pkrp96/out_of_curiosity_how_much_would_you_estimate_you/	15	4	0	0.83	1631166148.0
when do i become family? my child?	so this is more of a rant/in need of support & opinions about a current situation. skip down for the current situation i've been with my partner for over 7 years and we have a 1yo together. not married but we own property together. for some odd reason his family always takes precedence, not over my family no, over his longtime partner and child. apparently we don't count as much. this has been apparent in a few ways. first, just 2 days after the birth of your child one of his close elderly family members died, it was sudden but not unexpected due to his health concerns. he left me home alone, stuck on the tip floor, with a newborn and dogs needing outside potty breaks. i was by myself from 8am to 10pm, he or my sisters would stop by to make sure i had water and would let out the dogs 1-2x a day. he also invited a family member over who invaded personal bathroom space while i was still bleeding from birth, we had agreed no visitors like that for 2 weeks but we needed to compromise. it took 3 days before i broke down and he finally stayed home with us and asked the family member to stay elsewhere. his family never told him to go back to his newborn and partner, they may have been caught up in grief but i still struggle with resentment towards them. at 3mos pp, he got a call that his dad was going to need open heart surgery. without telling me, he took off a full week of work and planned to travel up and help his dad. admirable but paired with the fact that he argued over taking extra pto for the birth of our child and it feels icky to me. didn't help that this overlapped with my birthday and he failed to even try to celebrate with me when he got home. i went out with my sisters after a hellish week being 100% caregiver for a 3mo. 2 min showers because he was screaming the whole time, listening to him cry while i struggled with laundry baskets due to an unhealed injury from birth, it was an awful week. we both agreed that was not going to happen again. he's done this a few other times where he will take pto for his family to visit but won't make time for me or the child. he didn't request off for the kid's 1st birthday and needed to finagle time with his job at the last minute. decided against celebrating our anniversary. forgot mother's day until 5pm when his mother reminded him of it. refused to take pto when i was laid out after the 2nd vaccine, barely able to move from the couch let alone care for our kid. i consider him somewhat forgetful but also with confused priorities. we also talk about this at length since my job is all about talk therapy and communication. i don't analyze him or anything but make sure my expectations are known and ensure he has space to say his thoughts/emotions. onto the current issue his family is having a reunion paired with a goodbye party for a relative that is struggling with their health. this is extended family and hasn't seen a majority of these family members since the last reunion so they are not close. our area is seeing a moderate but, from my work in the community, quite alarming spike in positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the delta variant. my job is back to masks 100%. the population here is 50/50 about the pandemic and vaccines, we just had parents protesting mask mandates in schools this past week for reference. his family falls strongly into the half of people refusing masks and vaccines or won't confirm vaccination status out of principle. we've already had to quarantine for 2 weeks before christmas last year because they didn't let my partner know they were feeling ill when he brought our 6mo over. they tested positive but fortunately we were ok. in comparison, my sisters tested positive with symptoms a couple weeks pp and they stayed away, giving me daily updates and making sure we were safe. he wants to go to this reunion so bad. anything i say isn't a good enough reason. our kid isn't vaccinated, if we get sick despite being vaccinated our jobs will be severely affected, we cannot afford an er visit or hospital stay, no one will wear a mask, he struggles to uphold boundaries with his family, our child likes to touch anything and everything, he is the main childcare during the week so him going alone is still bad. like from my view it is a bad idea and his parents understand and are now arriving early to spend time with us before going to the party. good compromise in a bad situation. i find out that his other relatives were badmouthing me and arguing with him over not going to this party. their reasons are that its no different than going to target . we wear masks, avoid the maskless, don't maintain extended contact for more than 15 min and don't let people get in our child's face at target, not the same imo. the reunion will be outside but inside if it rains, all bathrooms are inside, and this house is not the size of a target so no physical distance. this restarted a fight and i know i am likely being overcautious but what is it hurting to not attend this reunion? i see endless risks and even though i'd love to go and meet all these family members, i can't forget about my 1yo. knowing i willingly exposed him to a virus he has limited ability to fight off would eat me up inside if he did actually get sick. he is my family, my priority, but having a partner that doesn't perpetually sulk about this reunion is getting higher on the priority list. i love that he cares for his family but ffs when am i and his son finally going to become 'family' and be prioritized when it is clearly needed in the moment? i feel crappy for even trying to equate the family member's death and the open heart surgery to some of the stuff we've gone through but its truly his behavior around that which concerns me. thank you for reading this rant, i know it was long. tldr partner wants to go to family reunion with vaccine/pandemic-denier extended family. put my foot down since we have a 1yo and now i'm contemplating when the hell his son/partner will get to that coveted family level of priority.

how do naps work at daycare for an 18 month old? 	hi, so i am starting a new job in a few weeks only 3 days a week, but they are 8 hour days. both my mom and my husbands mom were sahms and none of us or siblings ever went to daycare. im already a nervous wreck enough letting my precious daughter be away from me with strangers all day, but one of my main concerns is how naptime will go? i know i can always ask the daycare themselves but im curious about moms who have gone through this with their babies. my baby girl is a tricky napper. she goes down perfectly without a fight but only for me and only in her crib at home. anywhere else its a nightmare. im afraid she will never sleep at all especially with all the kids and excitement. how has it worked for you guys? i am just so scared of all this i think my mom traumatized me about daycare throughout my life by pounding into my head about how terrible daycares are and kids get abused and molested and neglected. and while i know those things can happen, i also am award that most kids are just fine. my mom is also a very traditional mom who kinda criticizes me for ever doing anything but being a perfect housewife so thats just why im all nervous. i know its very common for parents to have to work and i know my baby will live. its just sometimes hard to not think the worst after how i was raised. anyway, any advice or experience to calm this nervous moms nerves would be so amazing!!	juliaakatrinaa0507	/r/Mommit/comments/plcfzx/how_do_naps_work_at_daycare_for_an_18_month_old/	3	1	0	1.0	1631241974.0

how to tell my kids their dad wont be here this weekend because he is in hospital for self harm?	he missed his 5 hours of parenting time last week because his foot hurt. i really needed that time to process and plan because im going through an issue with my family and i got a big job offer. the issue was my dad shoved me after i wouldnt let him berate my 4yo son and i tried to get between them to calm the situation down. ex took my dads side and said i should just apologize. then the very next day is the day he called out of his parenting time. he treated parenting like a job he could just call in sick to, and i had some very strong words for him about that. very mean words which obviously now i wish i could take back. the 2 year old has been waking up every morning asking if its time to see his dad yet. literally the first words out of his mouth. the 4 year old told his dad he hated him, and his dad seemed really upset by that. but 4yo is still upset about the situation with his grandpa and now his dad isnt showing up either. its not nice to say you hate someone, which we talked about, but i can see why hes upset. i havent heard much else from ex. i blocked him except for his designated phone call with the kids time twice a week. and then i heard from his pastor that hes been taken to the hospital for plans of suicide. i feel really bad for these kids having all these adults around that are just not handling their shit. their dad sent a video of him saying he loves them and hes not going to be there because hes getting some help but im not sure i should show it. hes in a hospital bed with nurses in the background. we just had a friend die of covid so that might really scare them. the kids are whip smart and will ask a million questions. what do i tell them thats age appropriate and truthful?	happybabymama	/r/Mommit/comments/plo5ej/how_to_tell_my_kids_their_dad_wont_be_here_this/	8	7	0	0.9	1631290355.0

what is one thing that you feel has made it easier for you to maintain a cleaner, more organized home?	i have a 10 month old little dude, i am at work for 8-9 hours a day. i commute 1 hour to work. i drop the little one off to my mil in the morning and pick him up after work. i usually spend about give or take 30 min chatting with her about his day. how'd he eat, nap, poop, his mood. you get it. by the time we get home it's already 6 30ish, sometimes 7 00 if we had to stop along the way. then we start supper and by 8 00 baby is getting his bottle and being put down for to sleep. it is usually 8 30/9 00 by the time i have him in his bed and i finally get a few min to breath for myself. sometimes later if little dude is having a rough night. with all that being said. i find it incredibly hard to keep up with house work this way. especially my kitchen. after he is asleep i go around tidying up some, put some clothes washing, throw the load from the dryer in the clean clothes pile. but i don't do dishes because all the noise will wake him up. i really only get to do dishes on the weekends. by then its piled up and kinda gross and takes too long. i'd prefer be spending time with my child or if given the chance, taking some needed time for myself. but i don't want him to be in an unclean environment. short of getting a maid i'm not sure what else to do. i have started to declutter in the sense that no, i don't need 15 mugs in a house with 2 adults . i am packing away unnecessary kitchenware so therefore it can't pile up as easily. i do have a dishwasher but it's kinda crappy and i end up hand washing most things anyway. otherwise, the routine i have going now is not working for me and i'm tired of looking around my house feeling defeated bc i don't have the time or energy to keep up. any tips, tricks, hacks, or change in practices you have used that have helped in just keeping up with the basics of housekeeping would be greatly appreciated.	bullet_maiden	/r/Mommit/comments/ply7c3/what_is_one_thing_gadget_routine_change_etc_that/	36	13	0	1.0	1631324563.0
is there an article explaining to husbands how much work being a sahm is?	i recently started staying home with my 3 kids ages 4, 2, and 6 months. and as much as i love all of the time with them, it is hard and i have no time without them except when we sleep at night. my husband is working 6 days this week and he slept until his alarm and refused to get up any earlier despite the fact that the rest of the house was awake, because he worked every day this week. so when he finally graced us with his presence, i asked when my day off is, and when i get to sleep in? and he rolled his eyes and kept walking. then he walks into the kids so cheerful and playful like hes the fun hero whos gonna go make the kids chocolate milk now. i am harboring so much resentment but the adhd in me is finding it very hard to communicate properly. we dont have nearby family and childcare is impossible , so i cant even find someone to just give me a break. how can i explain to my husband that i am not just living some kind of vaca life??

dealing with stomach virus - any words of wisdom or advice appreciated	my little guy vomited thursday night around 9pm. had a fever on and off until around 6pm last night. we did clear fluids then the brat diet. he ate toast, a popsicle and is still nursing so he had a lot of breast milk too. when he went to bed last night we thought he had recovered. he was up intermittently from 3-7am and vomited twice every time he wakes up. he asked for and drank water around 3am. no fever, no diarrhea. temp is 98.0. is it normal for a stomach virus to fluctuate with with fever and other symptoms? i was thinking of getting a house call to check for an ear infection. ive never dealt with this before and dont know what to do - he cant tell me how he feels. hes not tugging on his ears or anything, he also really didnt eat much yesterday.	pnwgirl0	/r/Mommit/comments/pm8z8d/dealing_with_stomach_virus_any_words_of_wisdom_or/	6	1	0	1.0	1631372548.0
looking for advice tw self harm	my lo is only 5 months so im definitely getting ahead of myself but im wondering if any moms have any experience with having self harm scars and explaining them to your kids. i have a lot of scarring all over my arms and i often wonder what he will think, will he ask about them? how should i go about discussing it? i plan to be honest in an age appropriate way but im just looking for any other experiences. when i got pregnant i got serious about my mental health, got a counselor, got on some anti depressants and havent had any self harm incidents since before he was born and i im doing really well now. the scars are beginning to fade but some are pretty deep.	45235235346457568780	/r/Mommit/comments/pmiev6/looking_for_advice_tw_self_harm/	19	34	0	0.97	1631405504.0
