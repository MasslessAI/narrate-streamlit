what if during the time left they nail down oracle or microsoft-like prospects? 80% of sales managers need at least five follow-up calls after a personal meeting with a prospect to close the deal. ...i read somewhere that there's only one excuse for a sales manager to stop following up a prospect when either one of them is dead. 44% of sales managers regularly give up after the first call. ...c'mon guys, give prospects a second chance! do you believe that a seasoned sales specialist can sell almost anything?

what i thought was a more realistic and motivating story for young kids in the city, just wasnt big enough for the media. thats what i hated. what about you? what do you hate most about being a saas founder?","40":"can any saas business owner share their experience in getting their first customer.","41":"could be for any industry. just something that you believe disrupts an industry or is able to make peoples lives genuinely better and easier.","42":"we have developers who are good at php. we need a framework so that we can scale rapidly. we are trying to build a crm saas app so we have a lot of dataflow everyday. can anyone suggest some good frameworks or any reliable technology which will allows us to build a scalable and a reliable saas app?","43":"its not statisticalat least not pure statistics. this post is not one to give you the formula or the mathematical explanation of why this correlates to that. this post is more about feeling and less about thinking. more about communicating and more about intuition. it is in line with my previous articles. for context, i advocate for getting in touch 1-on-1 with your user, even though its not scalable. at the same time, i advocate for not asking people what do they think about your product. if its amazing or dreadful, they will vent it outmore so on the latter. if its in the middle, theyll be silent. it doesnt mean its boring, it can just mean it didnt cause any feelingstheres room to expand on creating an experience. the answer when users go out of their way to say thank you, thats when you know theyre a true fan. they dont always have time to do that, they dont always feel comfortable with striking a conversation out of nowhere or they might think it doesnt make a difference if i say thank you. some do and youll get a message in your inbox. however, heres the thing if youd go out and reach out to them, it doesnt take a long time for anyone to write hey, didnt ever think of writing to you but your product helped us a lot. thats a sentence as a reply email. those are what kevin kelly called true fansand his article about reaching out. the idea is that it has such a bigger impact if done. what would you rather talk about? the ceo of shake shack that sent you an email or jeff bezos divorce? something that happened within your vicinity or a bigger event that youre not really connected with? number 4 , giving more than they expected. hey, thanks for paying in full for a year. heres one extra month, just because were grateful. and that doesnt mean you need to lose money. its like the white gloves service or the insurance business. its like the dropped macaron pricing that i mentioned a few weeks ago. if i know im paying for 10 pieces, youve made the price so as to account for 11 pieces and then you say heres a free one, itll have a much much bigger impact. its like a surprise, like santa claus. its true, i wont cry of happiness or even care in an hour that your company gave me more. but it did matter for those.5 seconds or 5 seconds. > objection yes, daniel, but how many more am i losing because i increased, basically, my price? to which id answer those 0.5 to 5 seconds of gratitude, even if it happens to 2 people out of 10 , youre still about to win. youre about to win because thats how relationship building works, thats how brand building is happening and thats how these motherfuckers will tell other grateful motherfuckers about it and youre about to create a true network\/circle of people who are using your stuff. the conclusion be good, for goodness sake. and itll come back to you, even if it looks like a cost today. however, all these ideas are easier to implement for some and harder for others. i said this in an interview the other dayits easier to give out and to expect nothing help people get off the ground be in the position of for those who win, more will be given as opposed to for those who have nothing, everything will be taken when your mental is strong. when insecurities and negative emotions are acknowledged, when neediness is not present and when theres internal peace. but hey, thats outside the scope of measuring user churn. the conclusion in a nutshell is > measuring user churn statistically is quantifiable and gives people the sense of securityyou can at least know it. > > measuring it based on how many truthful interactions youve got is what can keep you prospering long-term. because when you have a truthful interaction, thats a micro-win both for you and the other person. and if you win now, youll keep winning. _ _ originally posted here","44":"we are looking at launching a new screen sharing product for online sales demos and i'm looking for places where i can find folks who'd be interested in getting a free account in exchange for providing feedback. i've made some posts in a couple of sales specific fb groups and slack rooms. i've gotten about 50 folks who are helping right now, but looking for another 50. any suggestions on sales\/marketing communities that would be good for me to check out?","45":"hey guys, i'm wondering how you are pitching your saas to potential leads who have requested a demo; specifically in b2b context selling complex solutions. furthermore, we are trying to commoditize our solution for smaller organisations, thinking about automating and scaling the demo game. few qs do you meet face to face, or mostly in web presentations? which conference tools are you using? go2meeting, skype...? how much time do you actually spend demoing your solution ? what percentage of your demo do you use to talk about your prospect's pain points? do you have any best practices to gain and retain your audiences attention? especially in remote demo settings? do you use pre-recorded\/generic demo videos as part of your qualification process? have you ever changed the way you do demos? to be fair, for the past five years we have been doing the exact same demo path over and over again. we did not reflect a single time on what we were showing and doing. most demos last around 90minutes of which we usually spend 60min in the software. i've got the feeling that we are losing our audience especially during remote demos; there is just too much distraction like emails, phones... and we dont have any control over our listeners... would be happy to hear your toughts, feedback and answers or any best practices! i'm afraid our demo \/ win ratio is rather low despite investing too much time... thanks!","46":"i'm trying to start out selling a b2b small business product. all the reasonable .com's that describe what my business does are gone, or being auctioned off for 5 figures. my question is, how important is this really?

why would that be of any importance? does it apply in other fields of business? let's think about it. we all know women who have their hairstylist and to which they've been going to for years they're definitely not looking for alternatives as all's good. the mental and emotional price they'd need to pay in order to find a new one is kinda high and it's not worth paying it when everything seems to be fine. in fact, they actually might be served better by someone else it is possible. however, the mere thought of breaking the personal connection is too much. why is it that they're stuck with their hairstylist? i would say it's pretty much the fact that their experience is personal enough for them. they've been knowing each other, have been interacting for some time and vetted each other. how does is that relevant in tech? creating an experience as a tech company is more complex than a hairstylist and their clients. besides, i know you also want to make it scalable. but i think here's where the fork in the road appears. most people look at scalable and choose serve everyone . because scalable can mean works for everyone . apple is for everyone, right? amazon is the same, right? wrong. arguably they are today but they surely were not in the beginning. amazon was for book people in the beginning. apple was for the techies who were part of the homebrew club. some years later, their imac was for the creators. their ipod was for music people. we can go on and on. eventually, indeed, audiences cross-breed but that's because of the very strong impact a company's hit is. which brings me to people who choose the other way in that choice i was mentioning above. these few people... understand that scale comes as a by-product of doing the non-scalable. it doesn't make sense, i know the math adds up only for the first road. but only through doing the non-scalable you can understand what is actually scalable and what isn't. and if that is too abstract, i'll say this you absolutely need to be as personal as possible for as long as possible to your users, before going into full scale. because only through spending a lot of time with extremely personal experiences you can notice patterns and automate your way to millions of or $ in mrr. sweet, right? not at all, it may seem. but it indeed becomes bliss to do that on the daily if you're not about getting there quick right now and rather enjoying the road to getting there .

and by work i don't mean they're some magical spells that will manipulate them to your advantage. i mean something that will work like the smiley face in basecamp works for young ambitious programmers whose missions are to change the world into a better place. they won't react too well to microsoft's pitch microsoft is looking at multi-billion corporate deals, where the other party is wearing a black\/navy suit and tie. the same way the people in suits won't really take basecamp seriously.","58":"i'm toying with the idea of increasing my free trial period - which at present is just 7 days. what are your experiences with trial period lengths?

do you provide this kind of input at all? how do you make sure people actually see the right piece of content that is aligned to their needs, rather than a generic video which does not resonate with their pain points? what kind of personal information do you gather before showing such automated video? if so, what is your experience - does this lack of personal contact reduce your number of leads? follow-up after in-person demo once we have done a face-to-face or at least remote demo with the core team or our innovation champion, many other demos might follow. have you ever thought about e.g. putting together an individual storyboard per prospect with specific video-snippets of your software? like a link you could send them which they will share internally with all other stakeholders, that is providing a snappy summary of your system and how it is solving their needs? instead of exchanging 100 of emails, explaining the same stuff over and over again, being highly dependent of your champion - this could make life much easier. and potentially enables you to track the engagement\/who is watching what video. &; in my opinion there is a clear need to automate and scale the demo business, but i'm worried the lack of personal interaction will have negative impact on the relationship - especially during the discovery phase. feedback appreciated!","61":"i am trying to figure out what is the industry name for companies like mirakl, or sharetribe that are specialized in building online marketplaces. are they a regular saas?

10 businesses. i recently had a new customer reach out who wants to use the software but wants it to integrate with their accounting software. i told them that we didn't currently offer any integrations, even though it is on the product roadmap. they now have reached back out asking for a quote for how much it would cost to do the integration, basically paying me to build something i was going to build anyway. integrating with accounting software is currently not planned until after beta. the one that they use is popular so they would not be the only one to benefit from the integration too. my time as a developer is stretched really thin right now so i would like to outsource the integration. my questions are 1. are there outsource companies that specifically do accounting integrations? 2. has anyone used or heard of any good ones they would recommend? 3. how should i quote this back to the customer?","79":"i'm entirely dependent on a growing group of saas

to build a website. she finished college at 20 and started a social media consultancy at 22. 7 years later, laura launched meetedgar . does your mvp lack focus? perhaps you need to know your customers better. roeder had a dream list for edgar a mile long. but her husband and technical co-founder, chris, kept her focused. he had extensive experience . i learned from him to keep things as lean and simple as possible. he kept focusing on whats needed now, versus everything else we could do after the launch. theres a never-ending list of features you can create. im a huge believer in lets face it. pricing your product isnt easy. roeder was no different. pricing is really hard. we never felt like we got this right. from my previous businesses, i learned about the joy of high pricing. a lot of people underestimate the difficulty of getting five-times more customers when comparing $10\/month to $50\/month. although meetedgar now offers one plan at $49\/month, once upon a time there were more higher-priced plans. specifically, there was a business plan at $550\/month and an agency plan at $1,000\/month. we put them on thinking maybe if a big customer wants to come to pay us a lot of money, well let them. but surprise, surprise. thats not how it works. , you need a sales process. we are only focused on small business. we dont have a sales team. we do weekly demos that you can sign on, but theres no one to give you a one on one sales process with the company, _ . 3. paid advertisements. 4. sales. 5. business development and partnerships. i talk more about these five channels in, although meetedgar now focuses a lot on seo, ads were a major play in the beginning. cashflow is an important part of a successful business. a dollar today is worth more than $5 in a year. and ads can be an excellent opportunity to get results faster. in saas, the sooner you can get a customer, the better. so we spent way more into paid ads in the first year than we have ever since. we had a large spend. organic takes time, where paid is instant, unless you have insane luck. you can pay google and facebook the audience you can afford. are you curious about what ads performed the best? for roeder, it was telling small business owners they were a new tool. i love saying you are a new tool, even when youre not new to the market. the reality is, you are still new to people far after you launch. we would advertise on competitive businesses that liked hootsuite or buffer. our ad said we were a new social media tool. people are curious and are like, i wonder what that is? lets check it out and see if were interested. ads can be an excellent way to generate new sales. but once youve invested $1, the money is spent. after the first year, roeder moved most of the paid ads budget to content marketing, organic search, and word-of-mouth referrals. we did a lot of little content things. podcasts are a big part of our strategy. i love podcasts because theyre less time than guest posts and similar results. after the back-and-forth of booking, you show up and talk for an hour. since launching, now has over 300 articles. these pages brings in hundreds of potential customers as the pages rank in google for keywords like social media topics, linkedin articles, and instagram tv. laura roeders advice on the journey to 1,000 true fans a lot of early-stage entrepreneurs lack focus. to keep it simple, roeder suggests focusing on two areas. when youre building your startup, you have to focus on two things 1. customers need to know you exist. 2. your product has to be worth the money they spend. in software, engineers forget about getting things in front of people. then there are marketers who will throw out anything, then get an outsourced team to build a crap product. there are a lot of ways to get in front of customers. theres social media, content, paid ads, partnerships, among other channels. the best place to start is to figure out your community. you should find the forums, slacks, conferences, and meetups they are apart of. where are they? what are places they hang out, online and in-person? in-person is great to make a customer know, like, and trust you faster. but with a local meetup, youll talk to 10-20 people max at a time. online, youll get more reach, but less of a connection. but in the end, research will only help you go so far. at some point, you need to make a choice. you need to figure out your target market. sometimes you just need to pick. for example, you might say i find bookkeepers are fun to hang out with. but accountants are more valuable. you just need to make a guess and go with it. _for more articles like this, check out my series on 1,000 true fans here._","81":"do you do it yourself? or have someone design it for

have office address or map in neither on their contact page nor in the footer or anywhere else on a website. they often use contact page just to put a form for contacting sales and provide some links to help & support materials. example onfleet.com., as far as i know, not having office address and a map on a contact page is bad for seo and general trust. why do they still prefer showing a sales contact form with no address, map or even general email despite losing potential seo\/trust benefits? is it more of a wise data-driven strategy or a somewhat random choice?","85":"i am trying to send

features that can be enabled for paid users and disabled for other users? how do applications meter and throttle different levels of users? i know you can authenticate users with auth0 , and api gateway seems to provide a lot of this functionality , but how does all this work in practice? if api keys are supposed to be secure, how do you actually use them without exposing them in clear text? if a user isn't supposed to have access to certain features, how do you actually accomplish that? that's just a few of the many questions i have. i know this is a pretty broad question, so i don't expect a comprehensive answer in reddit; rather, i'm looking for tutorials\/demos\/lessons that demonstrate this stuff. there's a ton of content out there on how to create a basic crud service, but there seems to be this gap between that and actually building out the features that would be required for operating a full-fledged saas app.","88":"one of the most talked about topics in the investing

when someone first built this, technically, they risked shopify building it. obviously, they didn't. there's still platform risk there. is anyone in this situation? i'm trying to figure out what's a good idea vs a bad idea. unfortunately, you can consider these products features of the platform they're built on top of - which may make them bad ideas in itself. nonetheless, my first product has

sometimes videos. do you think this does a good job of educating their customers? from a sales a marketing perspective, i typically see screenshots on websites, quick product videos, pre-recorded demos, etc. how well do you think these tactics work?","143":"hey, mates! first, i'd like to disclose that i run a software marketplace \/ software recommendation platform. i'd like to make sure that

library\/framework\/architecture do you use to give users of a saas to add their team members and share the plan?","145":"i have been curious about notion's growth for some time now. recently i have come across the news item that notion is valued at more than $800 million, has one million users and upvoted by more than 6000 product hunt users. i couldn't resist researching their growth strategies. here is a micro analysis on my study originally started in 2014 with a seed round and a team of 4, notion has survived, pivoted and reinvented itself to become one of the most looked after saas companies today. for all its success, notions growth activities remained almost surgical. notion's growth has largely been organic. 1. product notions story is a true product lead growth story. it is an all-in-one productivity app. ease of use fueled by drag and drop functionality impresses its users. design has come to play a key role and became a differentiation. a lot of notions users talk highly of its product design. notion as a product is built largely as a one stop solution. once you are in its ecosystem you do not really to talk to other services significantly. hence they have not built multiple integrations like zoom or slack has done. however to make it easy for users to adopt notion, they have built easy integrations. these integrations are limited to those services from which users are expected to migrate. 2. traffic analysis over 93% of notions traffic is organic which largely constitute of direct and search traffic. this means majority of visitors are coming to notion directly using their url. this indicates that visitors were aware of the notion before hand. a highly targeted community based engagement has the potential to result such traffic. notion is in fact engaged in building a community. they organize meetups across countries and have built location wise local groups.they curate apps created by users in notion template gallery. most of notion's top keywords are branded . github and ycombinator are among the top referring websites in notion's traffic. having github as a major traffic source is an indicator of developers building apps on notion. why is ycombinator sending the traffic? we will find out soon. key takeaways if your product is such where developers, designers etc can create their own work, give them a platform to showcase it. build local chapters and communities. these high touch engagements go long way in improving customer life time value . 3. distribution over half of the startups from ycombinators most recent batch are notions customers. notion has also approached accelerators like 500 startups and techstars offering their startups $1000 in free credits. aws does this too. they readily sponsor startup competitions and offer $1000 in free credits. i had once received such a coupon. it is a different matter that even after more than 18 months i have used only $113 out of it as i find aws too complicated for me. targeting startups so early in their journey is a very smart play. notion counts companies with 100 or less employees as their core users. becoming an 'operating system for startups when they are still in incubator programs is an easy way to ensure continuous flow of new users for years to come. key takeaways clearly define who your customers are and where they are found en masse. target those channels with all you have got. 4. helping prospects to fight confusion two key steps in user's journey to select a solution to their problems are confusion and decision making. every company must try to help users at this stage. helping users fight confusion and make a decision in its favor. on its homepage notion features multiple gif showing the usage of its product. these gif quickly helps in showing the value of the product to visitors. some companies do it using images and explainer videos. i personally favor gif as they are light weight, non intrusive and quickly show the value. notion also creatively poach customers from its competitors. notion does this by boldly calling out unsatisfied users of evernote. they have built a dedicated resource to help such users migrate to notion in just few clicks. key takeaways shorten the users journey to value discovery build resources to help them fight confusion and take a decision in your favor. make it super easy for unsatisfied users of competitors to migrate to your product. entice the ones sitting on fence. this will require building efficient single click tools. it is an engineering activity. 5. wsj article and ph launch notion saw explosive growth in 2018 with the launch of notion 2.0. in march 2018, they launched on product hunt. team notion had experience launching on ph. back in 2016, they launched notion 1.0 on ph which got hunted by naval ravikant. since then they have been launching updates and products every year on ph. during the same month, david pierce published an article praising the app on wall street journal. though i could not find any back story, my hunch is article on wsj and successful ph launch did not happen by themselves. media article had helped zoom too, to gain initial traction. however to make this happen, zoom team systematically engaged walt mossberg over months, even meeting him in person for a demo. key takeaways research well on product hunt launch. to gain first hand experience, launch product every time you have a new version. also launch blog or any other resource you have built to help users. all with same brand name. engage with superstar users on social or email. canva in its early days found out that guy kawasaki is using their product. they met him in person and roped him as their evangelist. guy loved the product so it was an easy deal. someone with following like guy kawasaki talking about your product in high spirits is worth his weight in gold. i am very sure that being hunted by naval ravikant in 2016 had helped notion build credibility. engage with industry analysts and journalists. this is easier than it sounds. by nature of their work, they are on lookout for interesting stories. if you reach out to them to share your product months before you want to get published and keep them engaged with stories, chances are they will write about you. i for once chanced upon a journalist who had changed cities and was between jobs. she happened to write on something related to the domain of one my businesses. i readily helped her with domain research as well as offered her a free copy of a ebook i had written. we ended up being covered in one of her articles later. 6. paid advertising i could not find any of notions google ads. however they are running a handful of facebook ads with a single funnel facebook ad > free notion for students to be very honest, there is nothing exciting in their facebook ads neither the company seems to be going big on ads. this should act as a reminder that paid advertising has nothing to do with saas companies atleast for first few years. i usually argue for using facebook ads to determine the positioning by generating statistically significant data. using ads for growth experiments is different from using ads as acquisition channels. key takeaways if you are a new company, stay away from paid ads. improve product and positioning, build a repository of user research and build as many organic channels of growth as possible. use ads for growth experiments if required. that's all! let me know what are your thoughts on these points related to notion's organic growth. also if you happen to find out something more, do share.","146":"hi, anyone here using a chatbot for their saas landing page? what are you using? what do you like about it? and what do

i suppose we could build this into our application logic and store that information in a database. it just seems like there should be a plugin that works like intercom or something, where it recognizes which user just logged in, checks if they've agreed to the latest version, and if not prompts them to agree. that way updating the language would be as simple as creating a new version in this hypothetical tool. and storing an audit trail of when each user signed each version would be useful as well. right now they agree when they sign up but our billing system doesn't affirmatively store that information, its just a required field on the checkout form. any suggestions on how to manage this?

maybe it's not what i mentally interested in? we created a spreadsheet with the formula that allows estimating your ideas and pick up the right one. we listed 15 parameters that any idea can be estimated with. each parameter has its own weight and participates in the common formula. the result is based on the influence of every parameter. our ideal product has a scrore 454 points. real products have much fewer points. it's probably not a good idea to compare real products with an ideal one but you can compare real products each with others to pick up a product with a higher score. these parameters are 1. how easy to find first clients - it's critically you will able find first adopters as fast as possible. 2. how easy to create a first working version - if it's very hard to create a working product we will subtract points instead of adding. 3. if it requires making regular content - all the product require creating at least marketing content but it's better when it's not required for the product itself 4. if it requires a lot of content as a product - better not to be dependant on the content volume 5. if i know the subject well and can create content easily and with a pleasure - you shouldn't pick the idea if you are unfamiliar with the subject 6. target audience - it will be harder to work with a smaller audience but a niche audience is good . 7. is it easy to validate an idea - a landing page, survey, several phone calls or emails - if it's enough, it's good, else... don't pick the idea 8. it's rather a program or service , but not a content website , weight = 2 - we are fans of programs than content web sites. 9. if i'm interested in the subject - it's hard to work on something that you are really not interested in. 10. will i have a personal profit from it - you have a chance to eat your own dog food and get profit from it. 11. how many competitors - it's not good if there are no competitors at all or too many of them - so subtract in this cases, else add. 12. vitamin or pain killer - pain killer is always better. 13. if it uses interesting, cool, modern technologies\/approaches - it may distract you but the point is you can use it as a good marketing trick. 14. do i have an idea how to monetize the product - having a good plan of monetization is always better. we also recommend asking people if they are ready to pay during your validation process. 15. how easy for others is to clone the product - if a product is easy to clone, maybe it's better to stay away from it. another way to avoid competition is to pick up a narrow niche. you can find the spreadsheet with the formula here find the additional explanations here please let us know what you think! did you find this approach useful?

ex if i had a cloud-based storage product, obviously google drive and dropbox are already solving that problem. but if i had a unique take on that , would i try to lead with those other unique features or would i have similar positioning to them focusing on the same general problem\/benefit we help you access your stuff anywhere, anytime, on all devices?

showing their product in action. would you use something like the video recording function of puppeteer\/cypress?","229":"the creation of any website requires understanding of the future users needs, well-thought-out content, web design, and testing, but the task is particularly tricky for saas companies. in order to make a successful saas, to attract customers, and show how good your product is, offer a trial . also, if you want to convert more visitors into users, dont forget about the web page structure and optimization. when compared to other business models, the success of software as a service to a greater extent relies on the engaging potential of its website. landing pages are particularly important for saas companies because of their amazing conversion potential. a landing page design for saas must complement its brand while giving exactly what the target audience is looking for. a strong value proposition and call to action above the folder of the landing page remain the staples in saas designs. include eye-catching images, animations and videos as illustrations of the product and\/or as social proof, but emphasize the cta. a well-designed and seo-friendly home and landing pages can help your saas business overcome the marketing challenge. i can share with you a few useful tips when developing or redesigning your website. can you add anything?","230":"our saas

signup page or webinar marketing techniques that will push non users to sign up for the webinar. i know copywriting plays a major role in this but at the moment if i can focus on bringing traffic and let my product do the talking, i won't have to worry about copywriting as much because the niche i'm in is not that competitive. i have already tried to market the webinar on twitter but that didn't work because my company twitter account has hardly any followers and the hashtag\/meme strategy didn't work. the email lists that i have are of users that are already using my product. i know ppc can be utilised but the cons of bootstrapping a business is that there's only so much that you can allocate for marketing spend. so before i spend on ppc or even raise money to spend on ppc or to hire someone to do those campaigns, i want to exhaust all the organic methods of marketing a webinar. can anyone suggest some non-traditional ways of marketing a webinar that might've worked for them?","232":"often founders ask the question that they have a working product in hand but they don't know what to do next. this is a very interesting phase where you have a product in hand and you are excited to launch it. but this phase can turn out to be a nightmare. the core idea here is to start small and scale. at denovers define your features and the problem you are solving in a decent and summarized way. feature some customer testimonials. you can share your product with friends and family for free to get some early feedback as well as testimonials to feature. have a pricing table with a clear cta. faqs section closure cta of get a demo integrate google analytics. dont worry about all the kpis, just focus on the number of users per day, demographics, and acquisition and you are good to go. create an account on calendly and embed its link over all the get a demo ctas. bonus install inspectlet or hotjar. this will help you in visualizing the user journey and to know whats working and whats not. identify your user & buyer persona often founders make mistakes by considering user and buyer personas as one. at this stage, its super important to know who exactly will write a cheque for your product and who will use it. in most cases, its one but in some cases, these are two different personas. gear up for sales aka cold outreach this is important. now you have a product, a sales landing page, and buyer personas in hand. gear up for sales now. the first and important step is to directly reach your ideal prospects. go to angel dot co, 500 startups, etc, and find your ideal companies. track all of them on google sheets. use any of the email finding apps to find email addresses. craft a short and to the point pitch addressing how you will be solving the problem with a clear cta. just do a basic google search and you will get tons of articles on how to write cold emails. remember one thing, always prefer customization and quality over the quantity. research your ideal prospect and customize your pitch accordingly. start hanging out on communities i am sure you have subject matter expertise on any one topic, ideally, the one you have build a product around. start hanging out on communities like reddit, hacker news, indie hackers, etc. remember these communities operate on a two-way model. you have to give to take back. again, a basic google search about each of them would help you a lot. launch on product hunt now you are fully prepared for a product hunt launch. prepare for it in advance but dont take forever to launch. if not sales, you will get pretty good feedback with your ph lunch as the community over there is very supportive. start thinking long term aka content marketing its the right time to think big and for the long term. build a basic wordpress blog on your website or a publication on medium and start writing content around your niche. things you have done before have given you a pretty decent idea of what you should write about. create a basic content calendar and start producing content. you can hire good freelance writers as well. remember, invest the same amount of time in distributing the content the amount of time you are investing in writing it. thats super important. invest in good design there is a reason companies invest a fortune in design. good user experience will enhance the chances of conversion by 10x. try to improvise your product user experience. at we believe design is just not about how your product looks like, but its about how it behaves in your users hands. identify & scale until now you have tried different approaches. now take a step back and analyze the results. measure different kpis and see whats working and whats not. and when you find your sweet spot, just scale it 10x. conclusion running a startup is difficult and fun at the same time. instead of the result, you have to fall in love with the process of getting success. trust me, once you are in it, you will like to repeat it again and again. there is a reason serial entrepreneurs start multiple companies again and again in their careers. you will do the same, just fall in love with the process. i

intention to sell, but now that the idea is in my head it's something i'm strongly considering. we've only sent a few emails back and forth and i have a call scheduled to talk discuss the possibility with them further. it's only an introductory discussion, but i'm wondering how i should prepare for talk or if there's anything i should be aware of? as a first-time, solo business owner i feel pretty inexperienced and my main concern is getting taken advantage of or just acting naive about the process. am i suppose to have a figure in my head that i'd be okay selling the company for right away? it also feels too early in the process to research\/find a lawyer to get involved since its only an introductory discussion. any insight\/tips at all on how to approach this or resources that have helped

expenses are primarily advertising. - 1 employee . - spend about 15 hours a week working on the business. - coded it myself, so its very messy and not sure it would be easily transfered. not sure how

locations, one in the u.s.a., one in eu, and one in canada, since some canadian companies require that. but this brings extra complexities to deployment, testing, maintenance, etc., since you have to do everything almost identical 3 times. and if you plan to even more markets, add that number. is there a better way to reduce this repetitivity? like some kind of infrastructure which allows you to

customers who stayed with the company after a specific period. in the vast majority of cases, it is a major indicator of health in a software business. customer churn rate the kpi measures the number of customers or accounts leaving the service within a specific time frame as a percentage of the overall customer count. customer satisfaction score csat measures the overall level of a users content or discontent about individual interactions with your company, e.g., using a new product or service feature or conversation with customer support. monthly recurring revenue and related saas kpis it is

thanks!","246":"feeling pretty discouraged after running ads this month, tried switching up my on boarding process, adjusting pricing, landing page, but nothing seems to be helping.. looking forward to seeing some responses!","247":"when you are starting up, its very easy to get lost in a lot of details and stressing over small trivial things. at this stage, its super important to keep things simple & stupid. the same goes for the landing page. at denovers i have worked with a lot of b2b founders by designing their saas & app products. often we see those founders getting worried about the copy. writing & developing a landing page for your saas or any product seems to be difficult but it isnt. with literally a zero background, you can come up with a basic but finished landing page with optimized conversions just in a day. for this, i will map writing a landing page copy with a framework called aida. aida stands for attention, interest, desire, and action; it is an eminent marketing model in terms of advertising, copywriting, and content paradigms in general. this particular hierarchal model breaks down the step-by-step process of the user journey, from the point they visit your site until the purchase is made. lets start exploring the magic. attention aka hero section of the landing page come up with a clear, captivating & attention-grabbing headline with a clear value proposition on the hero section of the landing page. dont try to come up with your own terminologies, instead, try to relate with your user. see what problems solutions they are searching for and try to add them as a keyword in your headline. ideally, capture emails in the hero section too along with a cta. according to marketing experiments research, over 90% of visitors who reported reading headlines also read cta copy. interest aka how it works now you have got their attention, its time to create some interest. tell your user in a decent and precise way the problem you are addressing and how you solve it. having 3 to 5 steps of how it works can also work like a charm over here. desire aka flaunt customer testimonials once interest is created, its the right time to flaunt some customer testimonials to ignite the desire in your customers mind. let them know how you have solved the pain points of others, bringing them the transformation they needed. this will, in return, hit them on the subconscious level how well you can do it for them as well. if you are just starting and dont have enough customer testimonials, share your product with friends and family for free. this will not only get you some testimonials, but it will also help you in getting early feedback which is really crucial at this stage. action aka pricing with a clear cta well done, you have got your readers attention, have sparked interest and desire in them. now its time for an action. guide them with a clear call to action. have a super clear lucid pricing table with clear cta. its up to you what you want them to do, maybe you want them to start a free trial? or you want them to contact us? or book a demo with the sales team? whatever the goal is, make it clear. adding an explanatory faq section, in the end, will play a major role in eradicating all concerns and ambiguities in the readers mind bonus test & iterate testing on regular basis is super important. again, there is no need to get lost in a lot of details. just do these two things install google analytics & hotjar. this will help you in visualizing your users journey and to know whats working and whats not and then will eventually help you in doing rapid iterations, as they say. at there are some cases where i added a dialog box in the conversion flow which improvised conversions by 10x. conclusion coming up with the first copy of your landing page with a high conversion goal is fairly easy. you just need to understand the value you are providing and translate it in a simple way as possible. aida framework will not only help you in writing landing pages, but it can be applied easily to writing newsletters, ad copies, headlines, etc. need some help?

part of the solution is knowing the problem you are hiring for. having been a people manager for a couple of years, i wanted to highlight what i believe are important factors... share your experience, please throwing more bodies at a problem will not solve it faster. in my previous job, as my boss and i were hiring a second person to join me in sales, she told me that hiring another me wouldnt double the sales output. this isnt to say that im better or more productive than whoever was to join our team, but that with new and more people there will be new layers of inefficiencies, such as admin work, training, misunderstandings and so on. to avoid slowing down the growth of the business when new people are joining, its important to have a clear onboarding and training plan if not, new starters will be spending much longer learning the job. know the problem you are hiring for. if an organisation is struggling with sales, hiring more sales people may be the completely wrong approach. taking the time to investigate and identify whats stopping sales can reveal problems you didnt know of. for example, customers might be unhappy with the product you are making in which case, the solution to more sales could be hiring someone to improve the user experience. poor behaviour is contagious. at work were part of a team and were reliant on each other. if colleagues are just doing the bare minimum, constantly complaining about their job, or in general have a bad attitude, they will bring the rest of their team down. their lack of responsibility and integrity will spread like a disease to colleagues they will see that poor behaviour is accepted, and will be less motivated to work hard. hire only fully formed adults who take responsibility for themselves and their team members. honest feedback. do you have some colleagues that have poor, demoralising or ineffective habits that really annoy you? the truth is that it probably annoys a lot of other people too, and they are probably not aware of their habits themselves, as no one has ever told them. whether its constant late comings, demoralising comments, ineffective work or anything else, its impeding growth and we do everyone a favour by giving them honest feedback. enable and empower people closest to the problem. senior executives and manager are often not aware of everyday challenges of the business, such as poor customer experience or malfunctioning systems. the doers those who code software, speak to customers and welcome people in the reception must be empowered to report internally when somethings not working right, and enabled to fix and improve the situation themselves. that can be something as simple as giving them admin rights to a specific software, so they can log in and correct whats not right. this post was originally posted on danielsblog.substack.com.","279":"hi everyone, i am a ciso of 1k company in the medical world. during the last two months i am exploring how you are as customers, making sure that your saas accounts are protected?

also can you recommend a tech stack with following criteria based on your own experience - easy to learn and code as solo project from frontend to backend - easy to maintain, operate and to scale as demand grows - as secure as possible out of box with little hassle - offers a lot of plugins for max reuse - lowest cost possible any language or framework. i looked at some low code no code and the costs seem pretty expensive. but let me know if you know of a cheap one. thank you !","346":"we are building a product in aws and as you might know there are certain cost like data transfer and time of running certain instances that might need to be transfer to the customers through the price of our product. i find very tricky to have clear tiers for pricing with those variables as there might be some items that are not related to the product itself. it's annoying enough that we will have to build features for customers to track that information. on the other hand, if we leave it out of the equation we can get a huge bill to pay that we won't charge to the customers and that's not an option. i've found that some products actually mention those details in their tiers pricing but i guess it creates some barriers as it's kind of difficult for clients to estimate the usage of those variable items - at least it's for us that we are building the tool and using aws. on top of that it might not cover all the scenarios if the variables are fixed like if we offer storage of 20gb and they want 100gb. so the pricing model there might require apply some options that will be charge extra on top of the default. a solution that i saw, but still doesn't convince me, is to give the concept of credits to customers and they can manage their budget. the problem with that is that we will be taking the heat if they screwed up by spending their credits mostly in items that are not related to our product like data transfer for example. how do other people in this sub transfer those fees to customers? should i just assume that customer for my product have to be savvy enough to estimate those costs and provide those variables in the pricing? is there an easier way to handle these type of situations?","347":"i need to redesign one of my sites that is a saas and wanted to hear your shoutouts of sites that you love or ones you think are worth paying attention to. i know it goes without saying the biggest companies probably spend the most time and money on conversion rate optimization so hoping to get some suggestions of sites i've not seen or heard of before.","348":"hey all, its a struggle for startups to find and then validate high-quality employees. are there any services that youre particularly happy to work with for this kind of job?

for example, lets say we are charging $1 per mb used, per month..or $1 per mbps used, per month...would it be an estimate and not a quote? does a customer issue a purchase order, if so how would that work, since again it is consumption based?

product\/services to customers all across the world. . 1. use stripe + sales tax solution like taxjar \/ avalara \/ quarderno. 2. use a merchant of record like paddle or gumroad which handles payment + sales tax + tax filling. i have a question about option 1, specifically how do people handle tax filling? it seems like from what i've researched people who have done option 1 are only filing taxes in the country they are operating from. so if they from us, then they are mostly concern they're collecting taxes for folks buying anywhere within the 50 states and i presume they are filling using their accountant. same goes if the saas business is operated from europe, they seem mostly concern of handling vat taxes but don't appear to be concerned about collecting\/filling us taxes. i presume most regular accountants are equipped for filing taxes for the country they're in, not for the entire world, unless of course, they deal with accountants from the big 4, which i doubt people most people here are doing. what am i missing\/not getting? 1. are those sales tax solutions handling tax filing as well? 2. are there accountants\/services that handles tax filing for the wherever a sales is done? 3. you don't really have to care about foreign tax filling? or not care about tax filling aside from us and europe? basically if you go for option 1, how are you handling tax filing for sales coming from anywhere in the world? p.s. i get that option 2 is very much preferred and the added cost is nothing to fret about. i wish to understand how people remain compliant via option 1.","381":"i

series called startup funding explained. we went through a theoretical companys story while analyzing how the cap table evolved through various rounds of funding. this article will analyze a few exit scenarios for that theoretical company and how much money everyone does, or does not make. to give credit to everyone involved, a lot of the topics covered here were way beyond my expertise so steve barsh from dreamit ventures helped me put these estimations together. in a nutshell, heres where the company is at, raised a seed round of funding through a convertible note. raised a series a round of funding, which valued the company at $10mm. the investors on the series a negotiated a liquidation preference that guarantees them 2x the capital invested. a series a round would probably have additional terms, but we are trying to keep it simple for the article purposes. we also had two option pools, the first one with a strike price per share of $0.0312500 and the second one with a strike price per share of $1. if some of this stuff doesnt make sense, again, check out the third episode of startup funding explained on slidebean's youtube. lets look at the cap table founder 1 4,000,000 33.96% founder 2 1,500,000 12.74% friends & family investor 2,000,000 16.98% employee 1 250,000 2.12% employee 2 250,000 2.12% convertible note investor 500,000 4.25% option pool 2 500,000 4.25% series a investors 2,777,778 23.58% now we will go over two scenarios a rescue acquisition or acqui-hire and a strategic exit for the company. lets get to it! scenario 1 an acqui-hire lets say this company started struggling soon after the round. it has managed to stay afloat, but its not growing very much. the company might seek out a buyer that has an interest in taking profits out of the business. there are some holding companies or funds that purchase saas companies and are very good at monetizing them. a saas company usually operates on a 7585% gross margin . the remaining costs are support staff, technical\/product team for new features and maintenance, and the operational costs office, accounting, etc. these holding companies acquire multiple saas companies and have centralized, shared operations, accounting, legal, developers, and support. these resources are shared across all the saas companies in the holding company to squeeze a lot more profit than the company can do independently. they are not buying the business for strategic reasons. they are buying it to earn profits from it, so the acquisition price will probably be a 1x to 2x multiple of their revenue. another common scenario is for a company to absorb the team and perhaps a patent or a brand name. in those cases, some price references are $1mm per engineer, or merely enough to give investors a 1x return on their investment so that they can greenlight the deal. if you think the $1mm per engineer sounds like a lot, it may not be. if the average base salary in nyc or silicon valley is $130,000 per engineer, and you could hire a team of 5 or 6 engineers who have worked together for years and are a highly efficient team, the price may not be crazy. in particular, if this is an acqui-hire at a very low purchase price, the engineers employee stock options may be worthless if they are underwater. >underwater means the startups price per share at acquisition is below the stock option strike price for the options the engineers have. so the stock options are worthless and the acquirer is giving an incentive for the engineers to stay on. note that the $1mm per engineer may involve a retention component to make sure the engineers dont just get the $1mm at closing and then walk out the door. again, none of these acquisitions are very exciting, but they can provide a soft-landing for the team and some liquidity for investors. there can be an inherent tension here as sometimes the founders are more interested in retention bonuses for the team while, on the other hand, investors are more interested in cash for the stock. often there is a lot of negotiation that takes place around these points. long-story short, lets say our theoretical business with a $12.5 mm post-money valuation after the last round gets an offer for $12mm. so the first thing we will get with that is a price per share. we had 11,777,778- so a $12mm offer means $1.019 per share. however, we have to start with that liquidation preference. series a investors need to get a 2x multiplier on their original investment, and convertible note investors too . so out of that $12mm, we will take $5mm for the series a investors and $1mm for the convertible note investors . thats $6mm that effectively bought out the preferred shares, which leaves us with $6mm for the rest of the shares . that is $6mm divided by 8,500,000 shares for an effective $0.7058 per share. but were not done yet. we have to do a small parenthesis about stock options. stock options stock options are options to buy shares at a specific strike price. they are designed that way for two reasons, 1. when they are issued, the person who receives them doesnt have any tax implications. since they are not receiving the actual shares, they dont have to pay tax on them. 2. the employee receiving them is motivated to increase the value of the company. if the companys price per share doesnt grow, the stock options are not worth anything. lets say an employee has 1,000 stock options at a strike price of $1. if the company gets acquired for $2 per share, they can effectively execute their stock options and then sell them for double the price, which the acquirer is paying. so 1,000 stock options bought for $1 each, sold for $2 each, theres a net earning of $1,000. great! employee stock options have a lot of moving parts. when structuring stock option plans make sure to have accountants and lawyers working with you who have a ton of experience with this. if your aunt or uncle is an attorney and largely handles divorces or personal injury cases and says im happy to help you, say no thanks. if this is not done correctly, a poorly structured stock option plan can have devastating consequences. from vesting schedules to cliffs, to how long to exercise after separation and how long until options expire. expiring options can be a big issue at companies that stay private longer, like uber and airbnb, where employee stock options may expire if it takes too long for the company to get acquired or go public. if the stock options are going to expire employees may have to come out of pocket and put money down to actually exercise and buy out the stock options so they can get the actual stock before the option expires. now looking at our scenario, youll see the problem. the second stock option pool this company offered has a strike price of $1. the price per share for this acquisition after paying the liquidation preference is $0.70. its not worth buying shares to resell them for less. so we can assume that the second stock option pool doesnt get executed. that means the company only has 8,000,000 shares to sell. at 8,000,000 shares, we have a slightly higher price of $0.75 per share. and that is the price well be using. cap table founder 1 4,000,000 founder 2 1,500,000 friends & family investor 2,000,000 employee 1 250,000 employee 2 250,000 founder 1 sells 4,000,000 shares at 0.75 effectively getting $3m. founder 2 gets $1.125m for the shares they vested. friends and family investor gets $1.5m, a significant 30x multiplier on their investment. not bad at all! the employees that hold stock option pools have to buy their shares. they have 500,000 shares total, which they purchase at the strike price of $0.023, so they have to pay $11,500 for them. simultaneously, however, they sell them for $0.75 each, which gives them earnings of $0.727 per share. since each of the two imaginary employees had 250,000 shares, they get profits of $181,750. not bad. or is it? if they had been working at the startup for several years and had taken a below-market salary in hopes of getting rich from the stock options and over 3 years got another $180k in taxable cash maybe the $60k per year was a small win but not totally life-changing. all that money is, of course, subject to taxes. so be prepared to take a chunk out of it. if you are a foreign founder, not registered as a us taxpayer, its going to be a flat 30%. and thats that. scenario 2 lets look at the second scenario, a sexy acquisition. lets say the company gets bought for $35mm. in this case, the price per share would be a very sweet $2.972. the liquidation preference clause doesnt apply in this case since the price per share guarantees these investors a 2x return. the math here is a lot easier. the number of shares owned by each shareholder, multiplied by $2.972. now interestingly enough, a $35m acquisition sounds like an amazing deal for the founders. the founder who stuck around is getting an $11m exit, which certainly changes anyones life. even the second option pool of employees is getting gains of $1.972 per share. they will need to virtually pay $500,000 to buy those shares but get $1.485m in exchange for them. remember, this is a cashless transaction, so the option pool holders dont actually have to buy the stock options, they just get the difference in price. but the investors, not so much. they are getting a 3x return on their investment, which is good, but certainly not what venture capital investors are in for. the success rate of tech companies is low, so investors are looking for the big whale, the big 10x return that makes up for all the companies that didnt work out. this company is making up for 3. this directly connects to a common question i get from founders, around business valuation, and even around the type of company that can raise venture capital. even this pretty successful company, getting acquired for $35m, is a meh story for its investors. if you intend to raise venture capital you need to have a clear path to that $100mm or more valuation. now you understand why, hopefully.","389":"i guess its mostly a question for more experienced business owners but when

well be launching our closed beta in august, with the plan to launch in full to paying clients a month or two later. thanks!","451":"i'm wondering how do entrepreneurs in different industries manage their bookkeeping ? do they do it themselves or have someone do it for them? i'll go first , i give self development tips online and there's not much work as for bookkeeping ,so i do it myself.","452":"i know this is a very general question and i could probably find scattered answers throughout the community. but id like to have this post dedicated to defining problems. the reason for the post is mainly to see how i can be of most help\/value and be of service in the future in the saas industry. ive noticed a lot of companies struggle with optimizing their acquisition methods which usually just comes down to not understanding the underlying factors that play into successful digital campaigns of any sort. id like to help solve problems related to this. specifically for saas companies . my background is in marketing and have helped companies in various industries with their marketing and client\/user acquisition. initially i started by helping my dads company here in vegas generate more inquiries for high ticket luxury fireplaces and garage doors. i started with the website, did seo for it, ranked locally at the top, ran google ads for the different products, etc. i ended up generating too much demand for them to handle with just over 50 employees . they told me to shut down the stuff that was creating the demand and i actually went as far as increasing friction points anyways, fast forward a few months and im trying to help with internal efficiency issues since they told me to shut down my science experiment . there was some butting heads within the company on how certain things should be handled and by whom. and although i desperately wanted to help them scale up and generate more revenue in whatever ways i could, i just couldnt get management to agree on stuff . so i found an itch for making stuff more efficient during that time both with marketing\/sales and internally . this led me to pursue my own endeavors doing similar things but for other companies . fast forward to now, ive become passionate and curious about digital marketing, tech, customer psych, machine learning and many other areas that i wish i had the time to dive deeper into. thats how i found saas companies that are doing awesome things that can scale if they make tweaks to their approaches regarding marketing and sales and just overall acquisition methods\/approaches. so, here i am now looking for ways i can help in any way if you guys are open to posting about about areas youre struggling with or would like to get feedback on. please post your problem areas below. also, the more defined the problem is and the more information i have regarding any of the following - icp - price point - stage of the company - approaches\/channels that are \/ were working for what objectives - approaches\/channels that havent worked - areas of trouble within the funnel the better answer ill likely be able to give as a majority of you probably already know. before posting, lots of people ive met with think they have a lead \/ traffic volume problem when in reality, they have a quality problem. id love to dive deeper into that if thats something any of you would like more depth on. but i dont want to expound if thats not something anyone is struggling with thanks in advance for your questions and comments! hope this post is helpful! also if youd like to read a bit more about the psychometric ai company and how i helped generate more leads \/ users for them, ill throw the link in the comments. basically what we found was that using tests\/quizzes that spit out personalized recommendations for them are far more likely to be considered since its personalized and based on their answers to the quiz. part of this is the fact that theres no pressure for product consideration, they do it at their pace, they can back out at any time and just exit the browser they were taking the quiz on, and they know they arent being sold something dont want or need since its based on their input\/answers.","453":"hi folks i built a product in 2008 called yuml that helps students draw computer science diagrams by simply typing text. 64% of our audience are students, the rest are software professionals. about 300 people register each month, of about 6,000 who use the product. but very very few buy it. i built it for fun and it's great that people get value from it. but it costs more to run than it makes in revenue, so i need to either fix that or try and sell it to someone who can do better. i'm concerned that a product aimed at students is going to be hard to monetise?

training or prep work of any kind with management, but i wanted to come as prepared as i can be. it will be a very informal format and i suppose i can ask any questions i want, but do you have a process you use? would love to know. thanks.","520":"i work for a vehicle tracking company where we are struggling to get users to use more features. that said we do have a low churn rate . our customers use the basic functionality , but even though they understand that the added value of the other features they simply don't use it. often times it is a selling point for us, but in the end the majority of them simply don't use it due to not having someone in place to do this, or because they don't have the time to organize this. i understand many people and companies aren't very organized, but still for us it is frustrating that the other features are hardly used. any ideas?","521":"long story short, i work at a small to mid tier saas firm in the boston area and the investors are running it into the ground. they refuse to pay anybody what theyre worth and now, because management finds a way to disrespect or yell at everybody , 6 people have quit or are resigning by the end of the week since the beginning of the year. now, my direct report is talking about promoing me. im a sr sdr currently, slaying quotas every month with almost 1 mil in pipeline. ive been here 1.5 years in october, and they want to make me an sdr manager while i continue to call on enterprise accounts. cool. i actually love making cold calls. been a manager before. liked that too. thing is, faang is offering a lot of money for l4 sales positions that i feel im qualified for. i have an aws ccp cert and im working on my saa c02 now. so, i know i can make 120-140k somewhere if i look hard enough. help me be unreasonable. if they want to promote me and keep me, how much should i tell them im worth? ball is in my court now that theyve already announced their intentions. i feel like 175 ote with a 110 base seems like where id want to settle. tell them 190? more? less? what do you think? yoe 6 in sales, including 1 year management","522":"can a single person do all things for saas

content development like video tutorials, courses, how-to videos, etc for customers at large companies like microsoft, tableau, alteryx, uipath, etc. also, do they outsource video production?","524":"i'm having trouble determining the best route here. i'm building a little fundraising platform, somewhere between gofundme, patreon, and buymeacoffee. the users don't have businesses for the most part, they aren't selling any products, they don't have websites, they're likely varying levels of tech savviness. i'm between stripe connect express accounts and stripe connect standard accounts. i'm leaning toward standard because the burden of refunds, chargebacks, and fraud would fall on the user to manage. however, the onboarding and dashboard are much more in depth and clearly made for people familiar with stripe or possibly have businesses already. express seems simpler and dumbed down , but then i have to manage things like refunds for my users and i'm on the hook for fraud which i'm not even sure how to prevent. plus both types ask a lot of details about the users business even though they don't have one. how did you handle this?","525":"hi, we started last year with 3 co-founders but one of the co-founders left. still on good terms, he was just too busy. their experience in jobs was business development and sales. this created a gap that has since been filled by myself and other co-founder. we're making progress, have a steady mrr, pmf has been achieved, and we're just dialing in our sales processes. i have heard the term sales playbook thrown around. this seems like a good idea, and i'm in the process of putting one together. basically, we want to hire our first team member and have them come into a very established role. to the founders we have a good inbound lead flow , understand our customers well, and know how to take them from stranger to customer. what was helpful when putting together official documentation on the sales process, so you could train someone else? how many sales rep came on? was it base+commission?","526":"hello community. i'm currently working on a lead generation saas and trying to find initial traction by talking about it on various platforms. while doing so i came across various lifetime deal platforms like appsumo, dealify, etc. as a buyer what do you feel about saas lifetime deals? has anyone ever bought one and used the product for the long run?","527":"so, i have listened to this advice many times - to focus on a market and then find the problems in the market by contacting the people who work in it. so, i wanted to know is there some list of such markets maybe specifically for saas businesses? and how do you know if some market would be good for a saas business? thank you.","528":"i am being recruited by a company that is tail end of series b ~$30m raised. theyre looking to bring me in to do business development ops. my role will be building out the sales processes for future bdr hires while having the option to go the management or ae route. they mention theyre gunning for unicorn status but other than a billion dollar valuation it seems like these are being thrown to people left and right.","529":"hello, i am thinking about doing a producthunt launch for my b2b saas product soon and was wondering how effective it was for other saas owners. was there any type of increase in traffic? how many signups did you get, and how many paying customers did you acquire from your launch? also, any tips on the launch would be greatly appreciated. if you are okay with hunting my product, please pm me! thanks.","530":"if you could go back to your 18 year old self with the goal of starting your own saas, how would you go about it? study in university? start your own company immediately? work at a startup? i'm 19 and looking for advice. thanks.","531":"over the past few months, for generating leads for my saas product web vuln

recommendations would be appreciated!","532":"i'm building a saas that customers integrate into their application's code. if my infrastructure goes down, it will negatively impact their applications and potentially their customers. for something like this, how do you make uptime guarantees and how do you handle liability for impacting your customer's product?","533":"am wondering what everyone uses for payments or to integrate payments into their saas? any good or bad experiences? thanks in advance!","534":"it is a common functionality for just every saas, so how do you solve the authentication and registration task? how do you prevent bots and temporary email registration, and what do you do to prevent fraud?","535":"i've seen products with very few upvotes and comments trend on ph as the 2 or 3 product of the day. whereas some products with even more upvotes and comments not trend at all. anybody here has cracked how the ph algorithm works? some insights from your experience will be super useful.","536":"i come from a mix of tech and design background, and so i know enough to be the cto of sorts, and handle the built out of the basic site function\/design, but i cannot code anything being low level javascript. ultimately i would love someone to build it and split the profits with, but i do not know anyone like this, nor would i want to insult anyone by even suggesting that they work for free. the point is, is this dumb for any reason? or have any of you had any level of success doing this? would love any tips. thanks","537":"i'm looking for both b2c & b2b.","538":"hello everyone! i'm building a small saas in the food area, and i'm trying to figure out a scalable way to validate that the user that's creating an account for his business is actually the business owner. currently, i'm doing it manually i do a little chatting and a small research about the business, then i mark the created account as a valid account, but i'm afraid that this will scale poorly. for example, one way i thought about doing it was to get the owner's email from google apis and then send a confirmation email with a link for validation, but unfortunately, as far as i know, google does not share this kind of information.","539":"several months ago, i started to learn about online privacy of data and after learning about how some companies handle our data, i was concerned, sot i was trying everything i could to protect my data online, but there were several apps on which i couldn't protect my data and one of the apps were about social media, i was using them all day and i was spending most of my time on them, but they are data hungry apps that want as much personal data as they can, so i thought it didn't matter to protect my data as much because even if i try everything, i can't protect my data from social media and that's how i got the idea for this social media. i have a friend who also liked this idea, but we need feedback from people so that we can be sure that people want this so that we can start our startup. the platform name is ciao, it is a social media app in which your favorite content creators can upload most type of their digital content , etc. on the platform, which means you can get all of their content in one place rather than just clicking on bio to get that content or to search about their content on different platform. you can also buy products either digital or physical products from your favorite content creators on the platform itself. this social media doesnt have any ads which means, it is focused on your privacy of data. you have complete control over your data and not us or anyone. as i said earlier, we are not including any ads, which means the business pages will always get highest amount of engagement forever. we are also focused on minimizing spams as much as possible because they makes the user experience worse & that spam includes, fake accounts, fake information, fake followers, fake likes, fake comments and specially bots, etc. we have a future vision for this app, we want to create a vr world in which every user can use a vr device to connect to the world and they can meet their friends online, play games with them, talk to them, buy products either digital or physical and travel the world with them. we need your feedback on this survey ","540":"chartmogul seems to be a very common tool for saas owners, but i really don't see the extreme value that it adds. is it just a really good analytics program? i'm not trolling, i'm sincerely interested.","541":"curious what the

day? i know this will depend on the type of service but i want to set some targets and want to know if i should be targeting 1, 10, 100 customers a day? finally, what is an acceptable conversion rate - i.e. new lead to paying customer? thanks!","2":"what do you do roll your own billing\/charging method, or use an external service? i'm at the last stage of building my saas before going live the payment and billing processor, but i'm in a hurry i don't know what to do, if externalise it completely, using a full stack payment company like avangate, or roll my own method using stripe for charging credit cards, allowing people to send money directly via wire transfers and use the eu sepa for direct debit . my service will be targeted mainly to spanish users, and spanish users are very used to pay recurring fees using sepa direct debit, so allowing people to pay with sepa direct debit is a must for my business. also, the people whom i've talked, like the idea of paying yearly using a simple wire transfer, and well, i'm really used about creating invoices, the eu vat laws, etc... but, on the other side, this is a lot of work that must be designed , developed, tested, etc... and if i use a full stack payment provider like avangate teorically it should be easier... but not flexible as my own code... so, any suggestions about which way to follow? do you have bad or good

wrong... please educate me. my company is pivoting from consulting to product. i am writtng that story for reddit start ups, but i had a question for this forum. we have a hyper graphdatabase, in short patternspace, is a database that allows you to aggregate any type of data in a distributed environment that stores data not in tables, like a relational way, but in a graphical manner. using an advanced graphical model, patternspace has introduced a hypergraph which include the use of hyperedges - allowing for sets of data to be related to other sets of data, which previously could not have been done in standard graph databases. this allows companies to explore, and relate data in an infinite number of ways compared to being constrained to ridged data relationships like traditional database stores or the standard limitations of graph databases. by the organization of data in a hypergraph and the advanced way it relates data, you will find patterns and value in your data that have innumerable benefits to businesses, such as predicitive insights for your product and customers, and improved efficiencies in operations. i can go into more tech if you like... so my question, how do you demo backend services like this? i have something in place that is working, but i wondered if anyone had any other ideas? i am trying to stay away from powerpoints, currently im using case

hint its not statistics its not statisticalat least not pure statistics. this post is not one to give you the formula or the mathematical explanation of why this correlates to that. this post is more about feeling and less about thinking. more about communicating and more about intuition. it is in line with my previous articles. for context, i advocate for getting in touch 1-on-1 with your user, even though its not scalable. at the same time, i advocate for not asking people what do they think about your product. if its amazing or dreadful, they will vent it outmore so on the latter. if its in the middle, theyll be silent. it doesnt mean its boring, it can just mean it didnt cause any feelingstheres room to expand on creating an experience. the answer when users go out of their way to say thank you, thats when you know theyre a true fan. they dont always have time to do that, they dont always feel comfortable with striking a conversation out of nowhere or they might think it doesnt make a difference if i say thank you. some do and youll get a message in your inbox. however, heres the thing if youd go out and reach out to them, it doesnt take a long time for anyone to write hey, didnt ever think of writing to you but your product helped us a lot. thats a sentence as a reply email. those are what kevin kelly called true fansand his article about reaching out. the idea is that it has such a bigger impact if done. what would you rather talk about? the ceo of shake shack that sent you an email or jeff bezos divorce? something that happened within your vicinity or a bigger event that youre not really connected with? number 4 , giving more than they expected. hey, thanks for paying in full for a year. heres one extra month, just because were grateful. and that doesnt mean you need to lose money. its like the white gloves service or the insurance business. its like the dropped macaron pricing that i mentioned a few weeks ago. if i know im paying for 10 pieces, youve made the price so as to account for 11 pieces and then you say heres a free one, itll have a much much bigger impact. its like a surprise, like santa claus. its true, i wont cry of happiness or even care in an hour that your company gave me more. but it did matter for those.5 seconds or 5 seconds. > objection yes, daniel, but how many more am i losing because i increased, basically, my price? to which id answer those 0.5 to 5 seconds of gratitude, even if it happens to 2 people out of 10 , youre still about to win. youre about to win because thats how relationship building works, thats how brand building is happening and thats how these motherfuckers will tell other grateful motherfuckers about it and youre about to create a true network\/circle of people who are using your stuff. the conclusion be good, for goodness sake. and itll come back to you, even if it looks like a cost today. however, all these ideas are easier to implement for some and harder for others. i said this in an interview the other dayits easier to give out and to expect nothing help people get off the ground be in the position of for those who win, more will be given as opposed to for those who have nothing, everything will be taken when your mental is strong. when insecurities and negative emotions are acknowledged, when neediness is not present and when theres internal peace. but hey, thats outside the scope of measuring user churn. the conclusion in a nutshell is > measuring user churn statistically is quantifiable and gives people the sense of securityyou can at least know it. > > measuring it based on how many truthful interactions youve got is what can keep you prospering long-term. because when you have a truthful interaction, thats a micro-win both for you and the other person. and if you win now, youll keep winning. _ _ originally posted here","44":"what is the best place to find beta users for your product?

any best practices? hey guys, i'm wondering how you are pitching your saas to potential leads who have requested a demo; specifically in b2b context selling complex solutions. furthermore, we are trying to commoditize our solution for smaller organisations, thinking about automating and scaling the demo game. few qs do you meet face to face, or mostly in web presentations? which conference tools are you using? go2meeting, skype...? how much time do you actually spend demoing your solution ? what percentage of your demo do you use to talk about your prospect's pain points? do you have any best practices to gain and retain your audiences attention? especially in remote demo settings? do you use pre-recorded\/generic demo videos as part of your qualification process? have you ever changed the way you do demos? to be fair, for the past five years we have been doing the exact same demo path over and over again. we did not reflect a single time on what we were showing and doing. most demos last around 90minutes of which we usually spend 60min in the software. i've got the feeling that we are losing our audience especially during remote demos; there is just too much distraction like emails, phones... and we dont have any control over our listeners... would be happy to hear your toughts, feedback and answers or any best practices! i'm afraid our demo \/ win ratio is rather low despite investing too much time... thanks!","46":"how important is\/was a .com to you?

hi, we're having an internal debate regarding the tracking of unqualified leads. the debate raised a good question - how would you go about tracking a large number of unqualified leads that are effectively contacts. these more or less just end up being impressions relating to your product. for example chats we have with people on drift, chats with people on slack, people reaching out to us via email, contacts from lead magnets - etc. there is seemingly value in measuring the number of folks we're able to extract from this larger pool of folks engaging with our brand, but it's not clear this is going to be worth the effort. what do you folks do?","49":"what is it that can take me to higher mrr figures? your users decide to leave your software product. could it be that their experience wasn't personal enough? why would that be of any importance? does it apply in other fields of business? let's think about it. we all know women who have their hairstylist and to which they've been going to for years they're definitely not looking for alternatives as all's good. the mental and emotional price they'd need to pay in order to find a new one is kinda high and it's not worth paying it when everything seems to be fine. in fact, they actually might be served better by someone else it is possible. however, the mere thought of breaking the personal connection is too much. why is it that they're stuck with their hairstylist? i would say it's pretty much the fact that their experience is personal enough for them. they've been knowing each other, have been interacting for some time and vetted each other. how does is that relevant in tech? creating an experience as a tech company is more complex than a hairstylist and their clients. besides, i know you also want to make it scalable. but i think here's where the fork in the road appears. most people look at scalable and choose serve everyone . because scalable can mean works for everyone . apple is for everyone, right? amazon is the same, right? wrong. arguably they are today but they surely were not in the beginning. amazon was for book people in the beginning. apple was for the techies who were part of the homebrew club. some years later, their imac was for the creators. their ipod was for music people. we can go on and on. eventually, indeed, audiences cross-breed but that's because of the very strong impact a company's hit is. which brings me to people who choose the other way in that choice i was mentioning above. these few people... understand that scale comes as a by-product of doing the non-scalable. it doesn't make sense, i know the math adds up only for the first road. but only through doing the non-scalable you can understand what is actually scalable and what isn't. and if that is too abstract, i'll say this you absolutely need to be as personal as possible for as long as possible to your users, before going into full scale. because only through spending a lot of time with extremely personal experiences you can notice patterns and automate your way to millions of or $ in mrr. sweet, right? not at all, it may seem. but it indeed becomes bliss to do that on the daily if you're not about getting there quick right now and rather enjoying the road to getting there .

and fair? your preference for the straightforward is still a preference. your expectations for what you need are simply yours. > >its all a story. > >great marketers dont invent frills and fluff in order to create value. great marketers have the wisdom to know that they will be judged and the practical empathy to go to where those that would judge them are. to which i'd love to add a couple of things. this applies generally when we talk about marketing but naturally as we go down the crevasses of some industries, things differ a bit. which is the case for saas. good and fair have a much stronger meaning in our industry, since we're talking about analytical people on both sides of the deal . therefore a certain phenomenon doesn't really happen in saas competing mainly on price. maybe it does but we don't get to hear about it. here's basecamp's pricing page. their right column might be competing on price but that's not everything. they show that you'll get what these people do in a cheaper manner but the main thing is that you have google suite, dropbox, asana premium and slack all-in-one. yes, add on top of that the story and personality. the frills and fluff that seth mentions and the empathy to understand that their audience will respond to the smiley face in their logo and the pastel colours. question what are the frills and fluff that will work on saas buyers, per your experience? and by work i don't mean they're some magical spells that will manipulate them to your advantage. i mean something that will work like the smiley face in basecamp works for young ambitious programmers whose missions are to change the world into a better place. they won't react too well to microsoft's pitch microsoft is looking at multi-billion corporate deals, where the other party is wearing a black\/navy suit and tie. the same way the people in suits won't really take basecamp seriously.","58":"how long is your trial period?

when our team started to grow and the number of tasks connected with helping customers increased dramatically, we understood that the simple they ask we answer way of help doesnt work anymore and the support process has to be changed. subconsciously we knew what to do, but were not sure. thats why we decided to talk to different saas companies to collect their experience about how to support and drive success, rethink and implement. and how do you do it? what is your secret? originally posted here","60":"how to scale\/automate your software demo? hi all, i'm working for a saas-light company selling complex b2b-platforms. demos are required in order to educate the customer and explain the core features and differentiators . current sales cycle is approx. 3 - 12 months and we speak to at least five different stakeholders per prospect.quite a laborious exercise... when thinking about scaling our product demo, there are two steps which are of importance to me. its not about doing 100 instead of 10 demos a week . its more about becoming more efficient and closing your deals in less time. plus, serving smaller businesses with automated demo as they tend to demand as much time as a large corporate customers, for comparably little return = more time to focus on the big deals. long story short, i'm thinking about automating the following sales-steps scale during discovery phase as customers are becoming more and more independent, researching products online, i was wondering how many of you are providing on-demand demos\/video recordings of the software on your corporate webpage? do you provide this kind of input at all? how do you make sure people actually see the right piece of content that is aligned to their needs, rather than a generic video which does not resonate with their pain points? what kind of personal information do you gather before showing such automated video? if so, what is your experience - does this lack of personal contact reduce your number of leads? follow-up after in-person demo once we have done a face-to-face or at least remote demo with the core team or our innovation champion, many other demos might follow. have you ever thought about e.g. putting together an individual storyboard per prospect with specific video-snippets of your software? like a link you could send them which they will share internally with all other stakeholders, that is providing a snappy summary of your system and how it is solving their needs? instead of exchanging 100 of emails, explaining the same stuff over and over again, being highly dependent of your champion - this could make life much easier. and potentially enables you to track the engagement\/who is watching what video. &; in my opinion there is a clear need to automate and scale the demo business, but i'm worried the lack of personal interaction will have negative impact on the relationship - especially during the discovery phase. feedback appreciated!","61":"what type of company is mirakl?

scaleable means youre building your saas product 3, 5 or 10 times as fast as someone whos doing the same work, but manually. economies of scale, they call it. weve seen how tech giants are in the topmost profitable companies and its no wonder technology in itself means scale. weve also seen this tendency to focus only on scale, to the point where saas founders dismiss some ideas, simply because they cant be scalable from ground 0. yet the catch is this building a saas that can generate +$100,000,000 in revenue means that you come up with a scalable plan and do the unscalable work until it reaches that point. like a snowball. what i said so far quickly explains an article thats popular in the saas\/startup industry do things that dont scale by paul graham work that can be scaled by someone else is useless. doing grunt work that can not be scaled means youre going to show that youre better. better, by the time youre able to put in, the passion and all the other factors that show why you deserve it. if you really want it, youll spend 9 hours every day on that. and slowly but surely, the gap between yourself and the competitors will widen. for your saas product to reach that tipping point where youve done enough grunt work until it scales, youll need to pick the grunt work very carefully. youll need to pick the grunt work that its further from the imminent danger or scale\/automation otherwise youll do it for 6 months or 2 years and in the meantime, a competitor will come up with something that will blow past your grunt work. this is originally posted here. i linked it as the essence of the article is above, and copying the whole article wouldn't make it a good fit for a reddit post. in the link above, i give 5 examples of both good and bad scalable\/unscalable things you can pick up on. let me know below what you think.","64":"how to handle sales tax for saas side projects?

reached back out asking for a quote for how much it would cost to do the integration, basically paying me to build something i was going to build anyway. integrating with accounting software is currently not planned until after beta. the one that they use is popular so they would not be the only one to benefit from the integration too. my time as a developer is stretched really thin right

stranger to moving fast and breaking things. in high school, roeder was teaching herself how to build a website. she finished college at 20 and started a social media consultancy at 22. 7 years later, laura launched meetedgar . does your mvp lack focus? perhaps you need to know your customers better. roeder had a dream list for edgar a mile long. but her husband and technical co-founder, chris, kept her focused. he had extensive experience . i learned from him to keep things as lean and simple as possible. he kept focusing on whats needed now, versus everything else we could do after the launch. theres a never-ending list of features you can create. im a huge believer in lets face it. pricing your product isnt easy. roeder was no different. pricing is really hard. we never felt like we got this right. from my previous businesses, i learned about the joy of high pricing. a lot of people underestimate the difficulty of getting five-times more customers when comparing $10\/month to $50\/month. although meetedgar now offers one plan at $49\/month, once upon a time there were more higher-priced plans. specifically, there was a business plan at $550\/month and an agency plan at $1,000\/month. we put them on thinking maybe if a big customer wants to come to pay us a lot of money, well let them. but surprise, surprise. thats not how it works. , you need a sales process. we are only focused on small business. we dont have a sales team. we do weekly demos that you can sign on, but theres no one to give you a one on one sales process with the company, _ . 3. paid advertisements. 4. sales. 5. business development and partnerships. i talk more about these five channels in, although meetedgar now focuses a lot on seo, ads were a major play in the beginning. cashflow is an important part of a successful business. a dollar today is worth more than $5 in a year. and ads can be an excellent opportunity to get results faster. in saas, the sooner you can get a customer, the better. so we spent way more into paid ads in the first year than we have ever since. we had a large spend. organic takes time, where paid is instant, unless you have insane luck. you can pay google and facebook the audience you can afford. are you curious about what ads performed the best? for roeder, it was telling small business owners they were a new tool. i love saying you are a new tool, even when youre not new to the market. the reality is, you are still new to people far after you launch. we would advertise on competitive businesses that liked hootsuite or buffer. our ad said we were a new social media tool. people are curious and are like, i wonder what that is? lets check it out and see if were interested. ads can be an excellent way to generate new sales. but once youve invested $1, the money is spent. after the first year, roeder moved most of the paid ads budget to content marketing, organic search, and word-of-mouth referrals. we did a lot of little content things. podcasts are a big part of our strategy. i love podcasts because theyre less time than guest posts and similar results. after the back-and-forth of booking, you show up and talk for an hour. since launching, now has over 300 articles. these pages brings in hundreds of potential customers as the pages rank in google for keywords like social media topics, linkedin articles, and instagram tv. laura roeders advice on the journey to 1,000 true fans a lot of early-stage entrepreneurs lack focus. to keep it simple, roeder suggests focusing on two areas. when youre building your startup, you have to focus on two things 1. customers need to know you exist. 2. your product has to be worth the money they spend. in software, engineers forget about getting things in front of people. then there are marketers who will throw out anything, then get an outsourced team to build a crap product. there are a lot of ways to get in front of customers. theres social media, content, paid ads, partnerships, among other channels. the best place to start is to figure out your community. you should find the forums, slacks, conferences, and meetups they are apart of. where are they? what are places they hang out, online and in-person? in-person is great to make a customer know, like, and trust you faster. but with a local meetup, youll talk to 10-20 people max at a time. online, youll get more reach, but less of a connection. but in the end, research will only help you go so far. at some point, you need to make a choice. you need to figure out your target market. sometimes you just need to pick. for example, you might say i find bookkeepers are fun to hang out with. but accountants are more valuable. you just need to make a guess and go with it. _for more articles like this,

company, but the product itself wouldn't make sense if it's more expensive than a couple of dollars\/euros. the idea is that people basically can pay to get notified when a store releases a specific product with a discount. in that case my clients would't pay more than the amount they can save. let's say i set the price at 1. looking at stripe's website, they would get 1.4% + 0.25, which is 26.5%. i think 0.25 makes sense for a higher price, but for 1 it just takes too much profit. do people know alternatives with a higher variable fee but lower fixed fee?","125":"how do you implement

library\/framework\/architecture do you use to give users of a saas to add their team members and share the plan?","145":"how notion grew without much marketing? i have been curious about notion's growth for some time now. recently i have come across the news item that notion is valued at more than $800 million, has one million users and upvoted by more than 6000 product hunt users. i couldn't resist researching their growth strategies. here is a micro analysis on my study originally started in 2014 with a seed round and a team of 4, notion has survived, pivoted and reinvented itself to become one of the most looked after saas companies today. for all its success, notions growth activities remained almost surgical. notion's growth has largely been organic. 1. product notions story is a true product lead growth story. it is an all-in-one productivity app. ease of use fueled by drag and drop functionality impresses its users. design has come to play a key role and became a differentiation. a lot of notions users talk highly of its product design. notion as a product is built largely as a one stop solution. once you are in its ecosystem you do not really to talk to other services significantly. hence they have not built multiple integrations like zoom or slack has done. however to make it easy for users to adopt notion, they have built easy integrations. these integrations are limited to those services from which users are expected to migrate. 2. traffic analysis over 93% of notions traffic is organic which largely constitute of direct and search traffic. this means majority of visitors are coming to notion directly using their url. this indicates that visitors were aware of the notion before hand. a highly targeted community based engagement has the potential to result such traffic. notion is in fact engaged in building a community. they organize meetups across countries and have built location wise local groups.they curate apps created by users in notion template gallery. most of notion's top keywords are branded . github and ycombinator are among the top referring websites in notion's traffic. having github as a major traffic source is an indicator of developers building apps on notion. why is ycombinator sending the traffic? we will find out soon. key takeaways if your product is such where developers, designers etc can create their own work, give them a platform to showcase it. build local chapters and communities. these high touch engagements go long way in improving customer life time value . 3. distribution over half of the startups from ycombinators most recent batch are notions customers. notion has also approached accelerators like 500 startups and techstars offering their startups $1000 in free credits. aws does this too. they readily sponsor startup competitions and offer $1000 in free credits. i had once received such a coupon. it is a different matter that even after more than 18 months i have used only $113 out of it as i find aws too complicated for me. targeting startups so early in their journey is a very smart play. notion counts companies with 100 or less employees as their core users. becoming an 'operating system for startups when they are still in incubator programs is an easy way to ensure continuous flow of new users for years to come. key takeaways clearly define who your customers are and where they are found en masse. target those channels with all you have got. 4. helping prospects to fight confusion two key steps in user's journey to select a solution to their problems are confusion and decision making. every company must try to help users at this stage. helping users fight confusion and make a decision in its favor. on its homepage notion features multiple gif showing the usage of its product. these gif quickly helps in showing the value of the product to visitors. some companies do it using images and explainer videos. i personally favor gif as they are light weight, non intrusive and quickly show the value. notion also creatively poach customers from its competitors. notion does this by boldly calling out unsatisfied users of evernote. they have built a dedicated resource to help such users migrate to notion in just few clicks. key takeaways shorten the users journey to value discovery build resources to help them fight confusion and take a decision in your favor. make it super easy for unsatisfied users of competitors to migrate to your product. entice the ones sitting on fence. this will require building efficient single click tools. it is an engineering activity. 5. wsj article and ph launch notion saw explosive growth in 2018 with the launch of notion 2.0. in march 2018, they launched on product hunt. team notion had experience launching on ph. back in 2016, they launched notion 1.0 on ph which got hunted by naval ravikant. since then they have been launching updates and products every year on ph. during the same month, david pierce published an article praising the app on wall street journal. though i could not find any back story, my hunch is article on wsj and successful ph launch did not happen by themselves. media article had helped zoom too, to gain initial traction. however to make this happen, zoom team systematically engaged walt mossberg over months, even meeting him in person for a demo. key takeaways research well on product hunt launch. to gain first hand experience, launch product every time you have a new version. also launch blog or any other resource you have built to help users. all with same brand name. engage with superstar users on social or email. canva in its early days found out that guy kawasaki is using their product. they met him in person and roped him as their evangelist. guy loved the product so it was an easy deal. someone with following like guy kawasaki talking about your product in high spirits is worth his weight in gold. i am very sure that being hunted by naval ravikant in 2016 had helped notion build credibility. engage with industry analysts and journalists. this is easier than it sounds. by nature of their work, they are on lookout for interesting stories. if you reach out to them to share your product months before you want to get published and keep them engaged with stories, chances are they will write about you. i for once chanced upon a journalist who had changed cities and was between jobs. she happened to write on something related to the domain of one my businesses. i readily helped her with domain research as well as offered her a free copy of a ebook i had written. we ended up being covered in one of her articles later. 6. paid advertising i could not find any of notions google ads. however they are running a handful of facebook ads with a single funnel facebook ad > free notion for students to be very honest, there is nothing exciting in their facebook ads neither the company seems to be going big on ads. this should act as a reminder that paid advertising has nothing to do with saas companies atleast for first few years. i usually argue for using facebook ads to determine the positioning by generating statistically significant data. using ads for growth experiments is different from using ads as acquisition channels. key takeaways if you are a new company, stay away from paid ads. improve product and positioning, build a repository of user research and build as many organic channels of growth as possible. use ads for growth experiments if required. that's all! let me know what are your thoughts on these points related to notion's organic growth. also if you happen to find out something more, do share.","146":"what chatbot are you using? hi, anyone here using a chatbot for their saas landing page? what are you

how do you keep track of which customers agreed to specific versions of the t&c and when? i suppose we could build this into our application logic and store that information in a database. it just seems like there should be a plugin that works like intercom or something, where it recognizes which user just logged in, checks if they've agreed to the latest version, and if not prompts them to agree. that way updating the language would be as simple as creating a new version in this hypothetical tool. and storing an audit trail of when each user signed each version would be useful as well. right now they agree when they sign up but our billing system doesn't affirmatively store that information, its just a required field on the checkout form. any suggestions on how to manage this? we're a very small team with limited developer resources so just looking for an efficient way to keep track of this.","159":"what are the operating cost in saas? hi, what are the operating cost of saas application if you don't have a customers yet and you use aws as a cloud hosting?

many companies say that they dont have a clear and sophisticated strategy to embed data and analytics. some research reports show that when a company takes an integrative approach, it uses analytics as a key strategic driver of growth rather than using it solely for it. this, eventually, leads to accomplishing the desired results. if you want to thrive in the market, you must do things differently. for instance, it is important to get the most out of your data. likewise, you need to implement necessary changes on the organizational level after comprehending what the data explains to you. so much so, you have the data collected already now you need to ensure you use it and then enforce certain changes, which are required in the business. in this regard, you need to develop a data roadmap, which is a significant approach. after making the roadmap, you must follow it up. the best way to create a data roadmap is to make sure your corporate key performance indicators are automated. they must also be scalable and repeatable. the next step is to focus on stakeholders and describe the key issues you want to resolve. in this regard, you need to categorize the problems into data and compare them with system issues. most often, you will find that the problem is not with the data but how your employees are using and managing it. you must prioritize your tasks and evaluate the technical feasibility of the plan you have created for predicting churns. you must re-evaluate the progress every 2 or 3 months to stay on track.","170":"for the enterprise saas among us, how do you handle accounts receivable for recurring invoice subscriptions? our enterprise b2b saas business has a mix of credit card subscriptions and invoice subscriptions. the credit card subscriptions are handled by stripe with no issue. we've struggled to find a good solution for invoice subscriptions though. this is typically handled with a recurring invoice in whatever a\/r product you can think of, but, they all suck imo, to be blunt. after evaluating many many platforms, we settled on zoho invoice because it was cheap and flexible even though it had some issues. our main gripe is that we want to have real-time or near real-time view into our mrr and arr. we made it work with zoho with an excel export and some clever formulas. however, now, our bookkeeper has convinced us that we need to sync our invoices into quickbooks, so we're on the market for a\/r software again. i evaluated quickbooks and the recurring invoice support is lackluster and the reporting for recurring invoices doesn't include the interval which is necessary for mrr\/arr calculations. what tools do you all use and do you use said tool to get mrr\/arr?","171":"what tools do you recommend for analytics and personalized user experience?

","174":"not sure which idea to pursue? try this math approach we all love saas apps and would like to find an idea that would be ideal for us. but it's not always easy to figure out which idea to pursue. maybe this idea is too hard to implement? maybe too many competitors? maybe it's not what i mentally interested in? we created a spreadsheet with the formula that allows estimating your ideas and pick up the right one. we listed 15 parameters that any idea can be estimated with. each parameter has its own weight and participates in the common formula. the result is based on the influence of every parameter. our ideal product has a scrore 454 points. real products have much fewer points. it's probably not a good idea to compare real products with an ideal one but you can compare real products each with others to pick up a product with a higher score. these parameters are 1. how easy to find first clients - it's critically you will able find first adopters as fast as possible. 2. how easy to create a first working version - if it's very hard to create a working product we will subtract points instead of adding. 3. if it requires making regular content - all the product require creating at least marketing content but it's better when it's not required for the product itself 4. if it requires a lot of content as a product - better not to be dependant on the content volume 5. if i know the subject well and can create content easily and with a pleasure - you shouldn't pick the idea if you are unfamiliar with the subject 6. target audience - it will be harder to work with a smaller audience but a niche audience is good . 7. is it easy to validate an idea - a landing page, survey, several phone calls or emails - if it's enough, it's good, else... don't pick the idea 8. it's rather a program or service , but not a content website , weight = 2 - we are fans of programs than content web sites. 9. if i'm interested in the subject - it's hard to work on something that you are really not interested in. 10. will i have a personal profit from it - you have a chance to eat your own dog food and get profit from it. 11. how many competitors - it's not good if there are no competitors at all or too many of them - so subtract in this cases, else add. 12. vitamin or pain killer - pain killer is always better. 13. if it uses interesting, cool, modern technologies\/approaches - it may distract you but the point is you can use it as a good marketing trick. 14. do i have an idea how to monetize the product - having a good plan of monetization is always better. we also recommend asking people if they are ready to pay during your validation process. 15. how easy for others is to clone the product - if a product is easy to clone, maybe it's better to stay away from it. another way to avoid competition is to pick up a narrow niche. you can find the spreadsheet with the formula here find the additional explanations here please let us know what you think! did you find this approach useful? if not, why and what are your suggestions to improve it? thanks!","175":"how do i ensure data confidentiality for my potential saas customers? i built a django custom crm web app for a business franchise my family is operating. it's working really great that we're able to slowly transition to manage the business digitally . now, i had an idea to offer this software as a service to other franchisees . the good thing is that we pretty much run the same business model so there won't be much customizations to be done on a customer to customer basis. a concern i have though is how do i manage the data confidentiality with my potential customers \/ co-franchisees. this would certainly be a road block since they definitely would not give us access to their financial and operations data. i'm a complete beginner to the saas business model so i would want to get some thoughts on how this would work out, or if my idea is even valid. appreciate your responses!","176":"how do you find new ideas?

do you price based on response time? do you price based on response channel ? do you factor support into your core pricing or list as an add-on? ideally, we would get customers to pay extra for support, but this doesn't seem like a good experience as well as it doesn't really account for support that might be bug related. also, doing an sla based support will require a lot of process automation, so that is not the most attractive option for us. we're curious what other businesses are doing and what successes\/failures\/journey's you've had with respect to how you handle customer support ","181":"what do you think will be the next trend in saas company names?

ex if i had a cloud-based storage product, obviously google drive and dropbox are already solving that problem. but if i had a unique take on that , would i try to lead with those other unique features or would i have similar positioning to them focusing on the same general problem\/benefit we help you access your stuff anywhere, anytime, on all devices?

do these things to launch a saas startup often founders ask the question that they have a working product in hand but they don't know what to do next. this is a very interesting phase where you have a product in hand and you are excited to launch it. but this phase can turn out to be a nightmare. the core idea here is to start small and scale. at denovers define your features and the problem you are solving in a decent and summarized way. feature some customer testimonials. you can share your product with friends and family for free to get some early feedback as well as testimonials to feature. have a pricing table with a clear cta. faqs section closure cta of get a demo integrate google analytics. dont worry about all the kpis, just focus on the number of users per day, demographics, and acquisition and you are good to go. create an account on calendly and embed its link over all the get a demo ctas. bonus install inspectlet or hotjar. this will help you in visualizing the user journey and to know whats working and whats not. identify your user & buyer persona often founders make mistakes by considering user and buyer personas as one. at this stage, its super important to know who exactly will write a cheque for your product and who will use it. in most cases, its one but in some cases, these are two different personas. gear up for sales aka cold outreach this is important. now you have a product, a sales landing page, and buyer personas in hand. gear up for sales now. the first and important step is to directly reach your ideal prospects. go to angel dot co, 500 startups, etc, and find your ideal companies. track all of them on google sheets. use any of the email finding apps to find email addresses. craft a short and to the point pitch addressing how you will be solving the problem with a clear cta. just do a basic google search and you will get tons of articles on how to write cold emails. remember one thing, always prefer customization and quality over the quantity. research your ideal prospect and customize your pitch accordingly. start hanging out on communities i am sure you have subject matter expertise on any one topic, ideally, the one you have build a product around. start hanging out on communities like reddit, hacker news, indie hackers, etc. remember these communities operate on a two-way model. you have to give to take back. again, a basic google search about each of them would help you a lot. launch on product hunt now you are fully prepared for a product hunt launch. prepare for it in advance but dont take forever to launch. if not sales, you will get pretty good feedback with your ph lunch as the community over there is very supportive. start thinking long term aka content marketing its the right time to think big and for the long term. build a basic wordpress blog on your website or a publication on medium and start writing content around your niche. things you have done before have given you a pretty decent idea of what you should write about. create a basic content calendar and start producing content. you can hire good freelance writers as well. remember, invest the same amount of time in distributing the content the amount of time you are investing in writing it. thats super important. invest in good design there is a reason companies invest a fortune in design. good user experience will enhance the chances of conversion by 10x. try to improvise your product user experience. at we believe design is just not about how your product looks like, but its about how it behaves in your users hands. identify & scale until now you have tried different approaches. now take a step back and analyze the results. measure different kpis and see whats working and whats not. and when you find your sweet spot, just scale it 10x. conclusion running a startup is difficult and fun at the same time. instead of the result, you have to fall in love with the process of getting success. trust me, once you are in it, you will like to repeat it again and again. there is a reason serial entrepreneurs start multiple companies again and again in their careers. you will do the same, just fall in love with the process. i originally wrote this article on medium","233":"how to solve the problem where the site isn't valuable until you get a lot of viewers\/users?

one of the implications of gdpr is that if you have eu customers, you need to have a server physically located in eu. what we are doing is to maintain multiple servers in different locations, one in the u.s.a., one in eu, and one in canada, since some canadian companies require that. but this brings extra complexities to deployment, testing, maintenance, etc., since you have to do everything almost identical 3 times. and if you plan to even more markets, add that number. is there a better way to reduce this repetitivity?

follow aida and write copy that converts well. when you are starting up, its very easy to get lost in a lot of details and stressing over small trivial things. at this stage, its super important to keep things simple & stupid. the same goes for the landing page. at denovers i have worked with a lot of b2b founders by designing their saas & app products. often we see those founders getting worried about the copy. writing & developing a landing page for your saas or any product seems to be difficult but it isnt. with literally a zero background, you can come up with a basic but finished landing page with optimized conversions just in a day. for this, i will map writing a landing page copy with a framework called aida. aida stands for attention, interest, desire, and action; it is an eminent marketing model in terms of advertising, copywriting, and content paradigms in general. this particular hierarchal model breaks down the step-by-step process of the user journey, from the point they visit your site until the purchase is made. lets start exploring the magic. attention aka hero section of the landing page come up with a clear, captivating & attention-grabbing headline with a clear value proposition on the hero section of the landing page. dont try to come up with your own terminologies, instead, try to relate with your user. see what problems solutions they are searching for and try to add them as a keyword in your headline. ideally, capture emails in the hero section too along with a cta. according to marketing experiments research, over 90% of visitors who reported reading headlines also read cta copy. interest aka how it works now you have got their attention, its time to create some interest. tell your user in a decent and precise way the problem you are addressing and how you solve it. having 3 to 5 steps of how it works can also work like a charm over here. desire aka flaunt customer testimonials once interest is created, its the right time to flaunt some customer testimonials to ignite the desire in your customers mind. let them know how you have solved the pain points of others, bringing them the transformation they needed. this will, in return, hit them on the subconscious level how well you can do it for them as well. if you are just starting and dont have enough customer testimonials, share your product with friends and family for free. this will not only get you some testimonials, but it will also help you in getting early feedback which is really crucial at this stage. action aka pricing with a clear cta well done, you have got your readers attention, have sparked interest and desire in them. now its time for an action. guide them with a clear call to action. have a super clear lucid pricing table with clear cta. its up to you what you want them to do, maybe you want them to start a free trial? or you want them to contact us? or book a demo with the sales team? whatever the goal is, make it clear. adding an explanatory faq section, in the end, will play a major role in eradicating all concerns and ambiguities in the readers mind bonus test & iterate testing on regular basis is super important. again, there is no need to get lost in a lot of details. just do these two things install google analytics & hotjar. this will help you in visualizing your users journey and to know whats working and whats not and then will eventually help you in doing rapid iterations, as they say. at there are some cases where i added a dialog box in the conversion flow which improvised conversions by 10x. conclusion coming up with the first copy of your landing page with a high conversion goal is fairly easy. you just need to understand the value you are providing and translate it in a simple way as possible. aida framework will not only help you in writing landing pages, but it can be applied easily to writing newsletters, ad copies, headlines, etc. need some help?

part of the solution is knowing the problem you are hiring for. having been a people manager for a couple of years, i wanted to highlight what i believe are important factors... share your experience, please throwing more bodies at a problem will not solve it faster. in my previous job, as my boss and i were hiring a second person to join me in sales, she told me that hiring another me wouldnt double the sales output. this isnt to say that im better or more productive than whoever was to join our team, but that with new and more people there will be new layers of inefficiencies, such as admin work, training, misunderstandings and so on. to avoid slowing down the growth of the business when new people are joining, its important to have a clear onboarding and training plan if not, new starters will be spending much longer learning the job. know the problem you are hiring for. if an organisation is struggling with sales, hiring more sales people may be the completely wrong approach. taking the time to investigate and identify whats stopping sales can reveal problems you didnt know of. for example, customers might be unhappy with the product you are making in which case, the solution to more sales could be hiring someone to improve the user experience. poor behaviour is contagious. at work were part of a team and were reliant on each other. if colleagues are just doing the bare minimum, constantly complaining about their job, or in general have a bad attitude, they will bring the rest of their team down. their lack of responsibility and integrity will spread like a disease to colleagues they will see that poor behaviour is accepted, and will be less motivated to work hard. hire only fully formed adults who take responsibility for themselves and their team members. honest feedback. do you have some colleagues that have poor, demoralising or ineffective habits that really annoy you? the truth is that it probably annoys a lot of other people too, and they are probably not aware of their habits themselves, as no one has ever told them. whether its constant late comings, demoralising comments, ineffective work or anything else, its impeding growth and we do everyone a favour by giving them honest feedback. enable and empower people closest to the problem. senior executives and manager are often not aware of everyday challenges of the business, such as poor customer experience or malfunctioning systems. the doers those who code software, speak to customers and welcome people in the reception must be empowered to report internally when somethings not working right, and enabled to fix and improve the situation themselves. that can be something as simple as giving them admin rights to a specific software, so they can log in and correct whats not right. this post was originally posted on danielsblog.substack.com.","279":"how are you protecting your saas services as a customer?

we are building a product in aws and as you might know there are certain cost like data transfer and time of running certain instances that might need to be transfer to the customers through the price of our product. i find very tricky to have clear tiers for pricing with those variables as there might be some items that are not related to the product itself. it's annoying enough that we will have to build features for customers to track that information. on the other hand, if we leave it out of the equation we can get a huge bill to pay that we won't charge to the customers and that's not an option. i've found that some products actually mention those details in their tiers pricing but i guess it creates some barriers as it's kind of difficult for clients to estimate the usage of those variable items - at least it's for us that we are building the tool and using aws. on top of that it might not cover all the scenarios if the variables are fixed like if we offer storage of 20gb and they want 100gb. so the pricing model there might require apply some options that will be charge extra on top of the default. a solution that i saw, but still doesn't convince me, is to give the concept of credits to customers and they can manage their budget. the problem with that is that we will be taking the heat if they screwed up by spending their credits mostly in items that are not related to our product like data transfer for example. how do other people in this sub transfer those fees to customers?

i have mixed feelings about starting a discord server so early on. first, i think it's a great place to discuss features or bugs or to help troubleshoot issues, whatever they might be. basically, it's great because of all the things that makes discord great. but...then i begin to wonder what it's like to be a customer and join a discord server with very low membership\/activity. if no one's there, no one will want to be there. there may be other negative aspects related to this. so, i guess, i'm asking when it's smart to start a discord server, in general? is it better to wait for a large audience beforehand, or does one just open it and promote it and then wait...either until the people come or until it's clear that it's time to pull the plug on discord...? for now, i'm in favor of the former starting a discord server early and making sure that regardless of how many people use it, they all feel welcome, heard, valued, and better off for having access to the server. thoughts...?

using stripe with taxjar\/avalara\/quaderno, how are you handling filing tax? i've done some basic research in regards to payment handling + taxes and boiled it down to two options. note this is for saas businesses interested in offering their product\/services to customers all across the world. . 1. use stripe + sales tax solution like taxjar \/ avalara \/ quarderno. 2. use a merchant of record like paddle or gumroad which handles payment + sales tax + tax filling. i have a question about option 1, specifically how do people handle tax filling? it seems like from what i've researched people who have done option 1 are only filing taxes in the country they are operating from. so if they from us, then they are mostly concern they're collecting taxes for folks buying anywhere within the 50 states and i presume they are filling using their accountant. same goes if the saas business is operated from europe, they seem mostly concern of handling vat taxes but don't appear to be concerned about collecting\/filling us taxes. i presume most regular accountants are equipped for filing taxes for the country they're in, not for the entire world, unless of course, they deal with accountants from the big 4, which i doubt people most people here are doing. what am i missing\/not getting? 1. are those sales tax solutions handling tax filing as well? 2. are there accountants\/services that handles tax filing for the wherever a sales is done? 3. you don't really have to care about foreign tax filling? or not care about tax filling aside from us and europe? basically if you go for option 1, how are you handling tax filing for sales coming from anywhere in the world? p.s. i get that option 2 is very much preferred and the added cost is nothing to fret about. i wish to understand how people remain compliant via option 1.","381":"where do i start from a technical standpoint? i have an idea for an saas ai marketing tool, but from a technical standpoint, i dont know where to start. i

startup gets acquired? a younger version of me, and a younger version of slideben's youtube channel, started a series called startup funding explained. we went through a theoretical companys story while analyzing how the cap table evolved through various rounds of funding. this article will analyze a few exit scenarios for that theoretical company and how much money everyone does, or does not make. to give credit to everyone involved, a lot of the topics covered here were way beyond my expertise so steve barsh from dreamit ventures helped me put these estimations together. in a nutshell, heres where the company is at, raised a seed round of funding through a convertible note. raised a series a round of funding, which valued the company at $10mm. the investors on the series a negotiated a liquidation preference that guarantees them 2x the capital invested. a series a round would probably have additional terms, but we are trying to keep it simple for the article purposes. we also had two option pools, the first one with a strike price per share of $0.0312500 and the second one with a strike price per share of $1. if some of this stuff doesnt make sense, again, check out the third episode of startup funding explained on slidebean's youtube. lets look at the cap table founder 1 4,000,000 33.96% founder 2 1,500,000 12.74% friends & family investor 2,000,000 16.98% employee 1 250,000 2.12% employee 2 250,000 2.12% convertible note investor 500,000 4.25% option pool 2 500,000 4.25% series a investors 2,777,778 23.58% now we will go over two scenarios a rescue acquisition or acqui-hire and a strategic exit for the company. lets get to it! scenario 1 an acqui-hire lets say this company started struggling soon after the round. it has managed to stay afloat, but its not growing very much. the company might seek out a buyer that has an interest in taking profits out of the business. there are some holding companies or funds that purchase saas companies and are very good at monetizing them. a saas company usually operates on a 7585% gross margin . the remaining costs are support staff, technical\/product team for new features and maintenance, and the operational costs office, accounting, etc. these holding companies acquire multiple saas companies and have centralized, shared operations, accounting, legal, developers, and support. these resources are shared across all the saas companies in the holding company to squeeze a lot more profit than the company can do independently. they are not buying the business for strategic reasons. they are buying it to earn profits from it, so the acquisition price will probably be a 1x to 2x multiple of their revenue. another common scenario is for a company to absorb the team and perhaps a patent or a brand name. in those cases, some price references are $1mm per engineer, or merely enough to give investors a 1x return on their investment so that they can greenlight the deal. if you think the $1mm per engineer sounds like a lot, it may not be. if the average base salary in nyc or silicon valley is $130,000 per engineer, and you could hire a team of 5 or 6 engineers who have worked together for years and are a highly efficient team, the price may not be crazy. in particular, if this is an acqui-hire at a very low purchase price, the engineers employee stock options may be worthless if they are underwater. >underwater means the startups price per share at acquisition is below the stock option strike price for the options the engineers have. so the stock options are worthless and the acquirer is giving an incentive for the engineers to stay on. note that the $1mm per engineer may involve a retention component to make sure the engineers dont just get the $1mm at closing and then walk out the door. again, none of these acquisitions are very exciting, but they can provide a soft-landing for the team and some liquidity for investors. there can be an inherent tension here as sometimes the founders are more interested in retention bonuses for the team while, on the other hand, investors are more interested in cash for the stock. often there is a lot of negotiation that takes place around these points. long-story short, lets say our theoretical business with a $12.5 mm post-money valuation after the last round gets an offer for $12mm. so the first thing we will get with that is a price per share. we had 11,777,778- so a $12mm offer means $1.019 per share. however, we have to start with that liquidation preference. series a investors need to get a 2x multiplier on their original investment, and convertible note investors too . so out of that $12mm, we will take $5mm for the series a investors and $1mm for the convertible note investors . thats $6mm that effectively bought out the preferred shares, which leaves us with $6mm for the rest of the shares . that is $6mm divided by 8,500,000 shares for an effective $0.7058 per share. but were not done yet. we have to do a small parenthesis about stock options. stock options stock options are options to buy shares at a specific strike price. they are designed that way for two reasons, 1. when they are issued, the person who receives them doesnt have any tax implications. since they are not receiving the actual shares, they dont have to pay tax on them. 2. the employee receiving them is motivated to increase the value of the company. if the companys price per share doesnt grow, the stock options are not worth anything. lets say an employee has 1,000 stock options at a strike price of $1. if the company gets acquired for $2 per share, they can effectively execute their stock options and then sell them for double the price, which the acquirer is paying. so 1,000 stock options bought for $1 each, sold for $2 each, theres a net earning of $1,000. great! employee stock options have a lot of moving parts. when structuring stock option plans make sure to have accountants and lawyers working with you who have a ton of experience with this. if your aunt or uncle is an attorney and largely handles divorces or personal injury cases and says im happy to help you, say no thanks. if this is not done correctly, a poorly structured stock option plan can have devastating consequences. from vesting schedules to cliffs, to how long to exercise after separation and how long until options expire. expiring options can be a big issue at companies that stay private longer, like uber and airbnb, where employee stock options may expire if it takes too long for the company to get acquired or go public. if the stock options are going to expire employees may have to come out of pocket and put money down to actually exercise and buy out the stock options so they can get the actual stock before the option expires. now looking at our scenario, youll see the problem. the second stock option pool this company offered has a strike price of $1. the price per share for this acquisition after paying the liquidation preference is $0.70. its not worth buying shares to resell them for less. so we can assume that the second stock option pool doesnt get executed. that means the company only has 8,000,000 shares to sell. at 8,000,000 shares, we have a slightly higher price of $0.75 per share. and that is the price well be using. cap table founder 1 4,000,000 founder 2 1,500,000 friends & family investor 2,000,000 employee 1 250,000 employee 2 250,000 founder 1 sells 4,000,000 shares at 0.75 effectively getting $3m. founder 2 gets $1.125m for the shares they vested. friends and family investor gets $1.5m, a significant 30x multiplier on their investment. not bad at all! the employees that hold stock option pools have to buy their shares. they have 500,000 shares total, which they purchase at the strike price of $0.023, so they have to pay $11,500 for them. simultaneously, however, they sell them for $0.75 each, which gives them earnings of $0.727 per share. since each of the two imaginary employees had 250,000 shares, they get profits of $181,750. not bad. or is it? if they had been working at the startup for several years and had taken a below-market salary in hopes of getting rich from the stock options and over 3 years got another $180k in taxable cash maybe the $60k per year was a small win but not totally life-changing. all that money is, of course, subject to taxes. so be prepared to take a chunk out of it. if you are a foreign founder, not registered as a us taxpayer, its going to be a flat 30%. and thats that. scenario 2 lets look at the second scenario, a sexy acquisition. lets say the company gets bought for $35mm. in this case, the price per share would be a very sweet $2.972. the liquidation preference clause doesnt apply in this case since the price per share guarantees these investors a 2x return. the math here is a lot easier. the number of shares owned by each shareholder, multiplied by $2.972. now interestingly enough, a $35m acquisition sounds like an amazing deal for the founders. the founder who stuck around is getting an $11m exit, which certainly changes anyones life. even the second option pool of employees is getting gains of $1.972 per share. they will need to virtually pay $500,000 to buy those shares but get $1.485m in exchange for them. remember, this is a cashless transaction, so the option pool holders dont actually have to buy the stock options, they just get the difference in price. but the investors, not so much. they are getting a 3x return on their investment, which is good, but certainly not what venture capital investors are in for. the success rate of tech companies is low, so investors are looking for the big whale, the big 10x return that makes up for all the companies that didnt work out. this company is making up for 3. this directly connects to a common question i get from founders, around business valuation, and even around the type of company that can raise venture capital. even this pretty successful company, getting acquired for $35m, is a meh story for its investors. if you intend to raise venture capital you need to have a clear path to that $100mm or more valuation. now you understand why, hopefully.","389":"what do you look for in a cto\/vp of engineering? i guess its mostly a question for more experienced business owners but when looking for

is it wise to migrate from wordpress to nextjs? hi everyone, i am thinking of migrating our marketing website for saas from wordpress to a static website in nextjs technology. the reason is that we from time to time spend more effort on maintaining wordpress website than we would like to, on things like caching setup, reconfiguring plugins, customizations workflow till it reaches prod environment, and harder to customize for some advanced frontend widgets we want to put on certain pages... if you used static website generators, such as nextjs or gatsby, i would like to hear if you experience any drawbacks?

well be launching our closed beta in august, with the plan to launch in full to paying clients a month or two later. thanks!","451":"how do you all handle your bookkeeping? i'm wondering how do entrepreneurs in different industries manage their bookkeeping ?

i know this is a very general question and i could probably find scattered answers throughout the community. but id like to have this post dedicated to defining problems. the reason for the post is mainly to see how i can be of most help\/value and be of service in the future in the saas industry. ive noticed a lot of companies struggle with optimizing their acquisition methods which usually just comes down to not understanding the underlying factors that play into successful digital campaigns of any sort. id like to help solve problems related to this. specifically for saas companies . my background is in marketing and have helped companies in various industries with their marketing and client\/user acquisition. initially i started by helping my dads company here in vegas generate more inquiries for high ticket luxury fireplaces and garage doors. i started with the website, did seo for it, ranked locally at the top, ran google ads for the different products, etc. i ended up generating too much demand for them to handle with just over 50 employees . they told me to shut down the stuff that was creating the demand and i actually went as far as increasing friction points anyways, fast forward a few months and im trying to help with internal efficiency issues since they told me to shut down my science experiment . there was some butting heads within the company on how certain things should be handled and by whom. and although i desperately wanted to help them scale up and generate more revenue in whatever ways i could, i just couldnt get management to agree on stuff . so i found an itch for making stuff more efficient during that time both with marketing\/sales and internally . this led me to pursue my own endeavors doing similar things but for other companies . fast forward to now, ive become passionate and curious about digital marketing, tech, customer psych, machine learning and many other areas that i wish i had the time to dive deeper into. thats how i found saas companies that are doing awesome things that can scale if they make tweaks to their approaches regarding marketing and sales and just overall acquisition methods\/approaches. so, here i am now looking for ways i can help in any way if you guys are open to posting about about areas youre struggling with or would like to get feedback on. please post your problem areas below. also, the more defined the problem is and the more information i have regarding any of the following - icp - price point - stage of the company - approaches\/channels that are \/ were working for what objectives - approaches\/channels that havent worked - areas of trouble within the funnel the better answer ill likely be able to give as a majority of you probably already know. before posting, lots of people ive met with think they have a lead \/ traffic volume problem when in reality, they have a quality problem. id love to dive deeper into that if thats something any of you would like more depth on. but i dont want to expound if thats not something anyone is struggling with thanks in advance for your questions and comments! hope this post is helpful! also if youd like to read a bit more about the psychometric ai company and how i helped generate more leads \/ users for them, ill throw the link in the comments. basically what we found was that using tests\/quizzes that spit out personalized recommendations for them are far more likely to be considered since its personalized and based on their answers to the quiz. part of this is the fact that theres no pressure for product consideration, they do it at their pace, they can back out at any time and just exit the browser they were taking the quiz on, and they know they arent being sold something dont want or need since its based on their input\/answers.","453":"how to monetise a product aimed at degree students?

a lot of people have been raising money recently, and some of the businesses i see raising rounds are speculative at best. i'm sure some will succeed, pivot, or otherwise generate returns, but surely at least a few of them will crash and burn wasting the investors money. i wonder though. if you're the ceo or part of the in-crowd so to speak in a relatively early stage company that fails, but that raised funding, is it worth it? do vc's and angels pay out the founding team when they grant a round such that the founders are rewarded for at least making it that far? or is everyone popping champagne and making a big fuss on social as a marketing ploy?","461":"what do you use to manage subscription plans?

i know it's really easy for people to say you should have revenue before quitting your day job. however, i just lack the will to work 60 hour weeks. as stated i have turned away revenue. i have failed before at a technology startup so i am packing those lessons into this go. if my system works, i will not need to work 60h weeks. i only need about 75% of my current income due to tax credits. the revenue i turned away would have yielded 25% of my current income. this is the tech i have left to build further work on iaac automations further work on integrations finalization of my microservice architecture some frontend work it feels like about 2 months of work ahead of me to get this business into a marketable state. i have a system for building video content to push onto ad networks with. i know it's easy for people to say i am overthinking it, but i wonder if those people have lost $10,000's in a startup before?

i loved handling support when our company was smaller, but we've been in growth stage for a while now and it's best that i hire someone to help handle this role. my problem is that a lot of the support requests we get often require some technical savvy, such as modifying our prod db most of the time, debugging code to figure out why something appears the way it does, writing one-off ruby scripts, and manipulating large text files in vscode. there's enough variation where i can't easily bake this into an admin ui without spending a _lot_ of time. do i just bite the bullet and devote the next quarter or two building out incredibly robust, domain-specific admin tools and hope the time i spent building it pays off later? i could hire someone technical to manage the role, but i'm also wary of giving other people prod db access , and technical support hires will cost a higher premium compared to a typical support hire. is this typical of other saas companies, and if so, how do they end up navigating this problem?

is it just lots of searching on linkedin? is it through your existing contacts? do you just buy your first leads? i'd love to know!","507":"what to do if client asks for bespoke feature and wants it exclusive?

hi r\/saas, we recently switch from beta to production mode for our new booking and scheduling saas. it is built for service businesses , so it is a b2b saas, but as it can be used for solopreneurs, it can partly be considered b2c we have managed to build up solid traffic . probably not yet fully qualified, but were quite confident that with content and cpc we do attract leads from the target groups. we have a free forever plan, a free trial, and still run a launch campaign, with a 70% discount. however, what we see is that theres a low % of people visiting the sign up page, and, even more surprisingly, the number of visitors that actually create an account . we will soon launch sso with google, linkedin and facebook. also, will revamp the signup process to be more engaging. also, these are our theories for what can be blocking - people click sign up too early, while they arent informed and interested enough about the product - not enough trust built at the moment of sign up - visitors are not that tech savvy and get confused - sign up seems a complicated process - people are just being curious to see what is it, but arent motivated enough to create an own account for each point\/theory we are preparing some experiments to run. but is there perhaps something else we are missing?

quotas every month with almost 1 mil in pipeline. ive been here 1.5 years in october, and they want to make me an sdr manager while i continue to call on enterprise accounts. cool. i actually love making cold calls. been a manager before. liked that too. thing is, faang is offering a lot of money for l4 sales positions that i feel im qualified for. i have an aws ccp cert and im working on my saa c02 now. so, i know i can make 120-140k somewhere if i look hard enough. help me be unreasonable. if they want to promote me and keep me, how much should i tell them im worth? ball is in my court now that theyve already announced their intentions. i feel like 175 ote with a 110 base seems like where id want to settle. tell them 190? more? less? what do you think? yoe 6 in sales, including 1 year management","522":"how about solopreneur for saas? can a single person do all things for saas like ideation , building , marketing , management etc... is it okay ? do you have any other

connect, should i go express or standard? i'm having trouble determining the best route here. i'm building a little fundraising platform, somewhere between gofundme, patreon, and buymeacoffee. the users don't have businesses for the most part, they aren't selling any products, they don't have websites, they're likely varying levels of tech savviness. i'm between stripe connect express accounts and stripe connect standard accounts. i'm leaning toward standard because the burden of refunds, chargebacks, and fraud would fall on the user to manage. however, the onboarding and dashboard are much more in depth and clearly made for people familiar with stripe or possibly have businesses already. express seems simpler and dumbed down , but then i have to manage things like refunds for my users and i'm on the hook for fraud which i'm not even sure how to prevent. plus both types ask a lot of details about the users business even though they don't have one. how did you handle this?","525":"when did you hire a sales team member?  hi, we started last year with 3 co-founders but one of the co-founders left. still on good terms, he was just too busy. their experience in jobs

dialing in our sales processes. i have heard the term sales playbook thrown around. this seems like a good idea, and i'm in the process of putting one together. basically, we want to hire our first team member and have them come into a very established role. to the founders we have a good inbound lead flow , understand our customers well, and know how to take them from stranger to customer. what was helpful when putting together official documentation on the sales process, so you could train someone else? how many sales rep came on? was it base+commission?","526":"what do you guys feel about

smaller saas by myself if i am not a coder? i want to just fund it myself, pay one to build what i need, and then pay as needed for changes. i come from a mix of tech and design background, and so i know enough to be the cto of sorts, and handle the built out of the basic site function\/design, but i cannot code anything being low level javascript. ultimately i would love someone to build it and

had any level of success doing this? would love any tips. thanks","537":"what are some examples of high ticket saas products? i'm looking for both b2c & b2b.","538":"how can i validate business owner authenticity in a scalable way? hello everyone! i'm building a small saas in the food area, and i'm trying to figure out a scalable way to validate that the user that's creating an account for his business is actually the business owner. currently, i'm doing it manually i do a little chatting and a small research about the business, then i mark the created account as a valid account, but i'm afraid that this will scale poorly. for example, one way i thought about doing it was to get the owner's email from google apis and then send a confirmation email with a link for validation, but unfortunately, as far as i know, google does not share this kind of information.","539":"what if there is a social media platform that cares about your privacy and doesn't show any ads whatsoever, will you use it? several months ago, i started to learn about online privacy of data and after learning about how some companies handle our data, i was concerned, sot i was trying everything i could to protect my data online, but there were several apps on which i couldn't protect my data and one of the apps were about social media, i was using them all day and i was spending most of my time on them, but they are data hungry apps that want as much personal data as they can, so i thought it didn't matter to protect my data as much because even if i try everything, i can't protect my data from social media and that's how i got the idea for this social media. i have a friend who also liked this idea, but we need feedback from people so that we can be sure that people want this so that we can start our startup. the platform name is ciao, it is a social media app in which your favorite content creators can upload most type of their digital content , etc. on the platform, which means you can get all of their content in one place rather than just clicking on bio to get that content or to search about their content on different platform. you can also buy products either digital or physical products from your favorite content creators on the platform itself. this social media doesnt have any ads which means, it is focused on your privacy of data. you have complete control over your data and not us or anyone. as i said earlier, we are not including any ads, which means the business pages will always get highest amount of engagement forever. we are also focused on minimizing spams as much as possible because they makes the user experience worse & that spam includes, fake accounts, fake information, fake followers, fake likes, fake comments and specially bots, etc. we have a future vision for this app, we want to create a vr world in which every user can use a vr device to connect to the world and they can meet their friends online, play games with them, talk to them, buy products either digital or physical and travel the world with them. we need your feedback on this survey ","540":"what do you use tools like chartmogul for? chartmogul seems to be a very common tool
