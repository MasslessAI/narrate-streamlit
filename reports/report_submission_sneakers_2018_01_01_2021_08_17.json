newer shoes seem to come with a more plastic type paper which i assume is less acidic, but i also could be completely wrong. i just assume over time manufactures realized the paper may have been causing unintentional wear and provided a better product. how do you deadstock a typical pair of new sneakers, and why do you take the steps you take? has there been a significant upgrade in the durability of the newer materials they use to manufacture? what do you think is most likely to be the case in terms of today's shoes deteriorating in a deadstock habitat?","1723":"basically what the title says. i dont have thousands of dollars to spend but i love the look of the semi expensive mainstream shoes. any places to show that has sales or raffles you know about?","1724":"particularly in northern virginia. saw a pair of defiant couture 1s, but they were a size too small. when i decided to just get them, they were gone.","1725":"i'm having trouble picking.","1726":"i'm just curious as to how many pairs you all still have on ice. right now in my collection i have 20+ and the only pair i still have yet to wear are my fear of god air raids, because the weather has been crappy since they came in. i don't have any doubles in my collection as of right now though, so all rock and no stock as of right now.","1727":"hey guys, i'm not a sneakershead and i don't judge this kinda people, i have just one or two pairs. i just wonder, how many pairs you have ?

nike doesnt say oh, its also gonna be sold at foot locker, finish line, east bay, etc. and, when i search those places i never see the shoe until after its launched and already sold out. id like a fighting chance at one day being able to purchase a newly dropped pair instead of just looking at the image on my phone or ipad and wishing i had been fortunate enough to have gotten a pair before they sold out in, 1 minute flat. until recently i didnt realize that bots were a thing. now that i know they exist i hate them and it surely explains why i can never get a pair on their release date. so, where do yall get this info on where, when, and by what method a shoe is going to be sold and whether by lottery, in store only, snkrs app only, other retailers etc?

sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.","2149":"i'll start off by saying i have a bias for canvas shoes. most all of my sneakers are canvas, and my reason for this was because of what happened one day at a music festival. it rained that day like crazy and at that time i was heavy into breakin' . my suede adidas were wrecked after that. yet in that same scenario, a canvas shoe usually holds up even better. now maybe i haven't tested other types of suede, but i'm just not the biggest fan personally. now let's get into style. i'm not sure what is up with the elf toe athlete sneaker boom, but it's not for me. i've found that more skate style sneakers keep a more traditional sneaker look, more so than basketball or any other style. vans to me is one of the best companies who you can always turn to in a pinch and find consistency with both great style and quality. plus you're not breaking the bank. yes, i'm also not the person who is going to drop $200 or more on a sneaker. sorry, but i'm still not making six figures to handle that kind of lifestyle with what i do. yet for some reason, companies like adidas hardly have any canvas style skate shoes in stock. the best ever being the neo men's hawthorn st black, which was both a classic look and easily the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn. seriously, there has never been another adidas sneaker in my opinion that has topped that. it is goat, more so than the shell toe ever will be. yeah, not a fan of plastic toes covers. so why is suede so overly popular? i don't seem to really get the reason for this. if any of you can elaborate on this, maybe i can understand better why canvas shoes are so hard to come by these days. i personally wouldn't mind more faux leather but adidas rarely combines good design with material that often. i even tried looking into the rivalry low shoes in red, thinking they had a good look, but i was bit too slow before they were sold out. i just like to get another pair of sneakers that combine sleek\/classy design with comfortable material that provides me not just a great look but a great feel as well. i need another pair of neo men's hawthorn st black.","2150":"got a 20% student discount for new balance but dont know too much about the brand. looking for suggestions for a pair of shoes i can pick up. something thats not white with us going into the autumn season. thanks in advance","2151":"it seems most of the comfy cushioned shoes are fabric knitted. i live in canada and knit shoes really arent suitable for the winter. the dirt water will stain and the feet will be cold because of ventilation. the only closest shoe i found were the stan smith boosts which were a limited time offer. ive tried nike air force 1s in store but they seemed too heavy and bulky, not to mention hard. do any leather shoes with comfortable cushion and thats suitable for winter exist?","2152":"do they fit tts?

yet, every one universally craps on every other jordan release. it seems like a few influencers\/sites arbitrarily hype a shoe and then the whole community follows suit by paying insane amounts of money for them. another shoe, with better materials and a similar colorway is just arbitrarily not mentioned or looked at. is there any way to predict?","2219":"personally, i could think of 3 factors 1. design - highly subjective as everyone perceives aesthetics differently. 2. comfort \/ technology - a factor which i believe, drove the sales of ultra boost 3. brand \/ quality - mainstream brands in the sneakers industry such as nike, adidas, or collaborations such as yeezys, y3, etc. pretty much guarantee that you're paying for trusted quality and lifespan. with that said, are there anything else that should be on the list? are there underrated sneakers out there that people should know? or perhaps overrated ones that just don't live up to their hype? discuss.","2220":"i usually wear 42.5-43 eu with air max. 44 huarache. thank you!","2221":"im debating if i want sunshine or flea, im doing a white shoe with green piping.","2222":"there filled with talcum pouder and i dont know if i should use a rough sponge or a soft one, how can i clean them without damaging them","2223":"i bought them 2 years ago, i don't wear them that much but enough for the leather to have a little wear and tear . yet the noise persists.","2224":"i wanna try paining sneakers myself, and with the holidays coming up i figured i could try painting sneakers for family and friends. where could i find the cheapest version of popular silhouettes?","2225":"i spilt some wood stain on my sk8-hi's van's and it got alot on the rubber part but also on the cloth can i get it out or am i fucked?","2226":"first, hope this is ok to post here. i have some converse but when i walk they make annoying squeak what to do to stop it ?","2227":"hey guys! so the question really does give everything away. i really love common projects and have two pairs of their achilles low. i also got oliver cabell's . i also got one from ted baker...and more. you get the idea the kind of sneakers i like. my main question is how do people avoid the above heel skin peel\/injury? i see a lot of asians rocking such sneakers without socks, and frankly with slim pants\/jeans just rising above ankle with those sneakers looks pretty neat considering one wears more solid colours. i have two such sneakers that are fully suede and they don't hurt the same way. however the fully leather ones can be hurtful unless i wear ankle high training socks from nike or the regular high socks from polo. so i just wanna tips\/tricks to reduce the skin peel and injury. it really makes it painful to walk a lot. thanks!","2228":"hello everyone! last year i bought the jordan 1 mid black orange peel in the last year i said to myself it would be nice to have also jordan 1, yellow, red, green, blue but i think i understood, correct me if i'm wrong, that new colors come out periodically, when they are sold everything can't find them anymore or, you can find them on sites like stockx, goat etc... but at very high prices. i think this logic does not apply to all shoes, for example the black or white air force ones always do it and the prices are low. if i find shoes that i like, how will i know if next year they will cost as much as the exit price or will they cost more?

hey everyone. i bought a pair of size 10 yeezy 700 waverunners and they are slightly big at the heel. the reason i bought a size 10 was because i bought a size 9.5 of the 350 v2 zebras that restocked around christmastime and they fit snug but comfortably. after that i bought a pair of size 9.5 350 v2 sesames and those were incredibly snug to the point i was considering selling them, but after breaking them in with paper shoe trees they fit pretty great, albeit still very snug. however before i broke in the sesames they restocked the 700 waverunners on the adidas app and i went with a size 10. my thought process before breaking in the sesames was they probably redesigned the new v2 zebras with the white sole and they fit differently, which is why my sesames are too tight but those fit fine. so i'll go with a size 10 on the waverunner so that they're comfy. now that i finally tried them on i'm noticing that the heel of the shoe slightly slips off my feet when i take steps. my toe is very near the front of the shoe, about half inch of space, but i have wide feet. i'm not sure if this ruins the comfort of them long term, and i'd rather know now before actually wearing them out so that i can trade for a ds 9.5 if possible. if not and i just have an extremely comfortable yeezy 700 that slips a little when walking i'll be happy as well. i have wide feet so i'm used to having shoe sizing difficulties.","2751":"just randomly came across my mind. personally thinking black\/white gats or 1s, the og royals in particular.","2752":"i just ordered a pair a while ago, just want to know their turnaround time considering the situation nowadays.","2753":"i've been growing a small collection of unbranded kicks, and i'd love some suggests on where to go next! i've got a handful of 350's and ultraboosts, but was looking for my next pickup- just without the adidas stripes or a nike swoosh.","2754":"what sneakers do you keep by the door that you just throw on to go on errands or go for a walk?

. why most of the shoemakers out there recommend you to regularly apply a leather conditioner to smooth leather dress shoes, but i can't find any videos telling you to do the same thing for leather sneakers? sometimes they apply shoe cream, but not more than that. also, they use an excessive amount of water to clean leather sneakers or even put them into a laundry machine, which you will never do for dress shoes. you just wipe them with saddle soap, etc. i'm wondering how to condition my leather sneakers. can i apply expensive saphir renovateur conditioner to high-end leather sneakers?","3705":"so i wanted to enter a raffle on the svd app, they said it would not put a hold on the money on my card. i have entered raffles before but with footshop and i get a 1euro or 0euro charge on my card which is refuned. but svd wants to charge me the whole amount of the raffle. does anyone know if they refund immediatly after, or after the raffle ends. how does it work?

it's definitely not just recently, the craze in my perspective has been around for at least a few years now, but i've never really understood how it came to be. now this is an actual curiosity of mine so don't get the impression that i'm tryna be demeaning to your hobby and interests, i have my own money holes haha, but fashion and i have never been the closest. i only noticed it when people started getting into the new nikes, talking about them hella, and then nike started releasing hella different models, and then adidas has a huge market for it now, and its just blown up. same with all the supreme, anti social social club wear, which i also don't really understand. it confuses me mostly because of two reasons. 1 i buy sneakers knowing they'll soon be in a i don't care if i jump in shit sort of condition so i never try to go over like 60 bucks which to me is already way too much and 2 some shoes, though this may be opinion, are downright toooo muchhh. like whoaaaa how much pink and green can go on a white shoe? and they're huge too. sometimes a couple of my friends will send pictures of a shoe and i'll just be like okay... cool... another reason is, people get get hella nice shoes and then are super scared to have anything happen to them. honestly i would never want to have to constantly be making sure the things i wear on my feet are getting dirty. i hate wearing new shoes because i'd like to keep them clean, but i know i need to have a few stains to be comfortable just walking around. like this guy put up a story today of the gums of his white sneaks having a little stain of brown and he was like omgggg noooo, and then cleaned it. but god damn how many more times will that happen haha. and i've always kinda wanted to shell out for white shoes, but screw keeping those bad boys clean. give me your stories!","348":"how do sean wotherspoons fit?

hi guys i'm looking to buy my first pair of yeezy 350 v2's and am a little worried about the sizing. the closest shoe i have to a yeezy is a nike roshe in a size 12 that i use as my beater shoe, and also a size 11.5 that fits snugger but isn't unbearable but i just like the fit of the 12 more. they fit comfortable with a good amount of wiggle room in the toe box i also have the pharrell hu v2 in 12 and it fits a little bigger than the roshe, but nike runs small compared to adidas so i kind of expected that. all the research i've done on the v2's say either tts or go up half size with insole or some even whole size up so i'm just unsure and was hoping maybe someone that was in a similar boat could give insight?

they are falling apart already! i've played 5 games of low intensity rec league ball with 4 on 4 and sub on the fly. not the highest level of competition, but for us its more about the love of the game. i've been using ball as my church, my escape, my therapy and my one true passion since i was a kid. 5 games into the season and a brand new pair of premium nikes have gone south!?! i'm not used to this kind of issue with nikes, and after talking with nike representatives, i'm frustrated with their lack of concern. i've spoken to nike online where they directed me to a call-in number. when i called, they said that since i didnt get them from a specific retailer, they can't do anything for me. i've contacted my ebay seller and they will not do anything for worn shoes. it seems like i am caught in a nightmare. does nike not care about their products anymore?

please help! hey all, long story short- i was visiting the philippines for the past month and stayed at my grandfather's ancestral home. it's quite a big hacienda type thing that's been going through pretty heavy renovations the past two months and is expected to go on until the end of the year. &; anyway reason for my post is that we had about 15 construction workers living and working on site. on the second day i was there, i noticed these dudes working in jandals and bare feet. only one dude had a pair of chucks- a size 12 but he was a size 8 irl and the only reason he had them because it was donated. broke my heart thinking if i sold some of my lesser used heat in nz, where i live, then i could probably get this dude and his mates something. &; so that's what i did. sold a few pairs over the last week, including my grail ow grim reapers and a couple of jordans and now have some cash sitting around. &; i'm flying back next month and wanted to get about 15 pairs of sneakers for these dudes and figured vans old skools would probably be the best way to go. decently durable, won't fall apart overnight, and they can probably even use it casually. &; since most of them even own a proper pair of shoes, much less have access to a shoe store nearby- asking for their size will be pretty useless. so i was going to get one dude to do the old foot on paper trick to get everyone's measurement for their larger foot and compare to the shoe size on the vans website chart. &; now, i need to know- are they generally tts? i have honestly seen everything on this reddit from 'go half size down' to 'they fit really snug, go a full size up'. if one dude has a 25cm foot- can i just easily convert that to whatever size it says online on their website ? if a dude wears a size 10 in say aj1's does that just translate to a size 10 for vans? thanks heaps guys!! &; tl;dr- went back home, befriended some less fortunate construction workers felt bad they work in bare feet since they literally cannot afford proper shoes want to get them proper shoes, settled on bulk buying some old skools will get them to send foot measurements so i can note what size it converts to for vans need to know if vans old skools are actually tts or big\/small in general. will be headed home next month and want to surprise them. &;","1526":"advice on the fit of ultraboosts?

i want to preface this by saying i did a search, and couldn't find a discussion on this. youtube has videos, but they mostly deal with og models or showing how blown out a shoe is by now. my biggest question is how much should we anticipate new shoes to decay while dead-stock? has the quality in materials improved over the years? should i be worrying about cracking the soles on newer releases if i just leave them in a cool dark place? i've seen the shrink wrap, although it's not very practical for myself. i don't have a huge collection of shoes i have on ice. i've heard of people simply placing shoes in ziplocks or wrapping them in saran wrap to prevent yellowing. i wrapped a pair of jordan infrared 6 in saran the day i got them and placed them back in the box while i wear the others. it seemed like a no brainer because of the ice sole and we all know what a pain they can be to keep like new. i recently bought another pair of jordan breed 4 i want to deadstock. considering there is no ice sole, is it worth it to wrap them or do anything different in order to preserve them for a few years? newer shoes seem to come with a more plastic type paper which i assume is less acidic, but i also could be completely wrong. i just assume over time manufactures realized the paper may have been causing unintentional wear and provided a better product. how do you deadstock a typical pair of new sneakers, and why do you take the steps you take? has there been a significant upgrade in the durability of the newer materials they use to manufacture? what do you think is most likely to be the case in terms of today's shoes deteriorating in a deadstock habitat?","1723":"new to the sneaker game, any advice on getting deals\/not dropping my bank account for some fire?

sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.","2149":"suede vs canvas why is suede over saturating the market? i'll start off by saying i have a bias for canvas shoes. most all of my sneakers are canvas, and my reason for this was because of what happened one day at a music festival. it rained that day like crazy and at that time i was heavy into breakin' . my suede adidas were wrecked after that. yet in that same scenario, a canvas shoe usually holds up even better. now maybe i haven't tested other types of suede, but i'm just not the biggest fan personally. now let's get into style. i'm not sure what is up with the elf toe athlete sneaker boom, but it's not for me. i've found that more skate style sneakers keep a more traditional sneaker look, more so than basketball or any other style. vans to me is one of the best companies who you can always turn to in a pinch and find consistency with both great style and quality. plus you're not breaking the bank. yes, i'm also not the person who is going to drop $200 or more on a sneaker. sorry, but i'm still not making six figures to handle that kind of lifestyle with what i do. yet for some reason, companies like adidas hardly have any canvas style skate shoes in stock. the best ever being the neo men's hawthorn st black, which was both a classic look and easily the most comfortable shoe i have ever worn. seriously, there has never been another adidas sneaker in my opinion that has topped that. it is goat, more so than the shell toe ever will be. yeah, not a fan of plastic toes covers. so why is suede so overly popular? i don't seem to really get the reason for this. if any of you can elaborate on this, maybe i can understand better why canvas shoes are so hard to come by these days. i personally wouldn't mind more faux leather but adidas rarely combines good design with material that often. i even tried looking into the rivalry low shoes in red, thinking they had a good look, but i was bit too slow before they were sold out. i just like to get another pair of sneakers that combine sleek\/classy design with comfortable material that provides me not just a great look but a great feel as well. i need another pair of neo men's hawthorn st black.","2150":"new balance suggestions?

yet, every one universally craps on every other jordan release. it seems like a few influencers\/sites arbitrarily hype a shoe and then the whole community follows suit by paying insane amounts of money for them. another shoe, with better materials and a similar colorway is just arbitrarily not mentioned or looked at. is there any way to predict?","2219":"sneaker lovers, what do you consider before getting a pair? personally, i could think of 3 factors 1. design - highly subjective as everyone perceives aesthetics differently. 2. comfort \/ technology - a factor which i believe, drove the sales of ultra boost 3. brand \/ quality - mainstream brands in the sneakers industry such as nike, adidas, or collaborations such as yeezys, y3, etc. pretty much guarantee that you're paying for trusted quality and lifespan. with that said, are there anything else that should be on the list? are there underrated sneakers out there that people should know? or perhaps overrated ones that just don't live up to their hype? discuss.","2220":"quick q how do jordan iv retro 2019 fit ? i usually wear 42.5-43 eu with air max. 44 huarache. thank you!","2221":"what design are you all getting on your cpfm air forces tomorrow?

hello everyone! last year i bought the jordan 1 mid black orange peel in the last year i said to myself it would be nice to have also jordan 1, yellow, red, green, blue but i think i understood, correct me if i'm wrong, that new colors come out periodically, when they are sold everything can't find them anymore or, you can find them on sites like stockx, goat etc... but at very high prices. i think this logic does not apply to all shoes, for example the black or white air force ones always do it and the prices are low. if i find shoes that i like, how will i know if next year they will cost as much as the exit price or will they cost more?

hola there, first post here but i have been following posts in here for a while. i'm creating this thread to submit to the community a way to compute a price which will please the seller and the buyer. as many of you living in a big city, i am using stocx as a tool to determine a price to buy or sell a pair but dealling of the app, for mainly two raisons - because the severall fees are outrageous and are, imo, an obstacle to some transactions - because sometime, meet up allow you to meet other fun sneakerheads. so you'll find the sheet here thus if i created this sheet it was to find a common ground with other counterparts whether there are sellers or buyers, because everyone want to use stockx to define their price, but following if they want to sell or buy they where showing the buy now or sell now price. that's why i use a really simple formula to take into account the several fees adding by stockx and divided on seller side and buyer side. here a quick example of what it's done the pair a sacai waffle ldv green og 9us buy now total price $ 613,50 sell now total price $ 502,33 so if you're dealing on stockx it's $ 111,17 on their pocket! if you're dealing off stockx but are using the sheet, it will give you a price of $557,92. fair for buyer, fair for seller. do not hesitate to give me feedbacks or explanation how you avoid annoying and long negotiation. if you find it usefull, do not hesitate to spread it and use it! t.","2242":"where to buy sneakers?

thanks to quarantine boredom, i just recently went through my sneaker collection to reminisce. i realized that i have amassed close to 9 pairs of yeezys, and it dawned on me how there used to be so much hype for these sneakers. once kanye made the move to adidas, there was no shoe on the market that was as desirable as yeezys. the combination of design, exclusivity, and hype was something that i feel like we didn't see until the nike off-white collabs years later. now, when i see yeezys i feel like they have sort have run their course in terms of being a cultural staple. they have become so ubiquitous that they are similar to roshe runs and ultra boosts, where new colorways keep coming but no drastic design changes are ever made. like they are acceptable in terms of style\/comfort, but they really don't have the sort of cultural cachet they originally did. in addition, i feel like they are so closely linked to kanye's public persona that it becomes an odd game of identity politics. they say what you wear says something about you, and i used to love yeezys to show how much of a fan i was of kanye. i was a full blown kanye stan up until recently, but i continued to rock my yeezys through the controversies. however i refuse to wear mine after jesus is king. i personally am not a fan of the whole overt christianity vibe, so that kind of ruined the shoes for me. if others are into that, i celebrate them and their right to be into that, but it is not something i want my sneakers to be synonymous with. it is not to say that i do not appreciate the cultural significance of the shoes themselves, i will likely keep them as collectors items going forward. but i do not see myself buying another pair. this is not a troll post by any means, i just want to see what the temperature is like out in the world. are yeezys still a staple in the culture?","2688":"how do the yeezy 380s fit?

hey everyone. i bought a pair of size 10 yeezy 700 waverunners and they are slightly big at the heel. the reason i bought a size 10 was because i bought a size 9.5 of the 350 v2 zebras that restocked around christmastime and they fit snug but comfortably. after that i bought a pair of size 9.5 350 v2 sesames and those were incredibly snug to the point i was considering selling them, but after breaking them in with paper shoe trees they fit pretty great, albeit still very snug. however before i broke in the sesames they restocked the 700 waverunners on the adidas app and i went with a size 10. my thought process before breaking in the sesames was they probably redesigned the new v2 zebras with the white sole and they fit differently, which is why my sesames are too tight but those fit fine. so i'll go with a size 10 on the waverunner so that they're comfy. now that i finally tried them on i'm noticing that the heel of the shoe slightly slips off my feet when i take steps. my toe is very near the front of the shoe, about half inch of space, but i have wide feet. i'm not sure if this ruins the comfort of them long term, and i'd rather know now before actually wearing them out so that i can trade for a ds 9.5 if possible. if not and i just have an extremely comfortable yeezy 700 that slips a little when walking i'll be happy as well. i have wide feet so i'm used to having shoe sizing difficulties.","2751":"which sneakers look best beat?

is it a case that you just cant beat the bots or am i extremely unlucky? the amount of times i pay resale for things, i wonder if i should stop exiting myself entering raffles and just jump straight on to stockx so that im not delaying the inevitable and wasting a shit tonne of my time genuinely curious of its the same for most. as if you took twitter as gospel you see the same people week in, week out saying theyve won some. people says that the companies favour certain accounts and others say the majority of drops just go to bots.","2791":"any unforeseen costs i need to pay attention to when buying on stockx europe?

i have been trying to read the faq's and such as much as possible, but seems like a grey area. stockx recently opened in london, uk to tackle this issue, but now with the brexit it seems even more confusing, seeing as i live in the netherlands. can anyone give me a clear answer on i should expect any extra costs\/fees which are not seen on the website?","2792":"how do you guys clean the inside and outside of your sneakers?

every single time i see the doernbecher jordan 4s, a dying brain cell of mine is triggered. back when i was a kid , there were a pair of shoes that were pretty popular that had a similar color scheme to those doernbecher 4s. mainly black, with neon green and blue accents. i remember there being a piece of plastic on the rear, kind of like the one thats on the back of the air penny 2. im pretty sure they werent nike, adidas, reebok, or even british knights. for whatever its worth, the sneakers even had a commercial, which is fairly meaningless considering that even payless had shoe commercials back then. couldve been one of those where the commercial came before the movie on vhs tapes, and all i remember was the kid ending up in a bathtub full of sudds, clothed, and with the sneakers on his feet hanging out one end to conclude the ad. so yeah, just curious. im really hoping that they werent payless , and while my parents always did get me trendy shoes for their time, i cant rule out payless. google turns up nothing. i think its secretly why i cant take the db4s too seriously lol.","3730":"where to buy from?
