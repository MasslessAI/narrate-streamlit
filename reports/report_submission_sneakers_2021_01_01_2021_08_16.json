for being such a cheap shoe, the insoles in the adidas deerupt are godly, and i think they may be my favorite of all time. now for the jordan 1 flyknit, which is 2 for me, i don't know if it's because the insole is outstanding, or if it's the zoom unit that i'm feeling . i haven't taken them out to use in different shoes to tell, but the smooth feeling is also nice. 3rd would have to be the off white odsy-1000. it's thick, so it gives the shoe a very nice feel that almost feels like they have an air unit inside. they're still 2 pounds a shoe, but they're great for just standing there lol. while i'm talking about insoles, i did buy those heff luxx insoles that were meant to give every shoe you own feel like boost , and i'm not getting it. they make my shoes feel tighter , but they just feel normal. it's not like they make jordan 1's feel like yeezys or anything, so $30 was a regret buy other than having something to not wear out the insoles my shoes come with.","344":"does anyone have large shoe boxes they like that theyd recommend?

recently, i have started buying shoe care kits and taking care of my leather shoes. after watching a few videos guiding how to take care of shoes, i noticed that shoe care routines are quite different for leather sneakers and dress shoes . for leather dress shoes or leather boots, the most common type of leather is smooth leather , and shoe companies are more specific in what types of leather they are using . meanwhile, for sneaker leather, they tend to say it's leather, and it is still kinda smooth, right? . why most of the shoemakers out there recommend you to regularly apply a leather conditioner to smooth leather dress shoes, but i can't find any videos telling you to do the same thing for leather sneakers? sometimes they apply shoe cream, but not more than that. also, they use an excessive amount of water to clean leather sneakers or even put them into a laundry machine, which you will never do for dress shoes. you just wipe them with saddle soap, etc. i'm wondering how to condition my leather sneakers. can i apply expensive saphir renovateur conditioner to high-end leather sneakers?","353":"does anyone know if svd is charging money from your card?
